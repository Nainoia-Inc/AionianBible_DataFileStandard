# BOOK	001	GEN	Genesis	Genesis
001	GEN	001	001	In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
001	GEN	001	002	And the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the spirit of God was waving over the face of the waters.
001	GEN	001	003	And God said, Let there be light; and there was light.
001	GEN	001	004	And God saw the light that it was good; and God divided between the light and the darkness.
001	GEN	001	005	And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And it was evening and it was morning, the first day.
001	GEN	001	006	And God said, Let there be an expansion in the midst of the waters, and let it divide between waters and waters.
001	GEN	001	007	And God made the expansion, and divided between the waters which were under the expansion and the waters which were above the expansion: and it was so.
001	GEN	001	008	And God called the expansion Heaven. And it was evening and it was morning, the second day.
001	GEN	001	009	And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land be visible: and it was so.
001	GEN	001	010	And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters he called Seas: and God saw that it was good.
001	GEN	001	011	And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, herbs yielding seed, fruit-trees yielding fruit after their kind, in which its seed is upon the earth: and it was so.
001	GEN	001	012	And the earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees yielding fruit, in which its seed is after their kind: and God saw that it was good.
001	GEN	001	013	And it was evening and it was morning, the third day.
001	GEN	001	014	And God said, Let there be lights in the expansion of the heaven to divide between the day and the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years;
001	GEN	001	015	And let them be for lights in the expansion of the heaven, to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
001	GEN	001	016	And God made the two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night; and the stars.
001	GEN	001	017	And God set them in the expansion of the heaven to give light upon the earth,
001	GEN	001	018	And to rule by day and by night, and to divide between the light and the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
001	GEN	001	019	And it was evening and it was morning, the fourth day.
001	GEN	001	020	And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly moving creatures that have life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open expansion of the heaven.
001	GEN	001	021	And God created the great sea-monsters, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind, and every winged fowl after its kind: and God saw that it was good.
001	GEN	001	022	And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let the fowl multiply on the earth.
001	GEN	001	023	And it was evening and it was morning, the fifth day.
001	GEN	001	024	And God said, Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind, cattle, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth after their kind: and it was so.
001	GEN	001	025	And God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after its kind: and God saw that it was good.
001	GEN	001	026	And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and they shall have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heaven, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
001	GEN	001	027	And God created man in his image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
001	GEN	001	028	And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heaven, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
001	GEN	001	029	And God said, Behold I have given unto you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree on which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food.
001	GEN	001	030	And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the heaven, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, [I have given] every green herb for food: and it was so.
001	GEN	001	031	And God saw every thing that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And it was evening and it was morning, the sixth day.
001	GEN	002	001	Thus were finished the heavens and the earth, and all their host.
001	GEN	002	002	And God had finished on the seventh day his work which he had made, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
001	GEN	002	003	And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it; because thereon he had rested from all his work which God had created in making it.
001	GEN	002	004	These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, on the day that the Lord God made earth and heaven.
001	GEN	002	005	And every plant of the field was not yet on the earth, and every herb of the field had not yet grown; for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and man was not yet there to till the ground.
001	GEN	002	006	But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
001	GEN	002	007	And the Lord God formed the man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and the man became a living being.
001	GEN	002	008	And the Lord God planted a garden in Eden to the eastward, and he put there the man whom he had formed.
001	GEN	002	009	And the Lord God caused to grow out of the ground every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food; and the tree of life in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
001	GEN	002	010	And a river went out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it was parted, and became four principal streams.
001	GEN	002	011	The name of the first is Pishon, the same which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.
001	GEN	002	012	And the gold of that land is good; there is the bdellium and the onyx stone.
001	GEN	002	013	And the name of the second river is Gihon, the same which compasseth the whole land of Cush.
001	GEN	002	014	And the name of the third river is Hiddekel, the same which floweth towards the east of Assyria; and the fourth river is the Euphrates.
001	GEN	002	015	And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden, to till it, and to keep it.
001	GEN	002	016	And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat;
001	GEN	002	017	But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for on the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.
001	GEN	002	018	And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help suitable for him.
001	GEN	002	019	And the Lord God had formed out of the ground every beast of the field, and every fowl of the heaven, and he brought them unto the man to see what he would call them; and whatsoever the man would call every living creature, that should be its name.
001	GEN	002	020	And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the heaven, and to every beast of the field; but for man there was not found a help suitable for him.
001	GEN	002	021	And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof.
001	GEN	002	022	And the Lord God formed the rib which he had taken from the man into a woman, and brought her unto the man.
001	GEN	002	023	And the man said, This time it is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; this shall be called Woman, [Ishah,] because out of Man [Ishi] was this one taken.
001	GEN	002	024	Therefore doth a man leave his father and his mother, and cleave unto his wife, and they become one flesh.
001	GEN	002	025	And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
001	GEN	003	001	Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made; and he said unto the woman, Hath God indeed said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
001	GEN	003	002	And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden;
001	GEN	003	003	But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
001	GEN	003	004	And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye will surely not die;
001	GEN	003	005	For God doth know, that, on the day ye eat thereof, your eyes will be opened, and ye will be as God, knowing good and evil.
001	GEN	003	006	And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and the tree was desirable to make one wise, she took of its fruit, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat.
001	GEN	003	007	And the eyes of both of them were opened, and they felt that they were naked; and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
001	GEN	003	008	And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day; and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
001	GEN	003	009	And the Lord God called unto the man, and said unto him, Where art thou?
001	GEN	003	010	And he said, Thy voice I heard in the garden; and I was afraid, because I am naked; and I hid myself.
001	GEN	003	011	And he said, Who told thee that thou art naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
001	GEN	003	012	And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
001	GEN	003	013	And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
001	GEN	003	014	And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, be thou cursed above all the cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
001	GEN	003	015	And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; he shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt wound his heel.
001	GEN	003	016	Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy pain and [the suffering of] thy conception; in pain shalt thou bring forth children; and for thy husband shall be thy desire, but he shall rule over thee.
001	GEN	003	017	And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it; cursed be the ground for thy sake; in pain shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life.
001	GEN	003	018	And thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herbs of the field.
001	GEN	003	019	In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground, for out of it wast thou taken; for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
001	GEN	003	020	And the man called his wife's name Eve [Chavvah]; because she was the mother of all living [Chay].
001	GEN	003	021	And the Lord God made unto Adam and to his wife coats of skins, and clothed them.
001	GEN	003	022	And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever—
001	GEN	003	023	Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.
001	GEN	003	024	So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden the Cherubim, and the flaming sword which revolveth, to guard the way to the tree of life.
001	GEN	004	001	And the man knew Eve his wife: and she conceived, and bore Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the Lord.
001	GEN	004	002	And she bore again, his brother, Abel; and Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
001	GEN	004	003	And it came to pass in process of time, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground and offering unto the Lord.
001	GEN	004	004	And Abel—he also brought of the firstlings of his flock, and of the fattest thereof; and the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering;
001	GEN	004	005	But unto Cain and to his offering he had no respect; and it was very displeasing to Cain, and his countenance fell.
001	GEN	004	006	And the Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?
001	GEN	004	007	If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door; and unto thee is its desire, but thou canst rule over it.
001	GEN	004	008	And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.
001	GEN	004	009	And the Lord said unto Cain, Where is Abel they brother? and he said, I know not; am I my brother's keeper?
001	GEN	004	010	And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.
001	GEN	004	011	And now be thou cursed from the ground, which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand:
001	GEN	004	012	When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield its strength unto thee; fugitive and vagabond shalt thou be on the earth.
001	GEN	004	013	And Cain said unto the Lord, My punishment is greater than I can bear.
001	GEN	004	014	Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the ground; and from thy face shall I be hid; and if I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond on the earth, it will come to pass, that every one that findeth me will slay me.
001	GEN	004	015	And the Lord said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him seven-fold. And the Lord set a sign unto Cain, that any one finding him should not kill him.
001	GEN	004	016	And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.
001	GEN	004	017	And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived, and bore Enoch; and he built a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch.
001	GEN	004	018	And unto Enoch was born Irad; and Irad begat Mechujael: and Mechujael begat Methushael; and Methushael begat Lemech.
001	GEN	004	019	And Lemech took unto himself two wives, the name of one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
001	GEN	004	020	And Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and have cattle.
001	GEN	004	021	And his brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all such as play on the harp and guitar.
001	GEN	004	022	And Zillah, she also bore Tubal-cain, an artificer in every article of copper and iron; and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.
001	GEN	004	023	And Lemech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; ye wives of Lemech, hearken unto my speech; for I have slain a man to my own wounding, and a young-man to my hurt.
001	GEN	004	024	If Cain shall be avenged seven-fold, truly Lemech seventy and seven-fold.
001	GEN	004	025	And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son, and called his name Sheth [Seth]; for God [said she] hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.
001	GEN	004	026	And to Sheth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh: then began men to call upon the name of the Lord.
001	GEN	005	001	This is the book of the generations of Adam. On the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him:
001	GEN	005	002	Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, on the day when they were created.
001	GEN	005	003	And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his likeness, after his image; and called his name Sheth.
001	GEN	005	004	And the days of Adam after he had begotten Sheth were eight hundred years; and he begat sons and daughters.
001	GEN	005	005	And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years; and he died.
001	GEN	005	006	And Sheth lived a hundred and five years, and begat Enosh.
001	GEN	005	007	And Sheth lived after he had begotten Enosh eight hundred and seven years; and he begat sons and daughters.
001	GEN	005	008	And all the days of Sheth were nine hundred and twelve years; and he died.
001	GEN	005	009	And Enosh lived ninety years, and begat Kenan.
001	GEN	005	010	And Enosh lived after he had begotten Kenan eight hundred and fifteen years; and he begat sons and daughters.
001	GEN	005	011	And all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years; and he died.
001	GEN	005	012	And Kenan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalalel.
001	GEN	005	013	And Kenan lived after he had begotten Mahalalel eight hundred and forty years; and he begat sons and daughters
001	GEN	005	014	And all the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten years; and he died.
001	GEN	005	015	And Mahalalel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared.
001	GEN	005	016	And Mahalalel lived after he had begotten Jared eight hundred and thirty years; and he begat sons and daughters.
001	GEN	005	017	And all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred ninety and five years; and he died.
001	GEN	005	018	And Jared lived a hundred sixty and two years, and begat Enoch.
001	GEN	005	019	And Jared lived after he had begotten Enoch eight hundred years; and he begat sons and daughters.
001	GEN	005	020	And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years; and he died.
001	GEN	005	021	And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methushelah.
001	GEN	005	022	And Enoch walked with God after he had begotten Methushelah three hundred years; and begat sons and daughters.
001	GEN	005	023	And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years.
001	GEN	005	024	And Enoch walked with God, and he was no more; for God had taken him.
001	GEN	005	025	And Methushelah lived a hundred eighty and seven years and begat Lemech.
001	GEN	005	026	And Methushelah lived after he had begotten Lemech seven hundred eighty and two years; and he begat sons and daughters.
001	GEN	005	027	And all the days of Methushelah were nine hundred sixty and nine years; and he died.
001	GEN	005	028	And Lemech lived a hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son.
001	GEN	005	029	And he called his name Noach, [Noah,] saying, This one shall comfort us concerning our work and the toil of our hands, because of the ground which the Lord hath cursed.
001	GEN	005	030	And Lemech lived after he had begotten Noah five hundred ninety and five years; and begat sons and daughters.
001	GEN	005	031	And all the days of Lemech were seven hundred seventy and seven years; and he died.
001	GEN	005	032	And Noah was five hundred years old, and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
001	GEN	006	001	And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
001	GEN	006	002	That the sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they were fair; and they took themselves wives of all whom they chose.
001	GEN	006	003	And the Lord said, My Spirit shall not always strive for the sake of man, for that he is but flesh; yet his days [of grace] shall be a hundred and twenty years.
001	GEN	006	004	The giants were on the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bore children to them; these became the mighty men, who were of old the men of renown.
001	GEN	006	005	And God saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
001	GEN	006	006	And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
001	GEN	006	007	And the Lord said, I will destroy the man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man and beast, and the creeping things and the fowls of the heaven; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
001	GEN	006	008	But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.
001	GEN	006	009	These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just, perfect man in his generation; Noah walked with God.
001	GEN	006	010	And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
001	GEN	006	011	And the earth was corrupt before God; and the earth was filled with violence.
001	GEN	006	012	And God looked upon the earth, and behold, it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
001	GEN	006	013	And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them, and I will destroy them with the earth.
001	GEN	006	014	Make thee an ark of gopher-wood, rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
001	GEN	006	015	And this is the manner in which thou shalt make it: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
001	GEN	006	016	A window shalt thou make to the ark, and thou shalt finish it above, to be one cubit broad, and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
001	GEN	006	017	And as regards myself, behold, I will bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under the heavens; every thing that is on the earth shall perish.
001	GEN	006	018	But I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
001	GEN	006	019	And of every living thing, of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee: male and female shall they be.
001	GEN	006	020	Of the fowls after their kind, and of the cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after its kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
001	GEN	006	021	And thou, for thy part, take unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be unto thee, and unto them for food.
001	GEN	006	022	Thus did Noah; according to all that God had commanded him, so he did.
001	GEN	007	001	And the Lord said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy household into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.
001	GEN	007	002	Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee seven pairs of each, the male and his female; and of beasts that are not clean two, the male and his female.
001	GEN	007	003	Also of the fowls of the heaven, seven pairs of each, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.
001	GEN	007	004	For after only seven days more, I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights: and I will blot out every living substance that I have made from off the face of the earth.
001	GEN	007	005	And Noah did all just as the Lord had commanded him.
001	GEN	007	006	And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.
001	GEN	007	007	And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
001	GEN	007	008	Of the clean beasts, and of the beasts that are not clean, and of the fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,
001	GEN	007	009	One pair of each went in unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah.
001	GEN	007	010	And it came to pass, after the seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.
001	GEN	007	011	In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on this same day, were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.
001	GEN	007	012	And the rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
001	GEN	007	013	On that self-same day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;
001	GEN	007	014	They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after its kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird, every thing that hath wings.
001	GEN	007	015	And they went in unto Noah into the ark, one pair of each, of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life.
001	GEN	007	016	And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and then the Lord shut him in.
001	GEN	007	017	And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bore up the ark, and it was lifted up above the earth.
001	GEN	007	018	And the waters prevailed, and increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark floated along upon the face of the waters.
001	GEN	007	019	And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high mountains that are under the whole heavens were covered.
001	GEN	007	020	Fifteen cubits above them did the waters prevail; and the mountains were [thus] covered.
001	GEN	007	021	And all flesh perished that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man.
001	GEN	007	022	All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that were on the dry land, died.
001	GEN	007	023	And it swept off every living substance which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and creeping things, and fowls of the heaven; and they were swept from the earth; and Noah only was left, together with those that were with him in the ark.
001	GEN	007	024	And the waters prevailed upon the earth one hundred and fifty days.
001	GEN	008	001	And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that were with him in the ark: and God caused a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters were assuaged;
001	GEN	008	002	The fountains also of the deep, and the windows of heaven were stopped; and the rain from heaven was restrained.
001	GEN	008	003	And the waters returned from off the earth, gradually returning; and the waters were abated after the end of the hundred and fifty days.
001	GEN	008	004	And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.
001	GEN	008	005	And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen;
001	GEN	008	006	And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made;
001	GEN	008	007	And he sent forth a raven which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.
001	GEN	008	008	He then sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground.
001	GEN	008	009	But the dove found no resting-place for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him unto the ark; for there was water on the face of the whole earth; then he put forth his hand, and took her, and brought her into the ark.
001	GEN	008	010	And he stayed yet another seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark.
001	GEN	008	011	And the dove came in to him at the time of the evening; and, lo, an olive-leaf plucked off was in her mouth; so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
001	GEN	008	012	And he stayed yet other seven days, and sent forth the dove; but she returned not again unto him any more.
001	GEN	008	013	And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, that the waters were dried up from off the earth; and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
001	GEN	008	014	And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth perfectly dried up.
001	GEN	008	015	And God spoke unto Noah, saying,
001	GEN	008	016	Go forth from the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.
001	GEN	008	017	Every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, bring forth with thee; that they may breed abundantly on the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.
001	GEN	008	018	And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him.
001	GEN	008	019	Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their families, went forth out of the ark.
001	GEN	008	020	And Noah built an altar unto the Lord, and he took of every clean cattle, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt-offerings on the altar.
001	GEN	008	021	And the Lord smelled the sweet savour; and the Lord said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for the sake of man; although the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth: neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.
001	GEN	008	022	All the while the earth remaineth, seed-time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night, shall not cease.
001	GEN	009	001	And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.
001	GEN	009	002	And the fear of you, and the dread of you, shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the heaven; whatever is that moveth upon the earth, and all the fishes of the sea, are delivered into your hand.
001	GEN	009	003	Every moving thing that liveth shall be yours for food; even as the green herbs have I given you all things.
001	GEN	009	004	But flesh in which its life is, which is its blood, shall ye not eat.
001	GEN	009	005	Your blood, however, on which your lives depend, will I require: at the hand of every beast will I require it; and at the hand of man, at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
001	GEN	009	006	Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed; for in the image of God made he man.
001	GEN	009	007	And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly on the earth, and multiply thereon.
001	GEN	009	008	And God spoke unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,
001	GEN	009	009	And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;
001	GEN	009	010	And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you, from all those that go out of the ark, for every beast of the earth.
001	GEN	009	011	And I will establish my covenant with you; and all flesh shall not be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there be any more a flood to destroy the earth.
001	GEN	009	012	And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you, and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations.
001	GEN	009	013	My bow I do set in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of the covenant between me and the earth.
001	GEN	009	014	And it shall come to pass, that, when I bring a cloud over the earth, and the bow shall be seen in the cloud,
001	GEN	009	015	I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
001	GEN	009	016	And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature, of all flesh, that is upon the earth.
001	GEN	009	017	And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.
001	GEN	009	018	And the sons of Noah that went forth from the ark, were Shem, Ham and Japheth; and Ham was the father of Canaan.
001	GEN	009	019	These three were the sons of Noah, and of them was the whole earth overspread.
001	GEN	009	020	And Noah, who was a husbandman, began his work, and he planted a vineyard.
001	GEN	009	021	And he drank of the wine, and became drunken; and he uncovered himself within his tent.
001	GEN	009	022	And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told it his two brothers without.
001	GEN	009	023	And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon the shoulders of both of them, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were turned backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.
001	GEN	009	024	And Noah awoke from his wine, and discovered what his younger son had done unto him.
001	GEN	009	025	And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.
001	GEN	009	026	And he said, Blessed be the Lord, the God of Shem; and Canaan shall be a servant unto them.
001	GEN	009	027	May God enlarge the boundaries of Japheth, and may he dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be a servant unto them.
001	GEN	009	028	And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
001	GEN	009	029	And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years; and he died.
001	GEN	010	001	Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and unto them were sons born after the flood.
001	GEN	010	002	The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tirass.
001	GEN	010	003	And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.
001	GEN	010	004	And Javan's sons: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
001	GEN	010	005	From these were separated the isles of the nations in their lands, every one after his tongue: after their families, in their nations.
001	GEN	010	006	And the sons of Ham: Cush and Mizrayim, Put and Canaan.
001	GEN	010	007	And the sons of Cush: Seba and Havilah, Sabtah and Raamah, and Sabtecha; and the sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.
001	GEN	010	008	And Cush begat Nimrod; he began to be a mighty man on the earth.
001	GEN	010	009	He was a mighty hunter before the Lord: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the Lord.
001	GEN	010	010	And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
001	GEN	010	011	Out of that land went forth Asshur, and built Nineveh, and the city of Rechoboth, and Calach.
001	GEN	010	012	And Ressen between Nineveh and Calach: the same is the great city.
001	GEN	010	013	And Mizrayim begat the Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuchim.
001	GEN	010	014	And the Pethrussim, and Casluchin, [out of whom came the Pelishtim,] and the Caphtorim.
001	GEN	010	015	And Canaan begat Sidon his first-born, and Heth,
001	GEN	010	016	And the Jebusite, and the Emorite, and the Girgashite,
001	GEN	010	017	And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,
001	GEN	010	018	And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite; and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.
001	GEN	010	019	And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gazzah; as thou goest unto Sodom and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboyim, even unto Lesha.
001	GEN	010	020	These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, in their nations.
001	GEN	010	021	But unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, were children born.
001	GEN	010	022	The sons of Shem: Elam, and Asshur, and Arpachshad, and Lud, and Aram.
001	GEN	010	023	And the children of Aram: Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.
001	GEN	010	024	And Arpachshad begat Shelach; and Shelach begat Eber.
001	GEN	010	025	And unto Eber were born two sons; the name of one was Peleg, for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan.
001	GEN	010	026	And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerach,
001	GEN	010	027	And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,
001	GEN	010	028	And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba.
001	GEN	010	029	And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan.
001	GEN	010	030	And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar, the mount of the east.
001	GEN	010	031	These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.
001	GEN	010	032	These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations; and from these were the nations separated on the earth after the flood.
001	GEN	011	001	And the whole earth was of one language, and of one kind of words.
001	GEN	011	002	And it came to pass, as they journeyed toward the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they dwelt there.
001	GEN	011	003	And they said to one another, Go to, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly. And thus the brick served them for stone, and slime served them for mortar.
001	GEN	011	004	And they said, Go to, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower, the top of which may reach unto heaven; and let us make ourselves a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
001	GEN	011	005	And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of man were building.
001	GEN	011	006	And the Lord said, Behold, it is one people, and they have all one language, and this is the first thing they undertake to do; and now shall they not be restrained in all which they have imagined to do?
001	GEN	011	007	Go to, let us go down, and confound there their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.
001	GEN	011	008	So the Lord scattered them abroad from there over the face of all the earth; and they left off to build the city.
001	GEN	011	009	Therefore is the name of it called Babel, because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth; and from there did the Lord scatter them abroad over the face of all the earth.
001	GEN	011	010	These are the generations of Shem: Shem, when a hundred years old, begat Arpachshad, two years after the flood.
001	GEN	011	011	And Shem lived after he had begotten Arpachshad five hundred years; and begat sons and daughters.
001	GEN	011	012	And Arpachshad lived five and thirty years, and begat Shelach.
001	GEN	011	013	And Arpachshad lived after he had begotten Shelach four hundred and three years; and begat sons and daughters.
001	GEN	011	014	And Shelach lived thirty years, and begat Eber.
001	GEN	011	015	And Shelach lived after he had begotten Eber four hundred and three years; and begat sons and daughters.
001	GEN	011	016	And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg.
001	GEN	011	017	And Eber lived after he had begotten Peleg four hundred and thirty years; and begat sons and daughters.
001	GEN	011	018	And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu.
001	GEN	011	019	And Peleg lived after he had begotten Reu two hundred and nine years; and begat sons and daughters.
001	GEN	011	020	And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug.
001	GEN	011	021	And Reu lived after he had begotten Serug two hundred and seven years; and begat sons and daughters.
001	GEN	011	022	And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nachor.
001	GEN	011	023	And Serug lived after he had begotten Nachor two hundred years; and begat sons and daughters.
001	GEN	011	024	And Nachor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terach.
001	GEN	011	025	And Nachor lived after he had begotten Terach a hundred and nineteen years; and begat sons and daughters.
001	GEN	011	026	And Terach lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nachor, and Haran.
001	GEN	011	027	Now these are the generations of Terach: Terach begat Abram, Nachor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.
001	GEN	011	028	And Haran died before his father Terach in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.
001	GEN	011	029	And Abram and Nachor took themselves wives; the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nachor's wife was Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Yiscah.
001	GEN	011	030	But Sarai was barren; she had no child.
001	GEN	011	031	And Terach took Abram his son, and Lot, the son of Haran, his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, the wife of his son Abram; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Charan, and dwelt there.
001	GEN	011	032	And the days of Terach were two hundred and five years; and Terach died in Charan.
001	GEN	012	001	Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and out of thy birthplace, and from thy father's house, unto the land that I will show thee.
001	GEN	012	002	And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
001	GEN	012	003	And I will bless those that bless thee, and him that curseth thee, will I curse; and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
001	GEN	012	004	So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him, and Lot went with him; and Abram was seventy and five years old at his departure out of Charan.
001	GEN	012	005	And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had acquired, and the persons that they had obtained in Charan; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and they came into the land of Canaan.
001	GEN	012	006	And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh; and the Canaanite was then in the land.
001	GEN	012	007	And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land. And he built there an altar unto the Lord, who had appeared unto him.
001	GEN	012	008	And he removed from there unto the mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west, and 'Ai on the east; and he built there an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
001	GEN	012	009	And Abram journeyed farther, still going on toward the south.
001	GEN	012	010	And there arose a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
001	GEN	012	011	And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a woman of handsome appearance:
001	GEN	012	012	And it may come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they will say, This is his wife; and they may kill me, but thee they will save alive.
001	GEN	012	013	Say then, I pray thee, thou art my sister, that it may go well with me for thy sake, and my soul live because of thee.
001	GEN	012	014	And it came to pass, when Abram was come into Egypt, that the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
001	GEN	012	015	The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her to Pharaoh; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
001	GEN	012	016	And he did well to Abram for her sake; and he received sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and she-asses, and camels.
001	GEN	012	017	But the Lord plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram's wife.
001	GEN	012	018	And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this thou hast done unto me? Why didst thou not tell me that she is thy wife?
001	GEN	012	019	Why saidst thou, She is my sister? and so I took her to me for a wife; now, therefore, behold, here is thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
001	GEN	012	020	And Pharaoh commanded some men concerning him, who accompanied him and his wife, and all that he had.
001	GEN	013	001	And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.
001	GEN	013	002	And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.
001	GEN	013	003	And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth-el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth-el and 'Ai;
001	GEN	013	004	Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first; and Abram called there on the name of the Lord.
001	GEN	013	005	And Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.
001	GEN	013	006	And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together; for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
001	GEN	013	007	And there arose a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle, and the herdmen of Lot's cattle; and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.
001	GEN	013	008	And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we are near relatives.
001	GEN	013	009	Is not the whole land before thee? Separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right, then I will go to the left.
001	GEN	013	010	And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere; before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, [it was] like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, till thou comest unto Zoar.
001	GEN	013	011	Then Lot chose himself all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east; and they separated themselves the one from the other.
001	GEN	013	012	Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan; and Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tents, till close to Sodom.
001	GEN	013	013	But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly.
001	GEN	013	014	And the Lord said unto Abram, after Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thy eyes, and look from the place where thou art, northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward;
001	GEN	013	015	For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed forever.
001	GEN	013	016	And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth; so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.
001	GEN	013	017	Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for unto thee will I give it.
001	GEN	013	018	Then Abram pitched his tent, and came and dwelt in the grove of Mamre, which is in Hebron; and he built there an altar unto the Lord.
001	GEN	014	001	And it came to pass, in the day of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Kedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goyim;
001	GEN	014	002	That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboyim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
001	GEN	014	003	All these joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is now the salt sea.
001	GEN	014	004	Twelve years had they served Kedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
001	GEN	014	005	And in the fourteenth year came Kedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and they smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnayim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathayim,
001	GEN	014	006	And the Horites in their mountain Seir, unto El-paran, which is by the wilderness.
001	GEN	014	007	And they returned and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Emorites, that dwelt in Hazezon-tamar.
001	GEN	014	008	And then went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboyim, and the king of Bela, [the same is Zoar;] and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
001	GEN	014	009	With Kedorlaomer king of Elam, and with Tidal king of Goyim, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
001	GEN	014	010	And the vale of Siddim was full of slime-pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell therein; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
001	GEN	014	011	And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
001	GEN	014	012	And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
001	GEN	014	013	And there came one that had escaped, and told it to Abram the Hebrew; but he dwelt in the grove of Mamre the Emorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner, and these were confederates of Abram.
001	GEN	014	014	And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants; born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them into Dan.
001	GEN	014	015	And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
001	GEN	014	016	And he brought back all the goods; and he also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and also the women, and the people.
001	GEN	014	017	And the king of Sodom went out to meet him [after his return from smiting Kedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him] at the valley of Shaveh, which is the kings' dale.
001	GEN	014	018	And Malkizidek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine; and he was a priest of the most high God.
001	GEN	014	019	And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth.
001	GEN	014	020	And blessed he the most high God, who hath delivered thy enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
001	GEN	014	021	And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and the goods take to thyself.
001	GEN	014	022	And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted up my hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
001	GEN	014	023	That I will not take from a thread even to a shoe-latchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine; lest thou shouldst say, I have made Abram rich:
001	GEN	014	024	Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre — these may take their portion.
001	GEN	015	001	After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not Abram; I am thy shield, thy reward shall be exceedingly great.
001	GEN	015	002	And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?
001	GEN	015	003	And Abram said, Behold to me thou hast given no seed; and lo, one born in my house will be my heir.
001	GEN	015	004	And behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This one shall not be thy heir; but he that shall come forth out of thy own bowels shall be thy heir.
001	GEN	015	005	And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward the heaven, and count the stars, if thou be able to count them; and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
001	GEN	015	006	And he believed in the Lord; and he accounted it to him for righteousness.
001	GEN	015	007	And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give unto thee this land, to inherit it.
001	GEN	015	008	And he said, Lord God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?
001	GEN	015	009	And he said unto him, Take me a heifer of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon.
001	GEN	015	010	And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one opposite the other; but the birds he did not divide.
001	GEN	015	011	And the birds of prey came down upon the carcasses; but Abram drove them away.
001	GEN	015	012	And when the sun was about going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and lo, a horror, dark and great, fell upon him.
001	GEN	015	013	And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land which is not theirs, and they will make them serve, and they will afflict them four hundred years.
001	GEN	015	014	And also that nation whom they shall serve, will I judge; and afterward shall they go out with great substance.
001	GEN	015	015	But thou shalt come to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
001	GEN	015	016	Yet the fourth generation shall come hither again; for the iniquity of the Emorites will not be full until then.
001	GEN	015	017	And it came to pass, when the sun had gone down, and it was dark, that behold a smoking furnace, and a burning flame, which passed between those pieces.
001	GEN	015	018	On the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates;
001	GEN	015	019	The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,
001	GEN	015	020	And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaim,
001	GEN	015	021	And the Emorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.
001	GEN	016	001	Now Sarai, Abram's wife, bore him no children; and she had an Egyptian handmaid, whose name was Hagar.
001	GEN	016	002	And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing: go in, I pray thee, unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.
001	GEN	016	003	And Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar, the Egyptian, her maid, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.
001	GEN	016	004	And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived; and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress became of little esteem in her eyes.
001	GEN	016	005	And Sarai said unto Abram, I suffer wrong through thee; I have placed my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I became of little esteem in her eyes; may the Lord judge between me and thee.
001	GEN	016	006	But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face.
001	GEN	016	007	And an angel of the Lord found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain on the way to Shur.
001	GEN	016	008	And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, From the face of my mistress Sarai I am fleeing.
001	GEN	016	009	And the angel of the Lord said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.
001	GEN	016	010	And the angel of the Lord said unto her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.
001	GEN	016	011	And the angel of the Lord said unto her, Behold, thou art with child, and wilt bear a son, and thou shalt call his name Ishmael; because the Lord hath heard thy affliction.
001	GEN	016	012	And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and in the presence of all his brethren shall he dwell.
001	GEN	016	013	And she called the name of the Lord that spoke unto her, Thou art an all-seeing God; for she said, Have I not also seen here a vision after he appeared to me?
001	GEN	016	014	Wherefore the well was called Beerlachai-roi: behold, it is between Kadesh and Bared.
001	GEN	016	015	And Hagar bore Abram a son; and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.
001	GEN	016	016	And Abram was eighty and six years old, when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.
001	GEN	017	001	And when Abram was ninety and nine years old, the Lord appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God: walk before me, and be thou perfect.
001	GEN	017	002	And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and I will multiply thee exceedingly.
001	GEN	017	003	And Abram fell on his face, and God spoke with him, saying,
001	GEN	017	004	As for me, behold my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt become the father of a multitude of nations.
001	GEN	017	005	Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for the father of a multitude of nations have I made thee.
001	GEN	017	006	And I will make thee exceedingly fruitful, and I will cause thee to become nations; and kings shall come out of thee.
001	GEN	017	007	And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and between thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant: to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
001	GEN	017	008	And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou sojournest, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.
001	GEN	017	009	And God said unto Abraham, But thou, for thy part, shalt keep my covenant, thou and thy seed after thee, in their generations.
001	GEN	017	010	This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and between you, and between thy seed after thee: Every man-child among you shall be circumcised.
001	GEN	017	011	And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and this shall serve as the token of the covenant between me and you.
001	GEN	017	012	And at eight days old shall every man-child in your generations be circumcised among you, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, who is not of thy seed.
001	GEN	017	013	He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised; and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
001	GEN	017	014	And any uncircumcised male, who circumciseth not the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
001	GEN	017	015	And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.
001	GEN	017	016	And I will bless her, and give thee also a son of her; yea I will bless her, and she shall become a mother of nations; kings of people shall spring from her.
001	GEN	017	017	Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed; and he said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old? and shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear?
001	GEN	017	018	And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!
001	GEN	017	019	And God said, Truly, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son; and thou shalt call his name Isaac; and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, for his seed after him.
001	GEN	017	020	And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make of him a great nation.
001	GEN	017	021	But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.
001	GEN	017	022	And when he had left off talking with him, God went up from Abraham.
001	GEN	017	023	And Abraham now took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskin on the selfsame day, as God had spoken unto him.
001	GEN	017	024	And Abraham was ninety and nine years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
001	GEN	017	025	And Ishmael his son, was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
001	GEN	017	026	On the self-same day was Abraham circumcised, with Ishmael his son.
001	GEN	017	027	And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.
001	GEN	018	001	And the Lord appeared unto him in the grove of Mamre; while he was sitting at the door of the tent in the heat of the day.
001	GEN	018	002	And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and lo, three men stood near him; and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the door of the tent, and bowed himself to the ground;
001	GEN	018	003	And he said, My Lord, if now I have found favor in thy eyes, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant.
001	GEN	018	004	Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree.
001	GEN	018	005	And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your heart, after that ye may pass on; since ye have once passed by your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast spoken.
001	GEN	018	006	And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.
001	GEN	018	007	And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man, and he hastened to dress it.
001	GEN	018	008	And he took cream and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
001	GEN	018	009	And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife! And he said, Behold, in the tent.
001	GEN	018	010	And he said, I will certainly return unto thee at this time next year: and lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it at the door of the tent, which was behind him.
001	GEN	018	011	Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in years; it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.
001	GEN	018	012	Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord also being old!
001	GEN	018	013	And the Lord said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, since I am old?
001	GEN	018	014	Is anything too hard for the Lord? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, at this time next year, and Sarah shall have a son.
001	GEN	018	015	Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid; but he said, Nay; indeed thou didst laugh.
001	GEN	018	016	And the men rose up from there and looked toward Sodom; and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.
001	GEN	018	017	And the Lord said, Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about doing?
001	GEN	018	018	Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
001	GEN	018	019	For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, that they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do righteousness and justice; in order that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken concerning him.
001	GEN	018	020	And the Lord said, Because the cry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous:
001	GEN	018	021	I will go down now, and see if they have done according to the cry against them, which is come unto me, destruction [shall come upon them]; and if not, I will know it.
001	GEN	018	022	And the men turned their faces from there, and went toward Sodom; but Abraham stood yet before the Lord.
001	GEN	018	023	And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou then destroy the righteous also with the wicked?
001	GEN	018	024	Peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city; wilt thou then also destroy and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous that are therein?
001	GEN	018	025	Far be it from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, and that the righteous should be as the wicked; far be this from thee; shall the Judge of all the earth not exercise justice?
001	GEN	018	026	And the Lord said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then will I spare all of the place for their sake.
001	GEN	018	027	And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, although I am but dust and ashes:
001	GEN	018	028	Peradventure there will lack five of the fifty righteous; wilt thou then destroy all the city for the [lack of] these five? And he said, I will not destroy, if I find there forty and five.
001	GEN	018	029	And he spoke yet again unto him, and said, Peradventure there will be found there forty. And he said, I will not do it for the sake of the forty.
001	GEN	018	030	And he said, Oh, let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there will be found there thirty. And he said, I will not do it, if I find there thirty.
001	GEN	018	031	And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there will be found there twenty. And he said, I will not destroy for the sake of the twenty.
001	GEN	018	032	And he said, Oh, let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure there will be found there ten. And he said, I will not destroy, for the sake of the ten.
001	GEN	018	033	And the Lord went away, when he had finished speaking with Abraham; and Abraham returned unto his place.
001	GEN	019	001	And the two angels came to Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom; and when Lot saw them he rose up to meet them, and he bowed himself with his face to the ground.
001	GEN	019	002	And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye can rise up early, and go on your way. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
001	GEN	019	003	And he pressed upon them greatly, and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they did eat.
001	GEN	019	004	But before they had lain down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
001	GEN	019	005	And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men who came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
001	GEN	019	006	And Lot went out unto them, at the entrance [of the house], and shut the door after him.
001	GEN	019	007	And he said, I pray you, my brethren, do not act wickedly.
001	GEN	019	008	Behold now, I have two daughters who have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes, only unto these men do nothing, since they have once come under the shadow of my roof.
001	GEN	019	009	And they said, Stand back. And they said, This one man came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge; now will we deal worse with thee than with them. And they pressed sorely upon the man Lot, and they came near to break the door.
001	GEN	019	010	But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot to them into the house, and the door they locked.
001	GEN	019	011	And the men that were at the entrance of the house they smote with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the entrance.
001	GEN	019	012	And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? a son-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring out of this place.
001	GEN	019	013	For we will destroy this place, because the cry against them is waxed great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.
001	GEN	019	014	And Lot went out and spoke unto his sons-in-law, who were to marry his daughters, and said, Arise, get yourselves out of this place, for the Lord will destroy this city; but he seemed as one that jesteth in the eyes of his sons-in-law.
001	GEN	019	015	And as the morning dawn arose, the angels urged Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters that are here, lest thou be consumed for the iniquity of the city.
001	GEN	019	016	And while he yet lingered, the men laid hold of his hand, and of the hand of his wife, and of the hand of his two daughters, because the Lord desired to spare him; and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
001	GEN	019	017	And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life, look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
001	GEN	019	018	And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my lord!
001	GEN	019	019	Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy eyes, and thou hast magnified thy kindness, which thou hast showed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest the evil overtake me, and I die.
001	GEN	019	020	Behold now, this city is near to flee thereunto, and it is little; oh, let me, I pray thee, escape thither, [as it is but little,] that my life may be saved.
001	GEN	019	021	And he said unto him, See, I have favored thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, of which thou hast spoken.
001	GEN	019	022	Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou hast come thither. Therefore was the name of the city called Zoar.
001	GEN	019	023	The sun rose over the earth, when Lot entered into Zoar.
001	GEN	019	024	And the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire, from the Lord, out of heaven;
001	GEN	019	025	And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
001	GEN	019	026	But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
001	GEN	019	027	And Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the Lord:
001	GEN	019	028	And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and lo, smoke went up from the earth as the smoke of a furnace.
001	GEN	019	029	And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot away out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot had dwelt.
001	GEN	019	030	And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him, for he feared to dwell in Zoar; and he dwelt in a cave, he, and his two daughters.
001	GEN	019	031	And the first-born said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the country to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
001	GEN	019	032	Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
001	GEN	019	033	And they made their father drink wine that night; and the first-born went in, and lay with her father, and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
001	GEN	019	034	And it came to pass on the morrow, that the first-born said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father; let us make him drink wine this night also, and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
001	GEN	019	035	And they made their father drink wine that night also; and the younger arose, and lay with him, and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
001	GEN	019	036	And both the daughters of Lot became with child by their father.
001	GEN	019	037	And the first-born bore a son, and called his name Moab; the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
001	GEN	019	038	And the younger, she also bore a son, and called his name Ben-ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.
001	GEN	020	001	And Abraham journeyed from there toward the south country, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur and sojourned in Gerar.
001	GEN	020	002	And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister; and Abimelech the king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.
001	GEN	020	003	But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou shalt die for the sake of the woman whom thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife.
001	GEN	020	004	But Abimelech had not come near to her; and he said, Lord, wilt thou then slay also a righteous nation?
001	GEN	020	005	Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself, said, He is my brother; in the integrity of my heart and the innocency of my hands have I done this.
001	GEN	020	006	And God said unto him in the dream, Yea, I also well know that thou hast done this in the integrity of thy heart; therefore did I also withhold thee from sinning against me; for this cause I suffered thee not to touch her.
001	GEN	020	007	And now restore the man's wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for thee, that thou mayest live; and if thou restore her not, know thou, that thou shalt surety die, thou and all that are thine.
001	GEN	020	008	And Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their hearing; and the men were greatly afraid.
001	GEN	020	009	Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and in what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? deeds that ought not to be done thou hast done unto me.
001	GEN	020	010	And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou didst this thing?
001	GEN	020	011	And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely there is no fear of God in this place, and they will slay me for the sake of my wife.
001	GEN	020	012	And yet indeed she is my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
001	GEN	020	013	And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt show unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
001	GEN	020	014	And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and men-servants, and women-servants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored to him Sarah his wife.
001	GEN	020	015	And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it is pleasing in thy eyes.
001	GEN	020	016	And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, this is to thee a covering of the eyes unto all that are with thee; and with all others thou canst thus justify thyself.
001	GEN	020	017	And Abraham prayed unto God; and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maid-servants, so that they could bear children.
001	GEN	020	018	For the Lord had fast closed up every womb of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.
001	GEN	021	001	And the Lord visited Sarah as he had said, and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken.
001	GEN	021	002	And Sarah conceived, and bore unto Abraham a son in his old age, at the appointed time of which God had spoken to him.
001	GEN	021	003	And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.
001	GEN	021	004	And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac, at eight days old, as God had commanded him.
001	GEN	021	005	And Abraham was a hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.
001	GEN	021	006	And Sarah said, God hath made me joy, whoever heareth it will laugh concerning me.
001	GEN	021	007	And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarai should have given children suck? yet I have born a son in his old age.
001	GEN	021	008	And the child grew, and was weaned; and Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.
001	GEN	021	009	And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had born unto Abraham, mocking.
001	GEN	021	010	Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bond-woman and her son; for the son of this bond-woman shall not be heir with my son, with Isaac.
001	GEN	021	011	And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's eyes, because of his son.
001	GEN	021	012	And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy eyes because of the lad, and because of thy bond-woman; in all that Sarah may say unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
001	GEN	021	013	And also of the son of the bond-woman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.
001	GEN	021	014	And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it onto her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away; and she departed, and wandered astray in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.
001	GEN	021	015	And the water was spent from the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.
001	GEN	021	016	And she went, and seated herself down at some distance, a good way off, about a bow-shot; for she said, I cannot look on when the child dieth; so she sat at a distance, and lifted up her voice, and wept.
001	GEN	021	017	And God heard the voice of the lad; and an angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? Fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad, there where he is.
001	GEN	021	018	Arise, lift up the lad, and lay hold on him with thy hand; for I will make of him a great nation.
001	GEN	021	019	And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water: and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
001	GEN	021	020	And God was with the lad; and he grew up, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.
001	GEN	021	021	And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran; and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
001	GEN	021	022	And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, spoke unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
001	GEN	021	023	Now therefore swear unto me here by God, that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son; [but] according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, shalt thou do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.
001	GEN	021	024	And Abraham said, I will swear.
001	GEN	021	025	And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.
001	GEN	021	026	And Abimelech said, I know not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me; nor have I heard of it except this day.
001	GEN	021	027	And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.
001	GEN	021	028	And Abraham set seven ewe-lambs of the flock, by themselves.
001	GEN	021	029	And Abimelech said unto Abraham; What mean these seven ewe-lambs which thou hast set by themselves?
001	GEN	021	030	And he said, For these seven ewe-lambs shalt thou take from my hand, that they may be a witness unto me that I have dug this well.
001	GEN	021	031	Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba; because there they swore, both of them.
001	GEN	021	032	Thus they made a covenant at Beer-sheba; then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.
001	GEN	021	033	And Abraham planted an orchard in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the Lord, the God of everlasting.
001	GEN	021	034	And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.
001	GEN	022	001	And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and he said unto him, Abraham, and he said, Behold, here am I.
001	GEN	022	002	And he said: Take now thy son, thy only one, whom thou lovest, even Isaac, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I tell thee of.
001	GEN	022	003	And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son; and he clave the wood for the burnt-offering, and arose, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
001	GEN	022	004	On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.
001	GEN	022	005	And Abraham said unto his young men, abide ye here with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder, and we will worship, and then come again to you.
001	GEN	022	006	And Abraham took the wood for the burnt-offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took in his hand the fire and the knife; and they went both of them together.
001	GEN	022	007	And Isaac spoke unto Abraham his father, and said, My father; and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold, here is the fire and the wood; but where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?
001	GEN	022	008	And Abraham said, God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt-offering, my son; so they went both of them together.
001	GEN	022	009	And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built there an altar, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar above the wood.
001	GEN	022	010	And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.
001	GEN	022	011	But the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham; and he said, Here am I.
001	GEN	022	012	And he said, Lay not thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou the least unto him; for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing that thou hast not withheld thy son, thy only one, from me.
001	GEN	022	013	And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, there was a ram that was afterward caught in a thicket by his horns; and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt-offering in the stead of his son.
001	GEN	022	014	And Abraham called the name of that place, Adonai-yireh: as it is said to this day, On the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
001	GEN	022	015	And the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham the second time out of heaven,
001	GEN	022	016	And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, since, because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thy only one:
001	GEN	022	017	That I will greatly bless thee, and I will exceedingly multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the seashore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
001	GEN	022	018	And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because that thou hast obeyed my voice.
001	GEN	022	019	And Abraham returned unto his young men; and they rose up, and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt in Beer-sheba.
001	GEN	022	020	And it came to pass after these things, that it was told to Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she also, hath born children unto Nachor thy brother;
001	GEN	022	021	'Uz his first born, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,
001	GEN	022	022	And Kesed, and Chazo, and Pildash, and Yidlaph, and Bethuel.
001	GEN	022	023	And Bethuel begat Rebekah; these eight did Milcah bear to Nachor, Abraham's brother.
001	GEN	022	024	And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she also bore Tebach, and Gacham, and Thachash, and Maachah.
001	GEN	023	001	And the lifetime of Sarah was a hundred and twenty-seven years; [these] were the years of the life of Sarah.
001	GEN	023	002	And Sarah died in Kiryath-arba, the same in Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.
001	GEN	023	003	And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spoke unto the sons of Heth, saying,
001	GEN	023	004	A stranger and a sojourner I am with you; give me a possession for a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
001	GEN	023	005	And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him:
001	GEN	023	006	Hear us, my lord; a prince of God thou art among us; in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, so that thou mayest bury thy dead.
001	GEN	023	007	And Abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the land, to the children of Heth.
001	GEN	023	008	And he spoke with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and intercede for me with Ephron the son of Zochar,
001	GEN	023	009	That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which is his, which is at the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me, for a possession as a burying-place amongst you.
001	GEN	023	010	And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth; and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the children of Heth, and of all those that went in at the gate of his city, saying,
001	GEN	023	011	Nay, my lord, hear me: the field I give to thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it to thee; in the presence of the sons of my people do I give it to thee; bury thy dead.
001	GEN	023	012	And Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land.
001	GEN	023	013	And he spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wouldst only hear me; I will give the money for the field, take it off me, and I will bury my dead there.
001	GEN	023	014	And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,
001	GEN	023	015	My lord, hearken unto me: a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that between me and thee? only bury thy dead.
001	GEN	023	016	And Abraham understood the meaning of Ephron; and Abraham weighed out to Ephron the silver which he had named in the hearing of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current with the merchant.
001	GEN	023	017	And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all its borders round about, were made sure
001	GEN	023	018	Unto Abraham for a bought possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
001	GEN	023	019	And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah, before Mamre, which is Hebron, in the land of Canaan.
001	GEN	023	020	And the field, with the cave that is therein, was made sure unto Abraham for a possession as a burying-place by the sons of Heth.

001	GEN	024	002	And Abraham said unto his servant, the eldest of his house, who ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:
001	GEN	024	003	And I will make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell.
001	GEN	024	004	But unto my country, and to my birthplace shalt thou go, and take a wife unto my son, unto Isaac.
001	GEN	024	005	And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I then bring thy son again unto the land from which thou camest?
001	GEN	024	006	And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou, that thou bring not my son thither again.
001	GEN	024	007	The Lord, the God of heaven, who took me from my father's house, and from the land of my birth, and who spoke unto me, and who swore unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land: he will send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from there.
001	GEN	024	008	But if the woman should not be willing to follow thee, then shalt, thou be clear from this my oath: only my son thou shalt not bring thither again.
001	GEN	024	009	And the put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter.
001	GEN	024	010	And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed, with all kinds of precious things of his master in his hand; and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nachor.
001	GEN	024	011	And he made the camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, at the time that the women go out to draw water.
001	GEN	024	012	And he said, O Lord, the God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and deal kindly with my master Abraham.
001	GEN	024	013	Behold, I stand by the well of water: and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water.
001	GEN	024	014	And let it come to pass that the maiden to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and to thy camels also will I give drink, be the one thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shown kindness unto my master.
001	GEN	024	015	And it came to pass, before he had yet finished speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, the son of Milcah, the wife of Nachor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.
001	GEN	024	016	And the maiden was of a very handsome appearance, a virgin, neither had any man known her; and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.
001	GEN	024	017	And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water out of thy pitcher.
001	GEN	024	018	And she said, Drink, my lord; and she hastened, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him to drink.
001	GEN	024	019	And when she had finished giving him drink, she said, Also for thy camels will I draw water, until they have finished drinking.
001	GEN	024	020	And she hastened, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.
001	GEN	024	021	And the man was wondering at her; remaining silent, to discover whether the Lord had made his journey prosperous or not.
001	GEN	024	022	And it came to pass, as the camels had finished drinking, that the man took a golden earring, half a shekel in weight, and two bracelets for her hands, ten gold shekels in weight;
001	GEN	024	023	And he said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee; is there room in thy father's house for us to stay this night in?
001	GEN	024	024	And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore unto Nachor.
001	GEN	024	025	She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender in plenty, as also room to lodge in.
001	GEN	024	026	And the man bowed down his head, and prostrated himself before the Lord.
001	GEN	024	027	And he said, Blessed be the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, who hath not withdrawn his mercy and his truth from my master; I being on the way, which the Lord hath led me, to the house of the brethren of my master.
001	GEN	024	028	And the maiden ran, and told at her mother's house these things.

001	GEN	024	031	And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the Lord; wherefore standest thou without? while I have prepared the house and room for the camels.
001	GEN	024	032	And the man came into the house, and he ungirded the camels; and he gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the feet of the men that were with him.
001	GEN	024	033	And there was set food before him to eat; but he said, I will not eat, until I have spoken my words. And he said, Speak on.
001	GEN	024	034	And he said, I am Abraham's servant.
001	GEN	024	035	And the Lord hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and camels, and asses.

001	GEN	024	038	But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son.
001	GEN	024	039	And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.
001	GEN	024	040	And he said unto me, The Lord, before whom I have walked will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; that thou mayest take a wife for my son from my kindred, and from my father's house.
001	GEN	024	041	Then shalt thou be clear from my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they do not give thee one, [then] shalt thou be clear from my oath.
001	GEN	024	042	And I came this day unto the well, and said, O Lord, the God of my master Abraham, if thou wouldst but prosper my way on which I am going.
001	GEN	024	043	Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall be the young woman who cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water out of thy pitcher to drink;
001	GEN	024	044	And she say to me, Both drink thou, and also for thy camels will I draw: this shall be the wife whom the Lord hath destined for my master's son.
001	GEN	024	045	And before I had yet finished speaking to my own heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew water; and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.
001	GEN	024	046	And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and also to thy camels I will give drink; and I drank, and she made the camels drink also.
001	GEN	024	047	And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nachor's son, whom Milcah bore unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.
001	GEN	024	048	And I bowed down my head, and prostrated myself before the Lord; and I blessed the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take the daughter of my master's brother for his son.
001	GEN	024	049	And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me, that I may turn to the right, or to the left.
001	GEN	024	050	Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing hath proceeded from the Lord; we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.
001	GEN	024	051	Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be the wife of thy master's son, as the Lord hath spoken.

001	GEN	024	056	And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the Lord hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.
001	GEN	024	057	And they said, We will call the maiden, and inquire her own decision.
001	GEN	024	058	And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.

001	GEN	024	065	And she said unto the servant, Who is yonder man that walketh in the field toward us? And the servant said, This is my master; therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.

001	GEN	025	010	The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, with Sarah his wife.
001	GEN	025	011	And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lachai-roi.
001	GEN	025	012	Now theses are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bore unto Abraham.
001	GEN	025	013	And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the first-born of Ishmael, Nebayoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,
001	GEN	025	014	And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,
001	GEN	025	015	Chadad, and Tema, Yetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.
001	GEN	025	016	These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
001	GEN	025	017	And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, one hundred and thirty and seven years: and he departed this life and died; and was gathered unto his people.
001	GEN	025	018	And they dwelt from Chavilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: he dwelt in the presence of all his brethren.
001	GEN	025	019	And these are the generations of Isaac, the son of Abraham: Abraham begat Isaac.
001	GEN	025	020	And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian, of Padan-aram, the sister to Laban the Syrian, to himself as wife.
001	GEN	025	021	And Isaac entreated the Lord in behalf of his wife, because she was barren: and the Lord was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
001	GEN	025	022	And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why did I desire this? And she went to inquire of the Lord.
001	GEN	025	023	And the Lord said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.
001	GEN	025	024	And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.
001	GEN	025	025	And the first came out red, all over like a hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.
001	GEN	025	026	And after that came his brother out, his hand holding on to Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.
001	GEN	025	027	And the boys grew up: and Esau was an expert hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.
001	GEN	025	028	And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison; but Rebekah loved Jacob.
001	GEN	025	029	And Jacob at one time boiled pottage, and Esau came from the field, and he was faint.
001	GEN	025	030	And Esau said to Jacob, Let me swallow down, I pray thee, some of that yonder red pottage, for I am faint; therefore was his name called Edom.
001	GEN	025	031	And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy right of first-born.
001	GEN	025	032	And Esau said, Behold, I am going to die; and what profit then can the right of first-born be to me?
001	GEN	025	033	And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he swore unto him, and he sold his right of first-born unto Jacob.
001	GEN	025	034	Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles, and he did eat and drink, and he rose up, and went his way; thus Esau despised the birthright.
001	GEN	026	001	And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham; and Isaac went unto Abimelech, the king of the Philistines, unto Gerar.
001	GEN	026	002	And the Lord appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of.
001	GEN	026	003	Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, will I give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I swore unto Abraham thy father;
001	GEN	026	004	And I will cause thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and I will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth bless themselves.
001	GEN	026	005	Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.
001	GEN	026	006	And Isaac dwelt in Gerar.
001	GEN	026	007	And the men of the place asked [him] concerning his wife; and he said, She is my sister; for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, [said he,] the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah, because she is of a handsome appearance.
001	GEN	026	008	And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech, the king of the Philistines, looked out at a window, and saw, and behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.
001	GEN	026	009	And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife: and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I thought, Perhaps I may die for her.
001	GEN	026	010	And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? How easily might one of the people have lain with thy wife, and thou wouldst have brought guiltiness upon us.
001	GEN	026	011	And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.
001	GEN	026	012	Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year a hundred-fold: so the Lord blessed him.
001	GEN	026	013	And the man became great, and went forward and grew, until he became very great;
001	GEN	026	014	And he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants; and the Philistines envied him.
001	GEN	026	015	And all the wells which his father's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, these the Philistines stopped, and filled them with earth.
001	GEN	026	016	And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go away from us; for thou hast become much mightier than we.
001	GEN	026	017	And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.
001	GEN	026	018	And Isaac dug again the wells of water, which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father, and which the Philistines had stopped after the death of Abraham; and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.
001	GEN	026	019	And the servants of Isaac dug in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.
001	GEN	026	020	And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Essek; because they strove with him.
001	GEN	026	021	And they dug another well, and they strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.
001	GEN	026	022	And he removed from there, and dug another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rechoboth, and he said, For now the Lord hath made room for us, and we shall increase in the land.
001	GEN	026	023	And he went up from there to Beer-sheba.
001	GEN	026	024	And the Lord appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father; fear not, for I am with thee, and I will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for the sake of Abraham my servant.
001	GEN	026	025	And he built there an altar, and called upon the name of the Lord, and pitched there his tent: and the servants of Isaac dug there a well.
001	GEN	026	026	Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Achuzzath his friend, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.
001	GEN	026	027	And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing that ye do hate me, and have sent me away from you?
001	GEN	026	028	And they said, We saw clearly that the Lord was with thee; and we said, Let there be now an oath between us and thee; and we will make a covenant with thee;
001	GEN	026	029	That thou shalt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now one blessed of the Lord.
001	GEN	026	030	And he made them a feast, and they ate and drank.
001	GEN	026	031	And they rose up betimes in the morning, and they swore one to the other; and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.
001	GEN	026	032	And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had dug, and they said unto him, We have found water.
001	GEN	026	033	And he called it Shibah: therefore is the name of the city Beer-sheba unto this day.
001	GEN	026	034	And when Esau was forty years old he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri, the Hittite, and Bahsemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite.
001	GEN	026	035	And they were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.
001	GEN	027	001	And it came to pass, when Isaac was old, and his eyes were too dim to see, that he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I.
001	GEN	027	002	And he said, Behold now, I am grown old, I know not the day of my death:
001	GEN	027	003	Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and hunt for me some venison;
001	GEN	027	004	And make me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.
001	GEN	027	005	And Rebekah heard as Isaac was speaking to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.
001	GEN	027	006	And Rebekah spoke unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,
001	GEN	027	007	Bring me venison, and make me savory food, that I may eat and bless thee before the Lord before my death.
001	GEN	027	008	And now, my son, obey my voice in that which I command thee.
001	GEN	027	009	Go, I pray thee, to the flock, and fetch me from there two good kids; and I will make them savory food for thy father, such as he loveth:
001	GEN	027	010	And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat; for the sake that he may bless thee before his death.
001	GEN	027	011	And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:
001	GEN	027	012	Peradventure my father will feel me, and I shall then seem to him as a deceiver; and I would bring upon me a curse, and not a blessing.
001	GEN	027	013	And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son; only obey my voice, and go fetch them to me.
001	GEN	027	014	And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savory food, such as his father loved.
001	GEN	027	015	And Rebekah took the goodly garments of her eldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and clothed therewith Jacob her younger son;
001	GEN	027	016	And the skins of the kids she put upon his hands, and upon the smooth part of his neck;
001	GEN	027	017	And she gave the savory food and bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of Jacob her son.
001	GEN	027	018	And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who art thou my son?
001	GEN	027	019	And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first-born; I have done as thou didst speak to me: arise I pray thee, sit here and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.
001	GEN	027	020	And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the Lord thy God brought it before me.
001	GEN	027	021	And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be truly my son Esau or not.
001	GEN	027	022	And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father, and he felt him; and he said, The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.
001	GEN	027	023	And he recognized him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him.
001	GEN	027	024	And he said, Art thou indeed my son Esau? and he said I am.
001	GEN	027	025	And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat, and he brought him wine, and he drank.
001	GEN	027	026	And Isaac his father said unto him, Come near, I pray thee, and kiss me, my son.
001	GEN	027	027	And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his garments and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is the smell of the field which the Lord hath blessed.
001	GEN	027	028	And may God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine;
001	GEN	027	029	Nations shall serve thee, and people bow down to thee; be lord over thy brethren, and thy mother's sons shall bow down to thee; cursed be they that curse thee, and blessed be they that bless thee.
001	GEN	027	030	And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarcely gone out from the presence of his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.
001	GEN	027	031	And he also made savory food, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, in order that thy soul may bless me.
001	GEN	027	032	And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy first-born, Esau.
001	GEN	027	033	And Isaac trembled greatly, exceedingly, and said, Who was it? where is he that had hunted venison, and brought it me, and I ate of all before thou camest, and blessed him? yea, he shall also remain blessed.
001	GEN	027	034	When Esau heard the words of his father, he uttered a great and exceedingly bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, also me, my father.
001	GEN	027	035	And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and took away thy blessing.
001	GEN	027	036	And he said, Hath he been therefore named Jacob, because he hath supplanted me these two times? my right of first-born he took away; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing: and he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me.
001	GEN	027	037	And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I endowed him: and what can I do now for thee, my son.
001	GEN	027	038	And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou then but one blessing, my father? bless me, also me, my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.
001	GEN	027	039	And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and [blessed] by the dew of heaven from above;
001	GEN	027	040	And by thy sword shalt thou live, and thy brother shalt thou serve; and it shall come to pass, that when thou shalt have the dominion, thou canst break his yoke from off thy neck.
001	GEN	027	041	And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father had blessed him; and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father will be at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.
001	GEN	027	042	And Rebekah was informed of the words of Esau her elder son: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau doth comfort himself, with regard to thee, purposing to kill thee.
001	GEN	027	043	Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother, to Charan;
001	GEN	027	044	And tarry with him a short time, until thy brother's fury turn away;
001	GEN	027	045	Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then will I send, and fetch thee from there; why should I be deprived of both of you at once in one day?
001	GEN	027	046	And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth; if Jacob take a wife from the daughters of Heth, such as these, from the daughters of the land, what good will life do me?
001	GEN	028	001	And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan.
001	GEN	028	002	Arise, go to Padan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; and take thyself from there a wife of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother.
001	GEN	028	003	And God, the Almighty, bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest become a multitude of people;
001	GEN	028	004	And may he give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land of thy sojourn, which God gave unto Abraham.
001	GEN	028	005	And Isaac sent away Jacob, and he went to Padan-aram, unto Laban, the son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.
001	GEN	028	006	And when Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padan-aram, to take himself from there a wife; and in blessing him had given him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;
001	GEN	028	007	And that Jacob had obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padan-aram:
001	GEN	028	008	Then saw Esau that the daughters of Canaan were evil in the eyes of Isaac his father;
001	GEN	028	009	And Esau went unto Ishmael, and took Machalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, the sister of Nebayoth in addition to his wives, to himself as wife.
001	GEN	028	010	And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward Charan.
001	GEN	028	011	And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took one of the stones of the place, and put it for his pillow, and laid himself down in that place.
001	GEN	028	012	And he dreamed, and behold a ladder was set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven; and behold, angels of God were ascending and descending on it.
001	GEN	028	013	And, behold, the Lord stood above it, and said, I am the Lord, the God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;
001	GEN	028	014	And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north and to the south; and in thee and thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
001	GEN	028	015	And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee whithersoever thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done what I have spoken to thee of.
001	GEN	028	016	And Jacob awakened out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the Lord is present in this place; and I knew it not.
001	GEN	028	017	And he was afraid, and said, How fearful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.
001	GEN	028	018	And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillow, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.
001	GEN	028	019	And he called the name of that place Beth-el; but Luz was the name of that city in former times.
001	GEN	028	020	And Jacob made a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me on this way which I am going, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,
001	GEN	028	021	And I come again in peace to my father's house: then shall the Lord be my God;
001	GEN	028	022	And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house; and of all that thou wilt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.
001	GEN	029	001	Then Jacob lifted up his feet and went unto the land of the children of the east.
001	GEN	029	002	And he looked, and behold there was a well in the field, and, lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and the stone upon the mouth of the well was great.
001	GEN	029	003	And there all the flocks were wont to assemble; and they rolled then the stone from the mouth of the well, and watered the sheep; and they put the stone again upon the mouth of the well in its place.
001	GEN	029	004	And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence are ye? And they said, Of Charan are we.
001	GEN	029	005	And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nachor? And they said, We know him.
001	GEN	029	006	And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well; and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.
001	GEN	029	007	And he said, Lo, the day is yet long, it is not time that the cattle should be driven home; water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.
001	GEN	029	008	And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, then do they roll the stone from the mouth of the well; and we water the sheep.
001	GEN	029	009	And while he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep; for she was a shepherdess.
001	GEN	029	010	And it came to pass when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the mouth of the well, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.
001	GEN	029	011	And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.
001	GEN	029	012	And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.
001	GEN	029	013	And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.
001	GEN	029	014	And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.
001	GEN	029	015	And Laban then said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldst thou therefore serve me for naught? tell me, what shall thy wages be?
001	GEN	029	016	And Laban had two daughters; the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.
001	GEN	029	017	And the eyes of Leah were tender; but Rachel was of handsome form and handsome appearance.
001	GEN	029	018	And Jacob loved Rachel; and he said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.
001	GEN	029	019	And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man; abide with me.
001	GEN	029	020	And Jacob served for Rachel seven years; and they seemed unto him but a few days, through the love he had to her.
001	GEN	029	021	And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.
001	GEN	029	022	And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.
001	GEN	029	023	And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.
001	GEN	029	024	And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah, Zilpah his maid for a handmaid.
001	GEN	029	025	And it came to pass that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did I not serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou deceived me?
001	GEN	029	026	And Laban said, It is not done so in our place, to give in marriage the younger before the first-born.
001	GEN	029	027	Fulfill the week of this, and we will give thee this one also, for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.
001	GEN	029	028	And Jacob did so, and fulfilled the week of the first; and he gave him Rachel his daughter for a wife.
001	GEN	029	029	And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his hand-maid to be her maid.
001	GEN	029	030	And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah; and he served with him yet seven other years.
001	GEN	029	031	And when the Lord saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb; but Rachel was barren.
001	GEN	029	032	And Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben; for she said, Surely, the Lord hath looked upon my affliction, because now my husband will love me.
001	GEN	029	033	And she conceived again and bore a son; and she said, Because the Lord heard that I was hated, he hath given me this one also; and she called his name Simeon.
001	GEN	029	034	And she conceived again, and bore a son; and she said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons; therefore was his name called Levi.
001	GEN	029	035	And she conceived again, and bore a son; and she said, This time will I praise the Lord; therefore she called his name Judah: and she left off bearing.
001	GEN	030	001	And when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and she said unto Jacob, Give me children, and if not, I die.
001	GEN	030	002	And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?
001	GEN	030	003	And she said, Behold, [here is] my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her.
001	GEN	030	004	And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid for wife, and Jacob went in unto her.
001	GEN	030	005	And Bilhah conceived, and bore Jacob a son.
001	GEN	030	006	And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan.
001	GEN	030	007	And Bilhah, Rachel's maid, conceived again, and bore Jacob a second son.
001	GEN	030	008	And Rachel said, Contests of God have I contended with my sister, I have also prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.
001	GEN	030	009	When Leah now saw that she had left off bearing, she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her to Jacob for wife.
001	GEN	030	010	And Zilpah Leah's maid bore Jacob a son.
001	GEN	030	011	And Leah said, Good luck hath come: and she called his name Gad.
001	GEN	030	012	And Zilpah Leah's maid bore a second son unto Jacob.
001	GEN	030	013	And Leah said, To my happiness; for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called his name Asher.
001	GEN	030	014	And Reuben went in the days of the wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and he brought them unto Leah his mother; then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, [some] of thy son's mandrakes.
001	GEN	030	015	And she said unto her, Is it not enough that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldst thou also take away my son's mandrakes? And Rachel said, Therefore shall he be with thee to-night for thy son's mandrakes.
001	GEN	030	016	And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Unto me thou must come in; for surely I have obtained thee as a reward with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.
001	GEN	030	017	And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son.
001	GEN	030	018	And Leah said, God hath given me my reward, because I have given my maid to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.
001	GEN	030	019	And Leah conceived again, and bore a sixth son unto Jacob.
001	GEN	030	020	And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons; and she called his name Zebulun.
001	GEN	030	021	And afterward she bore a daughter, and she called her name Dinah.
001	GEN	030	022	And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb.
001	GEN	030	023	And she conceived, and bore a son; and she said, God hath taken away my reproach.
001	GEN	030	024	And she called his name Joseph, saying, The Lord shall add to me another son.
001	GEN	030	025	And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto my own place, and to my country.
001	GEN	030	026	Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go; for thou knowest my service with which I have served thee.
001	GEN	030	027	And Laban said unto him, If I could but find favor in thy eyes; I have learned by experience that the Lord hath blessed me for thy sake:
001	GEN	030	028	And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give them.
001	GEN	030	029	And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and what thy cattle hath become with me.
001	GEN	030	030	For it was a little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased into a multitude; and the Lord hath blessed thee since my coming; and now when shall I provide also for my own house?
001	GEN	030	031	And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me the least; if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep thy flock:
001	GEN	030	032	I will pass through all thy flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted lamb, and every brown lamb among the sheep, and whatever is spotted and speckled among the goats; and such shall be after this my reward.
001	GEN	030	033	And my righteousness shall testify for me in time to come, when it shall come with my reward before thy face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.
001	GEN	030	034	And Laban said, Well, let it be according to thy word.
001	GEN	030	035	And he removed on that day the he-goats that were ring-streaked and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had some white on it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.
001	GEN	030	036	And he put a space of three days' journey between himself and Jacob; and Jacob fed the flocks of Laban that were left.
001	GEN	030	037	And Jacob took himself rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chestnut tree; and peeled thereon white streaks, laying bare the white which was on the rods.
001	GEN	030	038	And he set the rods which he had peeled in the gutters in the watering troughs, where the flocks came to drink, just before the flocks, and where they conceived, when they came to drink.
001	GEN	030	039	And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth ring-streaked, speckled, and spotted.
001	GEN	030	040	And these lambs did Jacob separate, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ring-streaked, and whatever was brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not with Laban's cattle.
001	GEN	030	041	And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.
001	GEN	030	042	But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in; so the feebler belonged to Laban, and the stronger to Jacob.
001	GEN	030	043	And the man increased exceedingly, and he had many flocks, and maid-servants, and men-servants, and camels, and asses.
001	GEN	031	001	And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's, and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this wealth.
001	GEN	031	002	And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as before.
001	GEN	031	003	And the Lord said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy birthplace; and I will be with thee.
001	GEN	031	004	And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock.
001	GEN	031	005	And he said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me.
001	GEN	031	006	And ye know well that with all my power I have served your father.
001	GEN	031	007	And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times: but God suffered him not to do me evil.
001	GEN	031	008	If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages: then bore all the flocks speckled: and if he said thus, The ring-streaked shall be thy reward; then bore all the flocks ring-streaked.
001	GEN	031	009	Thus God took away the cattle of your father, and gave them to me.
001	GEN	031	010	And it came to pass at the time that the flocks conceived, that I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the flocks were ring-streaked, speckled, and grizzled.
001	GEN	031	011	And an angel of God spoke unto me in the dream, Jacob: and I said, Here am I.
001	GEN	031	012	And he said, Lift up now thy eyes and see, all the rams which leap upon the flocks are ring-streaked, speckled, and grizzled; for I have seen all that Laban doth unto thee.
001	GEN	031	013	I am the God of Beth-el, where thou anointedst a pillar, where thou madest unto me a vow: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy birth.
001	GEN	031	014	And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?
001	GEN	031	015	Were we not counted of him as strangers? for he hath sold us; and he hath quite consumed also our money.
001	GEN	031	016	For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours, and our children's; now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.
001	GEN	031	017	Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;
001	GEN	031	018	And he led away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his acquiring, which he had gotten in Padan-aram, to go to Isaac his father into the land of Canaan.
001	GEN	031	019	And Laban was gone to shear his sheep; and Rachel stole the images that were her father's.
001	GEN	031	020	And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, by not letting him know that he was going to flee.
001	GEN	031	021	And he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.
001	GEN	031	022	And it was told to Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.
001	GEN	031	023	And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him a seven days' journey; and he overtook him at the mount of Gilead.
001	GEN	031	024	And God came to Laban, the Syrian, in a dream of the night, and said unto him, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
001	GEN	031	025	Then Laban overtook Jacob; now Jacob had pitched his tent on the mount, and Laban with his brethren pitched on the mount of Gilead.
001	GEN	031	026	And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and led away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword.
001	GEN	031	027	Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and why didst thou not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?
001	GEN	031	028	And [why] hast thou not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? now thou hast acted foolishly in so doing.
001	GEN	031	029	It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt; but the God of your father spoke unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
001	GEN	031	030	And now, thou wouldst needs be gone, because thou greatly longedst after thy father's house; [yet] wherefore hast thou stolen my gods.
001	GEN	031	031	And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid, for I said, Peradventure thou wouldst take by force thy daughters from me.
001	GEN	031	032	With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live; before our brethren seek out thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee; but Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.
001	GEN	031	033	And Laban went into the tent of Jacob, and into the tent of Leah, and into the tent of the two maid-servants; but he found nothing; he then went out of the tent of Leah, and entered into Rachel's tent.
001	GEN	031	034	Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the saddle-cushion of the camel, and sat upon them; and Laban searched all the tent, and found nothing.
001	GEN	031	035	And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me; and thus he searched, but found not the images.
001	GEN	031	036	Now Jacob became wroth, and quarrelled with Laban; and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?
001	GEN	031	037	Although thou hast searched all my goods, what hast thou found of all the articles of thy household? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge between us both.
001	GEN	031	038	These twenty years have I been with thee: thy ewes and thy she-goats have not cast their young; and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.
001	GEN	031	039	That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I had to bear the loss of it, of my hand didst thou require it, whatever was stolen by day, or stolen by night.
001	GEN	031	040	[Where] I was in the day the heat consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from my eyes.
001	GEN	031	041	These twenty years have I been in thy house; I have served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy flocks: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.
001	GEN	031	042	Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst now sent me away empty; my affliction and the labor of my hands God hath seen, and decided yesternight.
001	GEN	031	043	And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, and the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that thou seest is mine; but as to my daughters, what can I do unto them this day, or unto their children whom they have born?
001	GEN	031	044	And now, come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.
001	GEN	031	045	And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.
001	GEN	031	046	And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made a heap; and they ate there upon the heap.
001	GEN	031	047	And Laban called it Yegar-sahadutha; but Jacob called it Galed.
001	GEN	031	048	And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day; therefore called he its name Galed;
001	GEN	031	049	And Mitzpah; for he said, The Lord shall watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from the other;
001	GEN	031	050	If thou shouldst afflict my daughters, or if thou shouldst take other wives besides my daughters, when there is no man with us: see, God is witness between me and thee.
001	GEN	031	051	And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast up between me and thee;
001	GEN	031	052	Witness be this heap and witness be this pillar, that I will not pass by this heap, and that thou shalt not pass unto me by this heap and this pillar, for evil.
001	GEN	031	053	The God of Abraham and the God of Nachor shall judge between us, the God of their father; but Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac.
001	GEN	031	054	Then Jacob slew some cattle upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread; and they did eat bread, and tarried all night on the mount.
001	GEN	031	055	And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters and blessed them; and Laban departed, and returned unto his own place.
001	GEN	032	001	And Jacob went on his way, and there met him angels of God.
001	GEN	032	002	And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is a host of God; and he called the name of that place Machanayim.
001	GEN	032	003	And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom.
001	GEN	032	004	And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord, to Esau, Thus hath said thy servant Jacob, With Laban have I sojourned, and stayed until now.
001	GEN	032	005	And I have acquired oxen, and asses, flocks, and men-servants, and women-servants; and I send now to tell my lord, to find grace in thy eyes.
001	GEN	032	006	And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother, to Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.
001	GEN	032	007	Then Jacob was greatly afraid, and he felt distressed; and he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two bands.
001	GEN	032	008	And he said, If Esau should come to the one band and smite it, then the other band which is left may escape.
001	GEN	032	009	And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the Lord who saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy birthplace, and I will deal well with thee:
001	GEN	032	010	I am not worthy of all the kindness, and of all the truth, which thou hast shown unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.
001	GEN	032	011	Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, the mother with the children.
001	GEN	032	012	And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.
001	GEN	032	013	And he lodged there that same night; and he took of that which he carried with him a present for Esau his brother:
001	GEN	032	014	Two hundred she-goats, and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams.
001	GEN	032	015	Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty cows, and ten bulls, twenty she-asses, and ten foals.
001	GEN	032	016	And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself; and he said unto his servants, Pass on before me, and put a space between drove and drove.
001	GEN	032	017	And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother should meet thee, and ask thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither art thou going? and for whom are these before thee?
001	GEN	032	018	Then shalt thou say, They belong to thy servant, to Jacob; it is a present sent unto my lord, to Esau; and, behold, also, he is himself behind us.
001	GEN	032	019	And so he commanded also the second, also the third, as also all that followed the droves, saying, After this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.
001	GEN	032	020	And say ye moreover, Behold, also thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will receive me kindly.
001	GEN	032	021	The present went thus on before him; and he lodged himself that night in the camp.
001	GEN	032	022	And he rose up that night, and he took his two wives, and his two women-servants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford of the Yabbok.
001	GEN	032	023	And he took them, and sent them over the stream and sent over what he had.
001	GEN	032	024	And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.
001	GEN	032	025	And when he saw that he could net prevail against him, he struck against the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was put out of joint, as he was wrestling with him.
001	GEN	032	026	And he said, Let me go, for the day hath dawned. And he said, I will not let thee go until thou hast blessed me.
001	GEN	032	027	And he said unto him, What is thy name? and he said, Jacob.
001	GEN	032	028	And he said, Not Jacob shall any more be called thy name, but Israel; for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.
001	GEN	032	029	And Jacob asked him, and said, tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.
001	GEN	032	030	And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen an angel of God face to face, and my life hath been preserved.
001	GEN	032	031	And the sun rose unto him as he passed by Penuel, and he halted upon his thigh.
001	GEN	032	032	Therefore do the children of Israel not eat the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day; because he struck against the hollow of Jacob's thigh on the sinew that shrank.
001	GEN	033	001	And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.
001	GEN	033	002	And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.
001	GEN	033	003	And he himself passed on before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.
001	GEN	033	004	And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him; and they wept.
001	GEN	033	005	And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are these with thee? And he said, The children whom God hath graciously given thy servant.
001	GEN	033	006	Then came the handmaids near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.
001	GEN	033	007	And Leah also with her children came near, and they bowed themselves; and after that came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.
001	GEN	033	008	And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I have met? And he said, To find grace in the eyes of my lord.
001	GEN	033	009	And Esau said, I have enough, my brother, keep unto thyself what thou hast.
001	GEN	033	010	And Jacob said, This must not be, I pray thee; if I have but found grace in thy eyes, then do thou receive my present at my hand; since I have seen thy face, it is as though I had seen the face of an angel, and because thou hast received me kindly.
001	GEN	033	011	Take, I pray thee, my present that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have a plenty of all. And he urged him, and he took it.
001	GEN	033	012	And he said, Let us depart, and move farther, and I will travel near thee.
001	GEN	033	013	And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are a charge on me: and if they should overdrive them one day, all the flock would die.
001	GEN	033	014	Let my lord, I pray thee, pass on before his servant: and I will lead on slowly, according to the cattle that goeth before me and the children may be able to travel, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.
001	GEN	033	015	And Esau said, Let me, I pray thee, leave with thee some of the people that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me only final grace in the eyes of my lord.
001	GEN	033	016	So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.
001	GEN	033	017	And Jacob journeyed to Succoth and built himself a house, and for his cattle he made booths; therefore he called the name of the place Succoth.
001	GEN	033	018	And Jacob came in good health to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padan-aram; and he encamped before the city.
001	GEN	033	019	And he bought the parcel of the field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Chamor, the father of Shechem, for a hundred kessitah.
001	GEN	033	020	And he erected there an altar, and called it, El-Elohe-Yisrael.
001	GEN	034	001	And Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she had born unto Jacob, went out to look about among the daughters of the land.
001	GEN	034	002	And Shechem the son of Chamor the Hivite, the prince of the country, saw her; and he took her, and lay with her, and did her violence.
001	GEN	034	003	And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the maiden, and spoke kindly unto the maiden.
001	GEN	034	004	And Shechem spoke unto Chamor his father, saying, Get me this girl for wife.
001	GEN	034	005	And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter; but his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come.
001	GEN	034	006	And Chamor the father of Shechem went out unto to Jacob to speak with him.
001	GEN	034	007	And the sons of Jacob came from the field when they heard it, and the men were grieved, and it excited their anger greatly; because he had wrought a disgraceful thing in Israel to lie with the daughter of Jacob, and this ought not to be done.
001	GEN	034	008	And Chamor spoke with them, saying, The soul of Shechem my son longeth for your daughter; give her, I pray you, unto him for wife.
001	GEN	034	009	And intermarry with us; your daughters ye shall give unto us, and our daughters ye may take unto yourselves.
001	GEN	034	010	And with us shall ye dwell; and the land shall be open before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and acquire possessions therein.
001	GEN	034	011	And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brother, Let me but find grace in your eyes, and whatever ye may say unto me, I will give.
001	GEN	034	012	Ask of me ever so much dowry and gift, and I will give, just as ye may say unto me; but give me the maiden for wife.
001	GEN	034	013	And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Chamor his father with cunning, and spoke; because he had defiled Dinah their sister.
001	GEN	034	014	And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that would be a reproach unto us.
001	GEN	034	015	But on this condition will we consent unto you; if ye will become as we are, that every male of you be circumcised:
001	GEN	034	016	Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters unto us; and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.
001	GEN	034	017	But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised, then will we take our daughter, and go our way.
001	GEN	034	018	And their words were pleasing in the eyes of Chamor, and in the eyes of Shechem, the son of Chamor.
001	GEN	034	019	And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter; and he was the most honored of all the house of his father.
001	GEN	034	020	And Chamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and spoke with the men of their city, saying,
001	GEN	034	021	These men are peaceably inclined with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; and the land, behold, it is large enough on all sides before them; their daughters we will take unto us for wives, and our daughters we will give unto them.
001	GEN	034	022	Only with this condition will the men consent unto us to dwell with us, to become one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.
001	GEN	034	023	Their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs will they not be ours? only let us consent unto them, that they may dwell with us.
001	GEN	034	024	And unto Chamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and all the males were circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.
001	GEN	034	025	And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, took each his sword, and came upon the city unresisted and slew all the males.
001	GEN	034	026	And they slew Chamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword; and they took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.
001	GEN	034	027	The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister.
001	GEN	034	028	They took their sheep and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field.
001	GEN	034	029	And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives they took captive, and spoiled; and all that was in the house.
001	GEN	034	030	And Jacob said unto Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me, to cause me to be hated among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and as I am but few in number, they may gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I would be destroyed, I and my house.
001	GEN	034	031	And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with a harlot?
001	GEN	035	001	And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Beth-el, and dwell there; and make there an altar unto the God that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.
001	GEN	035	002	Then said Jacob unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and cleanse yourselves, and change your garments.
001	GEN	035	003	And let us arise, and go up to Beth-el: and I will make there an altar unto the God who answered me on the day of my distress, and was with me on the way which I went.
001	GEN	035	004	And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and the earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was near Shechem.
001	GEN	035	005	And they journeyed; and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.
001	GEN	035	006	So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Beth-el, he and all the people that were with him.
001	GEN	035	007	And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.

001	GEN	035	010	And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob; thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.
001	GEN	035	011	And God said unto him, I am God the Almighty; be fruitful and multiply; a nation and an assemblage of nations shall spring from thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins.
001	GEN	035	012	And the land which I gave to Abraham and to Isaac, to thee will I give it; and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.

001	GEN	035	017	And it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; for this child also is a son for thee.
001	GEN	035	018	And it came to pass, as her soul was departing, [for she died] that she called his name Ben-oni; but his father called him Benjamin.
001	GEN	035	019	And so Rachel died, and was buried on the way to Ephrath, which is Beth-lechem.
001	GEN	035	020	And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: this is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day.
001	GEN	035	021	And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of flocks [Eder].
001	GEN	035	022	And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine; and Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve.

001	GEN	036	007	For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land of their sojourning could not bear them, because of their cattle.
001	GEN	036	008	Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.

001	GEN	037	001	And Jacob dwelt in the land of his father's sojourning, in the land of Canaan.
001	GEN	037	002	These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brothers; and he was as a lad with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives; and Joseph brought evil reports of them unto his father.
001	GEN	037	003	Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age; and he made him a coat of many colors.
001	GEN	037	004	And when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.
001	GEN	037	005	And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brothers: and they hated him yet the more.
001	GEN	037	006	And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed.
001	GEN	037	007	And, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also remained standing upright; and, behold, your sheaves placed themselves round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.
001	GEN	037	008	And his brothers said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.
001	GEN	037	009	And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brothers; and he said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars made obeisance to me.
001	GEN	037	010	And he told it to his father, and to his brothers; and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall we indeed come, I and thy mother, and thy brothers, to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth.
001	GEN	037	011	And his brothers envied him; but his father noted the matter [in his mind].
001	GEN	037	012	And his brothers went to feed their father's flocks in Shechem.
001	GEN	037	013	And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brothers feed [the flocks] in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I.
001	GEN	037	014	And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brothers, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him from the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
001	GEN	037	015	And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering astray in the field; and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?
001	GEN	037	016	And he said, I seek my brothers; tell me, I pray thee, where they are feeding their flocks?
001	GEN	037	017	And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brothers, and found them in Dothan.
001	GEN	037	018	And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.
001	GEN	037	019	And they said one to another, Behold, here comes this man of dreams.
001	GEN	037	020	And now, come and let us slay him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.
001	GEN	037	021	And when Reuben heard it, he delivered him out of their hand; and he said, Let us not put him to death.
001	GEN	037	022	And Reuben said unto them, Do not shed blood; but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but do not lay hand upon him; —in order that he might deliver him out of their hand, to bring him back again to his father.
001	GEN	037	023	And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brothers, that they stript Joseph of his coat, the coat of many colors that was on him;
001	GEN	037	024	And they took him, and cast him into the pit; and the pit was empty; there was no water in it.
001	GEN	037	025	And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead; and their camels were bearing spicery, and balm, and lotus, going to carry it down to Egypt.
001	GEN	037	026	And Judah said unto his brothers, What profit will it be if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?
001	GEN	037	027	Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, but let our hand not be upon him; for he is our brother, our flesh. And his brothers hearkened to him.
001	GEN	037	028	And when the Midianitish men, merchants, passed by, they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.
001	GEN	037	029	And when Reuben returned unto the pit, and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit, he rent his clothes.
001	GEN	037	030	And he returned unto his brothers, and said, The child is not there; and I, whither shall I go?
001	GEN	037	031	And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a he-goat, and dipped the coat in the blood;
001	GEN	037	032	And they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father, and said, This have we found: acknowledge, we pray thee, whether it be thy son's coat or not.
001	GEN	037	033	And he recognized it, and said, it is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is surely torn in pieces.
001	GEN	037	034	And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.
001	GEN	037	035	And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I must go down unto my son, mourning, into the grave; thus his father wept for him.
001	GEN	037	036	And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the guards.
001	GEN	038	001	And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brothers, and he pitched his tent with a certain Adullamite whose name was Chirah.
001	GEN	038	002	And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shua; and he took her, and went in unto her.
001	GEN	038	003	And she conceived, and bore a son; and he called his name 'Er.
001	GEN	038	004	And she conceived again, and bore a son; and she called his name Onan.
001	GEN	038	005	And she again bore another son; and she called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bore him.
001	GEN	038	006	And Judah took a wife for 'Er his first-born, whose name was Tamar.
001	GEN	038	007	And 'Er, Judah's first-born, was displeasing in the eyes of the Lord; and the Lord slew him.
001	GEN	038	008	And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and take her, as her brother-in-law, and raise up seed to thy brother.
001	GEN	038	009	Onan thus knew that the seed should not be his, and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, so as not to give seed unto his brother.
001	GEN	038	010	And the thing which he did was displeasing in the eyes of the Lord: wherefore he slew him also.
001	GEN	038	011	Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown; for he thought, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brothers have done. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.
001	GEN	038	012	And many days had elapsed when the daughter of Shua, Judah's wife, died; and after Judah was comforted, he went up unto his sheep-shearers, he and his friend Chirah the Adullamite, to Timnah.
001	GEN	038	013	And it was told unto Tamar, saying, Behold, thy father-in-law goeth up to Timnah to shear his sheep.
001	GEN	038	014	And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered herself with a vail, and concealed her face, and seated herself at the cross-road, which is by the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him for wife.
001	GEN	038	015	And Judah saw her and thought her to be a harlot; because she had covered her face.
001	GEN	038	016	And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; [for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law.] And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?
001	GEN	038	017	And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she said, If thou wilt give me a pledge, till thou send it.
001	GEN	038	018	And he said, What is the pledge which I shall give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy scarf, and thy staff that is in thy hand. And he gave them unto her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.
001	GEN	038	019	And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.
001	GEN	038	020	And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to take the pledge out of the woman's hand; but he found her not.
001	GEN	038	021	Then he asked the men of her place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was at the cross-road on the highway? And they said, There hath been no harlot in this neighborhood.
001	GEN	038	022	And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place have said, There hath been no harlot in this place.
001	GEN	038	023	And Judah said, Let her keep it, lest we be put to shame; behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.
001	GEN	038	024	And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told to Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by prostitution. And Judah said, Lead her forth, and let her be burnt.
001	GEN	038	025	When she was led forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Acknowledge, I pray thee, to whom belong these, the signet, the scarf, and staff.
001	GEN	038	026	And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her not again any more.
001	GEN	038	027	And it came to pass at the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb.
001	GEN	038	028	And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.
001	GEN	038	029	And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold his brother came out; and she said, How hast thou broken forth! this breach is upon thee: therefore his name was called Perez.
001	GEN	038	030	And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zerach.
001	GEN	039	001	And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the guards, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmaelites, who had brought him down thither.
001	GEN	039	002	And the Lord was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was thus in the house of his master the Egyptian.
001	GEN	039	003	And when his master saw that the Lord was with him, and that the Lord caused all that he did to prosper in his hand:
001	GEN	039	004	Joseph found grace in his eyes, and he served him; and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.
001	GEN	039	005	And it came to pass from the time he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the Lord blessed the Egyptian's house for the sake of Joseph; and the blessing of the Lord was upon all that he had, in the house and in the field.
001	GEN	039	006	And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he troubled himself not about aught he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was handsome in form and handsome in appearance.
001	GEN	039	007	And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.
001	GEN	039	008	But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, Thy master troubleth himself not about what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath into my hand;
001	GEN	039	009	There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great evil, and sin against God?
001	GEN	039	010	And it came to pass, as she spoke to Joseph day by day, and he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her;
001	GEN	039	011	That it came to pass one particular day, that he went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within.
001	GEN	039	012	And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me; and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and ran out into the street.
001	GEN	039	013	And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,
001	GEN	039	014	That she called unto the men of her house, and spoke unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in unto us a Hebrew man to have his sport with us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:
001	GEN	039	015	And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and ran out into the street.
001	GEN	039	016	And she laid up his garment by her until his lord came home.
001	GEN	039	017	And she spoke unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant whom thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to have his sport with me.
001	GEN	039	018	And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled forth.
001	GEN	039	019	And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke unto him, saying, After this manner hath thy servant done to me; that his wrath was kindled.
001	GEN	039	020	And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the king's prisoners were imprisoned: and he was there in the prison.
001	GEN	039	021	But the Lord was with Joseph, and caused him to find kindness, and gave him favor in the eyes of the superintendent of the prison.
001	GEN	039	022	And the superintendent of the prison committed into Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, was done through him.
001	GEN	039	023	The superintendent of the prison looked not after the least that was under his hand, because the Lord was with him; and that which he did, the Lord made to prosper.
001	GEN	040	001	And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and the baker committed an offense, against their lord the king of Egypt.
001	GEN	040	002	And Pharaoh was wroth against his two officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.
001	GEN	040	003	And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guards, into the prison, the place where Joseph was confined.
001	GEN	040	004	And the captain of the guards charged Joseph with them, and he served them; and they continued a season in ward.
001	GEN	040	005	And they dreamed a dream, both of them, each his dream in one night, each in accordance with the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison.
001	GEN	040	006	And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked at them, and, behold, they were sad.
001	GEN	040	007	And he asked the officers of Pharaoh that were with him in ward in his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly today?
001	GEN	040	008	And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is none to interpret it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell it to me, I pray you.
001	GEN	040	009	The chief of the butlers then told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;
001	GEN	040	010	And on the vine were three branches; and it was as though it budded, shot forth its blossoms, and on its clusters the grapes became ripe:
001	GEN	040	011	And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them out into Pharaoh's cup, and I placed the cup into Pharaoh's hand.
001	GEN	040	012	And Joseph said unto him, This is its interpretation: The three branches are three days;
001	GEN	040	013	Within yet three days will Pharaoh lift up thy head, and restore thee unto thy office; and thou shalt place Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.
001	GEN	040	014	Therefore if thou thinkest on me when it shall be well with thee, then show kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house;
001	GEN	040	015	For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews; and here also have I not done the least that they should put me into the dungeon.
001	GEN	040	016	And when the chief of the bakers saw that he had well interpreted, he said unto Joseph, I also [saw] in my dream, and, behold, I had three baskets with fine bread on my head:
001	GEN	040	017	And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats, used as food for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket from my head.
001	GEN	040	018	And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation: The three baskets are three days;
001	GEN	040	019	Within yet three days will Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and will hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.
001	GEN	040	020	And it came to pass on the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief of the butlers and the head of the chief of the bakers among his servants.
001	GEN	040	021	And he restored the chief of the butlers unto his butlership; and he placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand;
001	GEN	040	022	But the chief of the bakers he hanged, as Joseph had interpreted to them.
001	GEN	040	023	Yet the chief of the butlers did not remember Joseph, and forgot him.
001	GEN	041	001	And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.
001	GEN	041	002	And, behold, there came up out of the river seven cows, of good appearance and fat in flesh; and they fed in the meadow.
001	GEN	041	003	And, behold, seven other cows came up after them out of the river, ill-favored and lean in flesh; and they stood by the other cows upon the brink of the river.
001	GEN	041	004	And the ill-favored and lean-fleshed cows did eat up the seven well-favored and fat cows. And Pharaoh awoke.
001	GEN	041	005	And he slept and dreamed a second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up on one stalk, rank and good.
001	GEN	041	006	And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.
001	GEN	041	007	And the seven thin ears swallowed up the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.
001	GEN	041	008	And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret the same unto Pharaoh.
001	GEN	041	009	Then spoke the chief of the butlers unto Pharaoh, saying, My faults I must call to remembrance this day:
001	GEN	041	010	Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the house of the captain of the guards, me and the chief of the bakers;
001	GEN	041	011	And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each in accordance with the interpretation of his dream.
001	GEN	041	012	And there was with us a Hebrew lad, a servant to the captain of the guards; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each according to his dream did he interpret.
001	GEN	041	013	And it came to pass, just as he had interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto my office, and him he hanged.
001	GEN	041	014	Then Pharaoh sent and had Joseph called, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his garments, and came in unto Pharaoh.
001	GEN	041	015	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.
001	GEN	041	016	And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me; God will give an answer for the peace of Pharaoh.
001	GEN	041	017	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the brink of the river;
001	GEN	041	018	And, behold, there came up out of the river seven cows, fat in flesh and good in shape; and they fed in the meadow;
001	GEN	041	019	And, behold, seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ill-shaped and lean in flesh; I never saw any like these in all the land of Egypt for ugliness;
001	GEN	041	020	And the lean and the ill-favored cows did eat up the first seven fat cows;
001	GEN	041	021	And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but their appearance was still as bad as at the beginning. And I awoke.
001	GEN	041	022	And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up on one stalk, full and good;
001	GEN	041	023	And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them;
001	GEN	041	024	And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto the magicians; but there was none that could tell it to me.
001	GEN	041	025	And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, the dream of Pharaoh is one, that which God is about to do, he hath told to Pharaoh.
001	GEN	041	026	The seven good cows are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years; the dream is one.
001	GEN	041	027	And the seven thin and ill-favored cows that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears, blasted with the east wind, shall be seven years of famine.
001	GEN	041	028	This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to do he hath shown unto Pharaoh.
001	GEN	041	029	Behold, there are coming seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:
001	GEN	041	030	And there shall arise seven years of famine after them, when all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;
001	GEN	041	031	And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following it; for it shall be very grievous.
001	GEN	041	032	And as it respecteth that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice, it is because the thing is firmly resolved on by God, and God hasteneth to bring it to pass.
001	GEN	041	033	Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.
001	GEN	041	034	Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part [of the produce] of the land of Egypt in the seven years of plenty.
001	GEN	041	035	And let them gather up all the food of those good years that are coming, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, as food in the cities, and keep the same.
001	GEN	041	036	And that food shall be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land be not cut off through the famine.
001	GEN	041	037	And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.
001	GEN	041	038	And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom the spirit of God is?
001	GEN	041	039	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Inasmuch as God hath caused thee to know all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou:
001	GEN	041	040	Thou shalt be over my house, and according to thy word shall all my people be ruled, only in regard to the throne will I be greater than thou.
001	GEN	041	041	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.
001	GEN	041	042	And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a golden chain about his neck;
001	GEN	041	043	And he caused him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bend the knee: and he placed him [thus] over all the land of Egypt.
001	GEN	041	044	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh; but without thee shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.
001	GEN	041	045	And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphenath-pa'neach; and he gave him Assenath the daughter of Poti-phera', the priest of On, for wife. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.
001	GEN	041	046	And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh the king of Egypt; and Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.
001	GEN	041	047	And the earth brought forth in the seven years of plenty by handfuls.
001	GEN	041	048	And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field of the city, which was round about it, laid he up in the same.
001	GEN	041	049	And Joseph heaped up corn as the sand of the sea, very much; until he left off numbering, for it was without number.
001	GEN	041	050	And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, whom Assenath the daughter of Poti-phera' the priest of On, bore unto him.
001	GEN	041	051	And Joseph called the name of the first-born Menasseh: For God [said he] hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.
001	GEN	041	052	And the name of the second he called Ephraim; For God [said he] hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.
001	GEN	041	053	And the seven years of plenty, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.
001	GEN	041	054	And the seven years of famine began to come, just as Joseph had said; and there was famine in all the countries, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
001	GEN	041	055	And when all the land of Egypt also felt hunger, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.
001	GEN	041	056	And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the store-houses, wherein corn was, and sold unto the Egyptians; for the famine grew strong in the land of Egypt.
001	GEN	041	057	And all the countries came into Egypt to buy corn of Joseph; because the famine was sore in all the countries.
001	GEN	042	001	And when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look at one another?
001	GEN	042	002	And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt; get you down thither, and buy for us provision from there, that we may live, and not die.
001	GEN	042	003	And ten brothers of Joseph went down to buy corn in Egypt,
001	GEN	042	004	But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brothers; for he said, Lest mischief befall him.
001	GEN	042	005	And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came; for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
001	GEN	042	006	And Joseph—he was the governor over the land, it was he that sold corn to all the people of the land; and Joseph's brothers came, and bowed themselves down before him with the face to the earth.
001	GEN	042	007	And Joseph saw his brothers, and he recognized them; but made himself strange unto them and spoke roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.
001	GEN	042	008	And Joseph recognized his brothers, but they recognized not him.
001	GEN	042	009	And Joseph remembered the dreams which he had dreamed concerning them, and he said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land are ye come.
001	GEN	042	010	And they said unto him, No, my lord, thy servants are only come to buy food.
001	GEN	042	011	We are all sons of one man; we are true men; thy servants have never been spies.
001	GEN	042	012	And he said unto them, No! but to see the nakedness of the land are ye come.
001	GEN	042	013	And they said, We, thy servants, are twelve brothers, sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is no more.
001	GEN	042	014	And Joseph said unto them, It is as I have spoken unto you, saying, Ye are spies;
001	GEN	042	015	Hereby shall ye be proved: By the life of Pharaoh, ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.
001	GEN	042	016	Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether the truth be with you; and if not, by the life of Pharaoh, ye are surely spies.
001	GEN	042	017	And he put them together into ward three days.
001	GEN	042	018	And Joseph said unto them on the third day, This do, and live; I fear God.
001	GEN	042	019	If ye be true men, let one of your brothers remain imprisoned in the house of your confinement; but ye, go, carry home what you have bought for the want of your household.
001	GEN	042	020	But your youngest brother bring unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.
001	GEN	042	021	And they said to one another, Truly we are guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.
001	GEN	042	022	And Reuben answered them, saying, Did I not say unto you, thus, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? and behold, his blood also is now required.
001	GEN	042	023	And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spoke unto them by an interpreter.
001	GEN	042	024	And he turned himself away from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and spoke with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.
001	GEN	042	025	And Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way; and he did unto them thus.
001	GEN	042	026	And they loaded their asses with their corn, and departed thence.
001	GEN	042	027	And one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn: when he espied his money, for, behold, it was in the mouth of his sack.
001	GEN	042	028	And he said unto his brothers, My money hath been restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?
001	GEN	042	029	And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and they told him all that had befallen them; saying,
001	GEN	042	030	The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly to us, and took us as though we were espying the country.
001	GEN	042	031	And we said unto him, We are true men; we have never been spies:
001	GEN	042	032	We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; the one is no more, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.
001	GEN	042	033	And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men: leave one of your brothers here with me, and [the food for] the want of your households take ye and be gone;
001	GEN	042	034	And bring your youngest brother unto me; then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men; your brother I will give up to you, and in the land ye shall be allowed to traffic.
001	GEN	042	035	And it came to pass as they were emptying their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when they saw the bundles of their money, they and their father, they were afraid.
001	GEN	042	036	And Jacob their father said unto them, Me ye have bereaved of my children: Joseph is gone, and Simeon is gone, and Benjamin ye will take away; all these things are against me.
001	GEN	042	037	And Reuben said unto his father, thus, Two of my sons shalt thou slay, if I bring him not to thee; deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him back to thee.
001	GEN	042	038	And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he alone is left: and if mischief befall him by the way in which ye go, then will ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
001	GEN	043	001	And the famine was sore in the land.
001	GEN	043	002	And it came to pass, when they had completely eaten up the provisions which they had brought out of Egypt, that their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.
001	GEN	043	003	And Judah said unto him, thus, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.
001	GEN	043	004	If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food;
001	GEN	043	005	But if thou sendest him not, we will not go down; for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.
001	GEN	043	006	And Israel said, Wherefore have ye dealt so ill with me, as to tell the man that ye have yet another brother?
001	GEN	043	007	And they said, The man inquired particularly concerning us, and our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we possibly know that he would say, Bring down your brother?
001	GEN	043	008	And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, as also our little ones.
001	GEN	043	009	I will be surety for him; from my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then shall I have sinned against thee all the days.
001	GEN	043	010	For, if we had not lingered, surely we had now returned the second time.
001	GEN	043	011	And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do this: take of the best products of the land in your vessels, and carry down to the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices and lotus, pistachio-nuts and almonds;
001	GEN	043	012	And twofold money take in your hand; and the money that was put back in the mouth of your sacks, you must carry back in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight;
001	GEN	043	013	Also your brother take along, and arise, go again unto the man.
001	GEN	043	014	And may God the Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away to you your other brother, and Benjamin. And I, if I am to be bereaved, let me be bereaved.
001	GEN	043	015	And the men took that present; and twofold money they took in their hand, as also Benjamin; and they rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
001	GEN	043	016	And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the superintendent of his house, Bring these men into the house, and slay, and make ready; for with me shall these men dine at noon.
001	GEN	043	017	And the man did as Joseph had said; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.
001	GEN	043	018	And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house: and they said, Because of the money that came back in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, together with our asses.
001	GEN	043	019	And they came near to the man who was appointed over Joseph's house, and they spoke with him at the door of the house.
001	GEN	043	020	And they said, Pardon, my lord, we came down at the first time to buy food:
001	GEN	043	021	And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in its full weight; and we have brought it back in our hand.
001	GEN	043	022	And other money have we brought down in our hand to buy food; we know not who hath put our money in our sacks.
001	GEN	043	023	And he said, Peace be to you, fear not; your God, and the God of your father, hath given you a treasure in your sacks; your money hath come to me. And he brought Simeon out unto them.
001	GEN	043	024	And the man brought the men into Joseph's house; and he gave them water, and they washed their feet, and he gave provender to their asses.
001	GEN	043	025	And they made ready the present before Joseph came home at noon; for they had heard that they should eat bread there.
001	GEN	043	026	And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.
001	GEN	043	027	And he asked them after their welfare, and said, Is your old father well, of whom ye spoke? is he yet alive?
001	GEN	043	028	And they answered, Thy servant, our father, is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and prostrated themselves.
001	GEN	043	029	And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your youngest brother, of whom ye spoke unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.
001	GEN	043	030	And Joseph hastened away, for his affection toward his brother became enkindled, and he sought to weep; and he entered into his chamber and wept there.
001	GEN	043	031	And he washed his face, and came out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on the bread.
001	GEN	043	032	And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves; and for the Egyptians, who did eat with him, by themselves; because the Egyptians may not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.
001	GEN	043	033	And they sat before him, the first-born according to his prior birth, and the youngest according to his youth; and the men marveled one at the other.
001	GEN	043	034	And he sent portions unto them from before him; but Benjamin's portion exceeded the portions of all of them fivefold. And they drank, and were merry with him.
001	GEN	044	001	And he commanded the superintendent of his house, saying, Fill the sacks of these men with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in the mouth of his sack.
001	GEN	044	002	And my cup, the silver cup, thou shalt put in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, and the money for his corn. And he did according to the word of Joseph which he had spoken.
001	GEN	044	003	As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.
001	GEN	044	004	They were gone out of the city, not yet far off, when Joseph said unto the superintendent of his house, Up, follow after the men; and when thou hast overtaken them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye returned evil for good?
001	GEN	044	005	Is not this out of which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.
001	GEN	044	006	And he overtook them, and he spoke unto them these same words.
001	GEN	044	007	And they said unto him, Wherefore will my lord speak such words as these? God forbid that thy servants should do any thing like this.
001	GEN	044	008	Behold the money, which we found in the mouth of our sacks, we brought back unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?
001	GEN	044	009	With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, let him die; and we also will be bondmen unto thy lord.
001	GEN	044	010	And he said, Now also let it be according to your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; but ye shall be blameless.
001	GEN	044	011	And they made haste, and every one of them took down his sack to the ground, and every one opened his sack.
001	GEN	044	012	And he searched, at the eldest he began, and at the youngest he left off; and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.
001	GEN	044	013	Then they rent their clothes, and every one loaded his ass, and they returned to the city.
001	GEN	044	014	And Judah and his brothers came into Joseph's house, and he was yet there; and they fell down before him on the ground.
001	GEN	044	015	And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? knew ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?
001	GEN	044	016	And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we justify ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold we are servants unto my lord, both we, as also he in whose hand the cup was found.
001	GEN	044	017	And he said, God forbid that I should do this: the man in whose hand the cup was found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, go you up in peace unto your father.
001	GEN	044	018	Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Pardon, my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thy anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even as Pharaoh.
001	GEN	044	019	My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother.
001	GEN	044	020	And we said unto my lord, We have an old father, and a little child born in his old age; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.
001	GEN	044	021	And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set my eye upon him.
001	GEN	044	022	And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father; for if he should leave his father, he would die.
001	GEN	044	023	And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall not see my face any more.
001	GEN	044	024	And it came to pass, when we came up unto thy servant my father, that we told him the words of my lord.
001	GEN	044	025	And our father said, Go back and buy us a little food.
001	GEN	044	026	And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down; for we cannot see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us.
001	GEN	044	027	And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bore me two sons;
001	GEN	044	028	And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he hath been torn to pieces; and I have not seen him up to this time.
001	GEN	044	029	And if ye take this one also from me, and mischief befall him, ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
001	GEN	044	030	And now, when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;
001	GEN	044	031	It will come to pass, that when he seeth that the lad is not with us, he will die: and thy servants would thus bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.
001	GEN	044	032	For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then shall I have sinned against my father all the days.
001	GEN	044	033	Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad as bond-man to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brothers.
001	GEN	044	034	For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? I should perhaps be compelled to witness the evil which would come on my father.
001	GEN	045	001	Then could Joseph not refrain himself before all those that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there remained no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brothers.
001	GEN	045	002	And he raised his voice in weeping; and the Egyptians heard it, and the house of Pharaoh heard it.
001	GEN	045	003	And Joseph said unto his brothers, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brothers could not answer him; for they were terrified at his presence.
001	GEN	045	004	And Joseph said unto his brothers, Come near to me, I pray you; and they came near; and he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.
001	GEN	045	005	But now be not grieved, nor be angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither; for in order to preserve life did God send me before you.
001	GEN	045	006	For these two years hath the famine been already in the land; and there are yet five years, in which there will be neither ploughing nor harvesting.
001	GEN	045	007	And God hath thus sent me before you to prepare for you a permanence on the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.
001	GEN	045	008	So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God; and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and a lord for all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.
001	GEN	045	009	Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus hath said thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt; come down unto me, tarry not.
001	GEN	045	010	And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that is thine.
001	GEN	045	011	And I will maintain thee there; for there are yet five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty.
001	GEN	045	012	And, behold, your own eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.
001	GEN	045	013	And ye shall tell my father of all my honor in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall hasten and bring down my father hither.
001	GEN	045	014	And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.
001	GEN	045	015	And he kissed all his brothers, and wept upon them; and after that his brothers spoke with him.
001	GEN	045	016	And the report thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brothers are come; and it was pleasing in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants.
001	GEN	045	017	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brothers, This do ye; load your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;
001	GEN	045	018	And take your father and your households, and come unto me; and I will give you the best of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.
001	GEN	045	019	And thou art commanded, This do ye, take unto yourselves out of the land of Egypt wagons for your little ones, and for your wives, and take up your father, and come.
001	GEN	045	020	And do ye feel no concern on account of your household goods; for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.
001	GEN	045	021	And the children of Israel did so; and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the command of Pharaoh; and he gave them provision for the way.
001	GEN	045	022	To all of them he gave to each changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.
001	GEN	045	023	And to his father he sent after this manner: ten asses laden with the best things of Egypt, and ten she-asses laden with corn and bread and other food for his father, for the journey.
001	GEN	045	024	And he accompanied his brothers on the way, and they departed: and he said unto them, Do not fall out by the way.
001	GEN	045	025	And they went out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan, unto Jacob their father.
001	GEN	045	026	And they told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive; and that he is governor over all the land of Egypt. But his heart remained cold, for he believed them not.
001	GEN	045	027	But when they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them; and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him: the spirit of Jacob their father revived.
001	GEN	045	028	And Israel said, Enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.
001	GEN	046	001	And Israel commenced his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.
001	GEN	046	002	And God spoke unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.
001	GEN	046	003	And he said, I am God, the God of thy father; fear not to go down into Egypt; for a great nation will I make of thee there:
001	GEN	046	004	I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again; and Joseph shall put his hand upon thy eyes.
001	GEN	046	005	And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.
001	GEN	046	006	And they took their cattle and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt; Jacob, and all his seed with him:
001	GEN	046	007	His sons, and his son's sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed he brought with him into Egypt.
001	GEN	046	008	And these are the names of the children of Israel, that came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: the first-born of Jacob, Reuben.
001	GEN	046	009	And the sons of Reuben: Chanoch, and Pallu, and Chezron, and Carmi.
001	GEN	046	010	And the sons of Simeon: Yemuel, and Yamin, and Ohad, and Yachin, and Zochar, and Shaul the son of the Canaanitish woman.
001	GEN	046	011	And the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kehath, and Merari.
001	GEN	046	012	And the sons of Judah: 'Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Perez, and Zerach; but 'Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan, and the sons of Perez were Chezron and Chamul.
001	GEN	046	013	And the sons of Issachar: Tola, and Puvah, and Yob, and Shimron.
001	GEN	046	014	And the sons of Zebulun: Sered, and Elon, and Yachleel.
001	GEN	046	015	These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore unto Jacob in Padan-aram, with Dinah his daughter: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three.
001	GEN	046	016	And the sons of Gad: Ziphyon, and Chaggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, 'Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.
001	GEN	046	017	And the sons of Asher: Yimnah, and Yishvah, and Yishvi, and Beriah, and Serach their sister; and the sons of Beriah: Cheber, and Malkiel.
001	GEN	046	018	These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and she bore these unto Jacob, sixteen souls.
001	GEN	046	019	The sons of Rachel, Jacob's wife: Joseph and Benjamin.
001	GEN	046	020	And there were born unto Joseph in the land of Egypt Menasseh and Ephraim, whom Assenath the daughter of Poti-phera', the priest of On, bore unto him.
001	GEN	046	021	And the sons of Benjamin: Bela', and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Echi, and Rosh, Muppim and Chuppim, and Ard.
001	GEN	046	022	These are the sons of Rachel, that were born to Jacob: in all fourteen souls.
001	GEN	046	023	And the son of Dan: Chushim.
001	GEN	046	024	And the sons of Naphtali: Yachzeel, and Guni, and Yezer, and Shillem.
001	GEN	046	025	These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and she bore these unto Jacob, in all seven souls.
001	GEN	046	026	All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, that came out of his loins, besides the wives of Jacob's sons, were in all sixty and six souls.
001	GEN	046	027	And the sons of Joseph, who were born him in Egypt, were two souls; all the souls of the house of Jacob, that came into Egypt, were seventy.
001	GEN	046	028	And Judah he sent before him unto Joseph, to direct him beforehand unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.
001	GEN	046	029	And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen; and when he obtained sight of him, he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.
001	GEN	046	030	And Israel said unto Joseph, Let me die now, since I have seen thy face, that thou art yet alive.
001	GEN	046	031	And Joseph said unto his brothers, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and tell Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brothers and my father's house, who were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;
001	GEN	046	032	And the men are shepherds, for they have been owners of cattle; and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, they have brought along.
001	GEN	046	033	And it shall come to pass, if Pharaoh should have you called, and say, What is your occupation?
001	GEN	046	034	That ye shall say, Owners of cattle have thy servants been from our youth even until now, both we, as also our fathers; in order that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.
001	GEN	047	001	Then came Joseph and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brothers, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen.
001	GEN	047	002	And he took some of his brothers, five men, and presented them before Pharaoh.
001	GEN	047	003	And Pharaoh said unto his brothers, What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, as also our fathers.
001	GEN	047	004	They said moreover unto Pharaoh, To sojourn in the land are we come; because there is no pasture for the flocks of thy servants, for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan; and now let thy servants dwell, we pray thee, in the land of Goshen.
001	GEN	047	005	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, thus, Thy father and thy brothers are come unto thee:
001	GEN	047	006	The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land let thy father and brothers dwell; let them dwell in the land of Goshen; and if thou knowest that there are among them men of activity, then appoint them rulers over my cattle.
001	GEN	047	007	And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and placed him before Pharaoh; and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
001	GEN	047	008	And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou?
001	GEN	047	009	And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are one hundred and thirty years: few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.
001	GEN	047	010	And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.
001	GEN	047	011	And Joseph assigned places of residence for his father and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Ra'meses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
001	GEN	047	012	And Joseph supplied his father, and his brothers, and all his father's household, with bread, in proportion to their families.
001	GEN	047	013	And there was no bread in all the land: for the famine was very sore; and the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.
001	GEN	047	014	And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought; and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.
001	GEN	047	015	And when the money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread, for why should we die in thy presence, since the money is all gone?
001	GEN	047	016	And Joseph said, Give up your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if the money be all gone.
001	GEN	047	017	And they brought their cattle unto Joseph; and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks of sheep, and for the herds of cattle, and for the asses; and he supplied them with bread for all their cattle for that year.
001	GEN	047	018	And when that year was ended, they came unto him in the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money with our herds of cattle hath entirely passed into the possession of my lord; there is naught left in sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our land.
001	GEN	047	019	Wherefore shall we die before thy eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread; and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh; and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land be not rendered desolate.
001	GEN	047	020	And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's.
001	GEN	047	021	And as for the people, he removed them to the cities, from one end of the borders of Egypt to the other end thereof.
001	GEN	047	022	Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion assigned them by Pharaoh, and they ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them: therefore they did not sell their land.
001	GEN	047	023	Then said Joseph unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and sow ye the land.
001	GEN	047	024	And it shall come to pass in the harvest times, that ye shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh; and four parts shall be your own, for the seed of the field, and for your food, and for those belonging to your households, and for food for your little ones.
001	GEN	047	025	And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us but find grace in the eyes of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.
001	GEN	047	026	And Joseph made it a statute unto this day over the land of Egypt, that Pharaoh should have the fifth part; except the land of the priests alone became not Pharaoh's.
001	GEN	047	027	And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.
001	GEN	047	028	And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: and the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were one hundred forty and seven years.
001	GEN	047	029	And when the time of Israel drew near that he was to die, he sent to call his son Joseph, and said unto him, if now I have found grace in thy eyes, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh; and deal with me in kindness and truth; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt.
001	GEN	047	030	But when I shall lie with my fathers, thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying-place. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.
001	GEN	047	031	And he said, Swear unto me; and he swore unto him; and Israel bowed himself upon the head of the bed.
001	GEN	048	001	And it came to pass after these things, that some one said to Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick; and he took his two sons with him, Menasseh and Ephraim.
001	GEN	048	002	And some one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph is coming unto thee; and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.
001	GEN	048	003	And Jacob said unto Joseph, God, the Almighty, appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,
001	GEN	048	004	And he said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and I will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.
001	GEN	048	005	And now thy two sons, who were born unto thee in the land of Egypt, before I came unto thee into Egypt, shall be mine; Ephraim and Menasseh shall be unto me as Reuben and Simeon.
001	GEN	048	006	And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, after the name of their brothers shall they be called in their inheritance.
001	GEN	048	007	And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan on the way, when yet there was some distance to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there on the way of Ephrath, the same is Beth-lechem.
001	GEN	048	008	And Israel perceived the sons of Joseph, and said, Who are these?
001	GEN	048	009	And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.
001	GEN	048	010	Now the eyes of Israel were dim through age, he could not see; and he brought them near unto him, and he kissed them, and embraced them.
001	GEN	048	011	And Israel said unto Joseph, To see thy face I had not hoped; and lo, God hath shown me also thy seed.
001	GEN	048	012	And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.
001	GEN	048	013	And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left, and Menasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right, and brought them near unto him.
001	GEN	048	014	And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Menasseh's head; he laid his hands wittingly; although Menasseh was the first-born.
001	GEN	048	015	And he blessed Joseph, and said, The God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God who fed me from my first being unto this day,
001	GEN	048	016	The angel who redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be called on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.
001	GEN	048	017	And when Joseph saw that his father would lay his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he took hold of his father's hand, to remove it from the head of Ephraim unto the head of Menasseh.
001	GEN	048	018	And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father; for this is the first-born, put thy right hand upon his head.
001	GEN	048	019	And his father refused, and said, I know, my son, I know, he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great; but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.
001	GEN	048	020	And he blessed them that day, saying, With thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and Menasseh: and so he set Ephraim before Menasseh.
001	GEN	048	021	And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die; but God will be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers
001	GEN	048	022	Moreover I have given unto thee one portion above thy brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Emorite with my sword and with my bow.
001	GEN	049	001	And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.
001	GEN	049	002	Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father.
001	GEN	049	003	Reuben, thou art my first-born, my might, and the beginning of my strength; the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power [should be thine].
001	GEN	049	004	Unstable as water, thou shalt not have the excellence; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou the one who ascended my couch.
001	GEN	049	005	Simeon and Levi are brethren; weapons of violence are their swords.
001	GEN	049	006	Into their secret shall my soul not come; unto their assembly my spirit shall not be united; for in their anger they slew the man, and in their self-will they lamed the ox.
001	GEN	049	007	Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce; and their wrath, for it is cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.
001	GEN	049	008	Judah, thou art the one thy brothers shall praise, thy hand shall be on the neck of thy enemies; thy father's children shall bow down unto thee.
001	GEN	049	009	Like a lion's whelp, O Judah, from the prey, my son, thou risest: he stoopeth down, he croucheth as a lion, and as a lioness, who shall rouse him up?
001	GEN	049	010	The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet; until Shiloh come, and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.
001	GEN	049	011	He bindeth unto the vine his foal, and to the vine-branch his ass's colt; he washeth his garments in wine, and in the blood of grapes his clothes;
001	GEN	049	012	His eyes shall be red from wine, and his teeth white from milk.

002	EXO	001	008	Now there rose up a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph.
002	EXO	001	009	And he said unto his people: Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more numerous and mightier than we.
002	EXO	001	010	Come, let us deal wisely with them lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there happen to be a war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and depart out of the land.
002	EXO	001	011	And they set over taskmasters, to afflict them with their burdensome labors; and they built treasure cities, for Pharaoh, Pithom and Raamses.
002	EXO	001	012	But in the measure that they afflicted them, so they multiplied and so they spread out; and they felt abhorrence because of the children of Israel.

002	EXO	001	018	And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and he said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men-children alive?
002	EXO	001	019	And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively; ere the midwife cometh in unto them they are delivered.
002	EXO	001	020	And God dealt well with the midwives; and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.
002	EXO	001	021	And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.

002	EXO	002	006	And she opened it, and saw the child, and, behold, it was a weeping boy; and she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.
002	EXO	002	007	Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse for thee the child?
002	EXO	002	008	And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go; and the maiden went and called the mother of the child.
002	EXO	002	009	And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take away this child, and nurse him for me, and I will give thee thy wages; and the woman took the child, and nursed him.
002	EXO	002	010	And the child grew up, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became to her as a son; and she called his name Moses; and she said, Because out of the water have I drawn him.
002	EXO	002	011	And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown up, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdensome labors; and he saw an Egyptian man smiting a Hebrew man, one of his brethren.
002	EXO	002	012	And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no one by, he smote the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.
002	EXO	002	013	And when he went out the second day, behold, two Hebrew men were striving together; and he said unto him that was in the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?
002	EXO	002	014	And he said, Who made thee a chief and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou hast killed the Egyptian! And Moses feared, and said, Surely the thing is become known.
002	EXO	002	015	And Pharaoh heard this thing, and he sought to slay Moses; but Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and tarried in the land of Midian, and he sat down by a well.
002	EXO	002	016	Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters; and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.
002	EXO	002	017	And the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses arose and helped them, and watered their flock.
002	EXO	002	018	And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, Wherefore are ye come home so soon today?
002	EXO	002	019	And they said, An Egyptian man delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds; and he also drew water for us, and watered the flock.
002	EXO	002	020	And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? wherefore have ye left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.
002	EXO	002	021	And Moses was content to dwell with the man; and he gave Zipporah his daughter to Moses.
002	EXO	002	022	And she bore a son, and he called his name Gershom; for he said, I have been a stranger in a foreign land.
002	EXO	002	023	And it came to pass in this long time, that the king of Egypt died; and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried; and their complaint came up unto God by reason of the bondage.
002	EXO	002	024	And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.
002	EXO	002	025	And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God took cognizance of them.
002	EXO	003	001	And Moses was keeping the flock of Jithro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian; and he led the flock far away into the desert, and came to the mountain of God, to Choreb.
002	EXO	003	002	And an angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a thorn-bush; and he looked, and, behold, the thorn-bush was burning with fire, but the thorn-bush was not consumed.
002	EXO	003	003	And Moses said, I must turn aside, and see this great sight, why the thorn-bush is not burnt.
002	EXO	003	004	And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called unto him out of the midst of the thorn-bush, and said, Moses, Moses; and he said, Here am I.
002	EXO	003	005	And he said, Draw not nigh hither; put off thy shoes from off thy feet; for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.
002	EXO	003	006	And he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; and Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look up to God.
002	EXO	003	007	And the Lord said, I have truly seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt, and have heard its cry by reason of its taskmasters; yea, I know its sorrows;
002	EXO	003	008	And I am come down to deliver it out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring it up out of that land unto a land, good and large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Emorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.

002	EXO	003	012	And he said, Because I will be with thee; and this shall be unto thee the token, that I have sent thee: when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.
002	EXO	003	013	And Moses said unto God, Behold, if I come unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they then say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?
002	EXO	003	014	And God said unto Moses, I will be that I will be: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I will be hath sent me unto you.
002	EXO	003	015	And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The Everlasting One, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.
002	EXO	003	016	Go, and assemble the elders of Israel, and say unto them, The Everlasting One, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, hath appeared unto me, saying, I have surely taken cognizance of you and of that which is done to you in Egypt:
002	EXO	003	017	And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt, unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Emorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.

002	EXO	005	007	Ye shall no more give the people straw to make the bricks, as yesterday and the day before; they themselves shall go and gather themselves straw.
002	EXO	005	008	And the number of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall impose upon them, ye shall not diminish aught thereof; for they are idle: therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.

002	EXO	016	009	And Moses said unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the Lord; for he hath heard your murmurings.
002	EXO	016	010	And it came to pass, as Aaron was speaking unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they turned round toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud.
002	EXO	016	011	And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
002	EXO	016	012	I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, Toward evening ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the Eternal your God.
002	EXO	016	013	And it came to pass, that at evening the quails came up, and covered the camp; and in the morning there was a layer of dew round about the camp.
002	EXO	016	014	And when the layer of dew was gone up, behold, there was upon the face of the wilderness something fine in grains, small as the hoar-frost, on the ground.
002	EXO	016	015	And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna, for they knew not what it was; and Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat.
002	EXO	016	016	This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating: an omer for every head, according to the number of your persons that every man hath in his tent, shall ye take.
002	EXO	016	017	And the children of Israel did so; and they gathered, some much, some little.
002	EXO	016	018	And when they measured it with an omer, he that had gathered much had nothing over, and he that had gathered little had no lack: every man according to his eating, had they gathered.
002	EXO	016	019	And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.
002	EXO	016	020	But they hearkened not unto Moses; but some men left of it until morning, and it bred worms, and stank; and Moses was wroth with them.
002	EXO	016	021	And so they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating; and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.
002	EXO	016	022	And it came to pass on the sixth day, that they gathered twofold bread, two omers for every one; all the rulers of the congregation came and told it to Moses.
002	EXO	016	023	And he said unto them. This is what the Lord hath spoken, A rest, a holy rest is unto the Lord tomorrow: that which ye will bake bake today, and what ye will seethe seethe today; and all the remaining lay up for you to be kept until the morning.
002	EXO	016	024	And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses had bidden; and it did not stink, nor was there any worm therein.
002	EXO	016	025	And Moses said, Eat it today; for a sabbath is this day unto the Lord: today ye will not find it in the field.
002	EXO	016	026	Six days shall ye gather it; but on the seventh day, the sabbath, on it there shall be none.
002	EXO	016	027	And it came to pass on the seventh day, that there went out some of the people to gather; but they found nothing.
002	EXO	016	028	And the Lord said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?
002	EXO	016	029	See, that the Lord hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day bread for two days; remain ye, every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.
002	EXO	016	030	So the people rested on the seventh day.
002	EXO	016	031	And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna, [Man]; and it was like coriander-seed, white, and its taste was like wafers made with honey.
002	EXO	016	032	And Moses said, This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded, One omer-full of it is to be kept for your generations; in order that they may see the bread which I gave you to eat in the wilderness, when I brought you forth out of the land of Egypt.
002	EXO	016	033	And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a flask, and put therein an omer-full of manna, and lay it up before the Lord, to be kept for your generations.
002	EXO	016	034	As the Lord had commanded Moses, so did Aaron lay it up before the Testimony, to be kept.
002	EXO	016	035	And the children of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came to an inhabited land; the manna they did eat, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.
002	EXO	016	036	But the omer is a tenth part of an ephah.
002	EXO	017	001	And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeyings, by the order of the Lord; and they encamped in Rephidim, and there was no water for the people to drink.
002	EXO	017	002	And the people quarrelled with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink; and Moses said unto them, Why will ye quarrel with me? why will ye tempt the Lord?
002	EXO	017	003	And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, For what purpose is it that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill me and my children and my cattle with thirst?
002	EXO	017	004	And Moses cried unto the Lord, saying, What shall I do unto this people? but little is wanting and they will stone me.
002	EXO	017	005	And the Lord said unto Moses, Pass on before the people, and take with thee some of the elders of Israel; and thy staff, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thy hand, and go.
002	EXO	017	006	Behold, I will be standing before thee there upon the rock at Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come out from it water, and the people shall drink; and Moses did so before the eyes of the elders of Israel.
002	EXO	017	007	And he called the name of the place Massah and Meribah; because of the quarrelling of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the Lord, saying, Is then the Lord among us, or not?
002	EXO	017	008	Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.
002	EXO	017	009	And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose for us men, and go out, fight with Amalek; tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand.
002	EXO	017	010	And Joshua did as Moses had said to him, to fight with Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, and Chur went up to the top of the hill.
002	EXO	017	011	And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, that Amalek prevailed.
002	EXO	017	012	But when the hands of Moses became heavy, they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Chur supported his hands, one on one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.
002	EXO	017	013	And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
002	EXO	017	014	And the Lord said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in the book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua; for I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under the heavens.
002	EXO	017	015	And Moses built an altar, and called its name Adonay Nissy [The Lord is my Banner].
002	EXO	017	016	And he said, Because the Lord hath sworn on his throne, that the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.
002	EXO	018	001	And Jithro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, heard all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, that the Lord had brought forth Israel out of Egypt.
002	EXO	018	002	Then took Jithro, the father-in-law of Moses, Zipporah, the wife of Moses, after he had sent her back,
002	EXO	018	003	And her two sons; of whom the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been a stranger in a foreign land:
002	EXO	018	004	And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.
002	EXO	018	005	And Jithro, the father-in-law of Moses, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses, unto the wilderness, where he was encamped at the mount of God.
002	EXO	018	006	And he sent word unto Moses, I thy father-in-law Jithro am coming unto thee, with thy wife, and her two sons with her.
002	EXO	018	007	And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and bowed himself, and kissed him; and they asked each other after their welfare; and they went into the tent.
002	EXO	018	008	And Moses told his father-in-law all which the Lord had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians on account of Israel, all the hardship which had come upon them by the way, and how the Lord had delivered them.
002	EXO	018	009	And Jithro rejoiced over all the goodness which the Lord had done to Israel, that he had delivered it out of the hand of the Egyptians.
002	EXO	018	010	And Jithro said, Blessed be the Lord, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.
002	EXO	018	011	Now I know that the Eternal is great above all gods; for by the very thing wherein they sinned presumptuously was punishment brought upon them.
002	EXO	018	012	And Jithro, the father-in-law of Moses, offered a burnt-offering and sacrifices unto God; and Aaron came, with all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with the father-in-law of Moses, before God.
002	EXO	018	013	And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people; and the people stood around Moses from the morning unto the evening.
002	EXO	018	014	And the father-in-law of Moses saw all that he did to the people; and he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people standeth around thee from morning until evening?
002	EXO	018	015	And Moses said unto his father-in-law, Because the people cometh unto me to inquire of God.
002	EXO	018	016	When they have a matter of dispute, they come unto me; and I judge between one and the other, and I make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.
002	EXO	018	017	And the father-in-law of Moses said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good.
002	EXO	018	018	Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee; for the thing is too heavy for thee; thou wilt not be able to perform it by thyself alone.
002	EXO	018	019	Now hearken unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and may God be with thee, Be thou for the people a mediator with God, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God.
002	EXO	018	020	And thou shalt explain to them the statutes and the laws; and thou shalt make them know the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.
002	EXO	018	021	Moreover, thou shalt select out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating [their own] gain; and place these over them, as rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.
002	EXO	018	022	And let them judge the people at all times; and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge themselves: so shall it be easier for thee, when they shall bear with thee.
002	EXO	018	023	If thou wilt do this thing, and God commandeth it thee, then wilt thou be able to endure; and also the whole of this people will come to its place in peace.
002	EXO	018	024	And Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said.
002	EXO	018	025	And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and placed them as heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.
002	EXO	018	026	And they judged the people at all times; any difficult cause they brought unto Moses, but every small cause they judged themselves.
002	EXO	018	027	And Moses dismissed his father-in-law; and he went his way unto his own land.
002	EXO	019	001	In the third month, after the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day they came into the wilderness of Sinai.
002	EXO	019	002	For they had departed from Rephidim, and they came to the desert of Sinai, and encamped in the wilderness; and Israel encamped there opposite the mount.
002	EXO	019	003	And Moses went up unto God, and the Lord called unto him from the mount, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel.
002	EXO	019	004	Ye have yourselves seen what I have done unto the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.
002	EXO	019	005	Now therefore, if you will truly obey my voice, and keep my covenant, then shall ye be unto me a peculiar treasure above all nations; for all the earth is mine:
002	EXO	019	006	And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation; these are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.
002	EXO	019	007	And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before them all these words which the Lord had commanded him.
002	EXO	019	008	And all the people answered unanimously, and said, all that the Lord hath spoken will we do; and Moses returned the words of the people unto the Lord.
002	EXO	019	009	And the Lord said unto Moses, Behold, I will come unto thee in a thick cloud, for the sake that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and that also in thee they shall believe for ever; and Moses told the words of the people unto the Lord.
002	EXO	019	010	And the Lord said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their clothes.
002	EXO	019	011	And they shall be ready against the third day; for on the third day will the Lord come down, before the eyes of all the people, upon mount Sinai.
002	EXO	019	012	And thou shalt set bounds unto the people, round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, nor touch the border of it; whosoever toucheth the mount shall surely be put to death.
002	EXO	019	013	Yet not a hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live; when the trumpet soundeth long, they may come up to the mount.
002	EXO	019	014	And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people: and they washed their clothes.
002	EXO	019	015	And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day; approach not unto a woman.
002	EXO	019	016	And it came to pass on the third day when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a heavy cloud was upon the mount, and the voice of the cornet was exceedingly loud; so that all the people that were in the camp trembled.
002	EXO	019	017	And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they placed themselves at the foot of the mount.
002	EXO	019	018	And mount Sinai smoked in every part, because the Lord had descended upon it in fire; and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.
002	EXO	019	019	And the voice of the cornet went on, and waxed louder and louder; Moses spoke, and God answered him with a loud voice.
002	EXO	019	020	And the Lord came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount; and the Lord called Moses up to the top of the mount, and Moses went up.
002	EXO	019	021	And the Lord said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the Lord to gaze, and many of them might perish.
002	EXO	019	022	And the priests also, who come near to the Lord, shall sanctify themselves; lest the Lord break forth among them.
002	EXO	019	023	And Moses said unto the Lord, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai; for thou hast charged us, saying, Set bounds about the mount and sanctify it.
002	EXO	019	024	And the Lord said unto him, Go, get thee down, and then shalt thou come up, thou, and Aaron with thee; but the priests and the people shall not break through to come up unto the Lord, lest he break forth among them.
002	EXO	019	025	So Moses went down unto the people, and spoke unto them.
002	EXO	020	001	And God spoke all these words, saying,
002	EXO	020	002	I am the Lord thy God, who have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
002	EXO	020	003	Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
002	EXO	020	004	Thou shalt not make unto thyself any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.
002	EXO	020	005	Thou shalt not bow thyself down to them, nor serve them; for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;
002	EXO	020	006	And showing mercy unto the thousandth generation of them that love me, and keep my commandments.
002	EXO	020	007	Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.
002	EXO	020	008	Remember the sabbath day to keep it holy.
002	EXO	020	009	Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work.
002	EXO	020	010	But the seventh day is the sabbath in honor of the Lord thy God; on it thou shalt not do any work, neither thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates;
002	EXO	020	011	For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day; therefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.
002	EXO	020	012	Honor thy father and thy mother; in order that thy days may be prolonged upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.
002	EXO	020	013	Thou shalt not kill.
002	EXO	020	014	Thou shalt not commit adultery.
002	EXO	020	015	Thou shalt not steal.
002	EXO	020	016	Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.

002	EXO	020	018	And all the people perceived the thunders, and the lightnings, and the sound of the cornet, and the mountain smoking; and when the people saw it, they removed trembling, and stood afar off.
002	EXO	020	019	And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear; but let not God speak with us, lest we die.
002	EXO	020	020	And Moses said unto the people, Fear not; for in order to prove you, did God come, and in order that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.
002	EXO	020	021	And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.
002	EXO	020	022	And the Lord said unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that from heaven I have spoken with you.
002	EXO	020	023	Ye shall not make any thing with me; gods of silver, and gods of gold ye shall not make unto yourselves.
002	EXO	020	024	An altar of earth shalt thou make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt-offerings, and thy peace-offerings, thy sheep, and thy oxen; in every place where I shall permit my name to be mentioned, I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.
002	EXO	020	025	And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone; for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.
002	EXO	020	026	Neither shalt thou go up by steps upon my altar, that thy nakedness be not laid open thereon.
002	EXO	021	001	And these are the laws of justice which thou shalt set before them.
002	EXO	021	002	If thou buy a Hebrew servant, six years shall he serve; and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.
002	EXO	021	003	If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself; if he was the husband of a woman, then shall his wife go out with him.
002	EXO	021	004	If his master should give him a wife, and she bear him sons or daughters: the wife and her children shall belong to her master, and he shall go out by himself.
002	EXO	021	005	And if the servant should plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:
002	EXO	021	006	Then shall his master bring him unto the judges, and he shall bring him to the door, or unto the door-post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him till the jubilee.
002	EXO	021	007	And if a man sell his daughter for a maid-servant, she shall not go out as the men-servants go out.
002	EXO	021	008	If she please not her master, to whom he hath assigned her, then shall he aid her to be redeemed: unto a strange nation he shall have no power to sell her, seeing he hath dealt faithlessly with her.
002	EXO	021	009	And if he should assign her unto his son, then shall he do unto her after the right of the daughters.
002	EXO	021	010	If he take himself another wife, her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.
002	EXO	021	011	And if he do not these three things unto her, then shall she go out free, without money.
002	EXO	021	012	He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall surely be put to death.
002	EXO	021	013	And if he did not lie in wait, but God let it come into his hand, then will I appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.
002	EXO	021	014	But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbor, to slay him with guile, from my altar shalt thou take him, that he may die.
002	EXO	021	015	And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death.
002	EXO	021	016	And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, and he be found in his hand, shall surely be put to death.
002	EXO	021	017	And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death.
002	EXO	021	018	And if men strive together, and one smite the other with a stone, or with the fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed:
002	EXO	021	019	If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his crutch, then shall he that smote him be quit; only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.
002	EXO	021	020	And if a man smite his servant or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand, it shall be surely avenged.
002	EXO	021	021	Nevertheless, if he continue alive a day or two, it shall not be avenged; for he is his money.
002	EXO	021	022	If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her children depart from her, and yet no farther mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, [with a fine,] according as the husband of the woman will lay upon him; and he shall pay this by the decision of the judges.
002	EXO	021	023	And if any mischief follow, then shalt thou give life for life.
002	EXO	021	024	Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
002	EXO	021	025	Burning for burning, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.

002	EXO	021	027	And if he strike out his man-servant's tooth, or his maid-servant's tooth, he shall let him go free for the sake of his tooth.
002	EXO	021	028	If an ox gore a man or a woman, that he die: then shall the ox be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit.
002	EXO	021	029	But if the ox were wont to gore in time past, and warning have been given to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, and he killeth a man or a woman: the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also should of right be put to death;

003	LEV	006	004	Then shall it be, when he hath sinned and is conscious of his guilt, that he shall restore what be hath taken violently away, or the wages which he hath withheld, or that which was delivered to him to keep, or the lost thing which he hath found,
003	LEV	006	005	Or any one thing about which he may have sworn falsely; and he shall restore it in its principal, and the fifth part thereof shall he add thereto; unto him to whom it appertaineth shall he give it, on the day when he confesseth his trespass.
003	LEV	006	006	And his trespass-offering shall he bring unto the Lord, a ram without blemish out of the flocks, of the usual value, for a trespass-offering, unto the priest:
003	LEV	006	007	And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the Lord, and it shall be forgiven unto him, for any one thing of all that he may have done to trespass thereby.
003	LEV	006	008	And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
003	LEV	006	009	Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt-offering: It is the burnt-offering, which shall be burning upon the altar all night unto the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning on it.
003	LEV	006	010	And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and he shall lift up the ashes which the fire hath made by consuming the burnt-offering on the altar, and he shall place them beside the altar.
003	LEV	006	011	And he shall take off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes to without the camp, unto a clean place.
003	LEV	006	012	And the fire upon the altar shall be burning on it, it shall not be put out, and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning: and he shall lay in order upon it the burnt-offering, and he shall burn thereon the fat of the peace-offerings.
003	LEV	006	013	A perpetual fire shall be burning upon the altar; it shall not go out.
003	LEV	006	014	And this is the law of the meat-offering: [one of] the sons of Aaron shall bring it near before the Lord, in front of the altar.
003	LEV	006	015	And he shall lift up from it his handful, of the flour of the meat-offering, and of its oil, and all the frankincense which is upon the meat-offering, and he shall burn it upon the altar, for a sweet savor, as its memorial, unto the Lord.
003	LEV	006	016	And what is left thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: unleavened shall it be eaten in a holy place; in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation shall they eat it.
003	LEV	006	017	It shall not be baked leaven; as their portion have I given it from my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as is the sin-offering, and as is the trespass-offering.
003	LEV	006	018	all the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it, as a fixed portion for ever in your generations from the fire-offerings of the Lord: every one that toucheth the same shall be holy.
003	LEV	006	019	And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
003	LEV	006	020	This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the Lord on the day when he is anointed: the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat-offering perpetually; half of it in the morning, and the other half of it in the evening.

003	LEV	006	022	And the priest that shall be anointed in his stead among his sons shall offer it: it is a statute for ever, unto the Lord; it shall be wholly burnt.
003	LEV	006	023	And every meat-offering of a priest shall be wholly burnt, it shall not be eaten.
003	LEV	006	024	And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
003	LEV	006	025	Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin-offering: On the place where the burnt-offering is killed shall the sin-offering be killed before the Lord; it is most holy.
003	LEV	006	026	The priest who maketh atonement with its blood shall eat it: in a holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation.
003	LEV	006	027	Whatsoever may touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and if there should be sprinkled any of its blood upon a garment, whatever it hath been sprinkled on shalt thou wash out in a holy place.
003	LEV	006	028	And any earthen vessel wherein it may have been boiled shall be broken: and if it have been boiled in a copper vessel, it shall be both scoured and rinsed with water.
003	LEV	006	029	Every male among the priests may eat thereof: it is most holy.
003	LEV	006	030	And every sin-offering whereof any of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation to make atonement therewith in the holy place, shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt in fire.
003	LEV	007	001	And this is the law of the trespass-offering: It is most holy.
003	LEV	007	002	On the place where they kill the burnt-offering shall they kill the trespass-offering; and the blood thereof shall be sprinkled upon the altar round about.
003	LEV	007	003	And all its fat shall be offered up from it; the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards,
003	LEV	007	004	And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is on the flanks, and the midriff above the liver, with the kidneys shall he remove the same:
003	LEV	007	005	And the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto the Lord; it is a trespass-offering.
003	LEV	007	006	Every male among the priests may eat thereof; in a holy place shall it be eaten: it is most holy.
003	LEV	007	007	As the sin-offering is, so is the trespass-offering; there is one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith, his shalt it be.
003	LEV	007	008	And the priest that offereth any man's burnt-offering, —the skin of the burnt-offering which he hath offered shall belong to this priest alone.
003	LEV	007	009	And every meat-offering that is baked in the oven, and all that is dressed in the deep pan, and in the flat pan, shall belong to the priest that offereth it alone.
003	LEV	007	010	And every meat-offering which is mingled with oil, or dry, shall belong to all the sons of Aaron, to one as much as the other.
003	LEV	007	011	And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace-offering, which one may happen to offer unto the Lord.
003	LEV	007	012	If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then shall he offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and fine flour, well sodden, made into cakes mingled with oil.
003	LEV	007	013	Together with cakes of leavened bread shall he bring his offering, with the sacrifice of his thanksgiving peace-offering.
003	LEV	007	014	And he shall offer thereof one out of every oblation for a heave-offering unto the Lord; to the priest that sprinkleth the blood of the peace-offering—to him shall it belong.
003	LEV	007	015	And the flesh of the sacrifice of his thanksgiving-peace-offering shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall not leave any of it until the morning.
003	LEV	007	016	But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice: and on the morrow also shall what is left thereof be eaten.
003	LEV	007	017	But what is left of the flesh of the sacrifice, on the third day shall it be burnt with fire.
003	LEV	007	018	And if the intention was to eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offering on the third day, it shall not be favorably received; to him who offereth it shall it not be accounted; it shall be an abomination, and the person that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity.
003	LEV	007	019	And the flesh, that toucheth any unclean thing, shall not be eaten, with fire shall it be burnt: and as for the flesh, every one that is clean may eat thereof.
003	LEV	007	020	But the person that eateth the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offering, that pertaineth unto the Lord, having his uncleanness upon him, even that person shall be cut off from his people.
003	LEV	007	021	And any person that toucheth any unclean thing, as the uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean thing, and eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offering, which pertaineth unto the Lord, even that person shall be cut off from his people.
003	LEV	007	022	And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
003	LEV	007	023	Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Every manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat shall ye not eat.
003	LEV	007	024	And the fat of a beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn by beasts, may be used for any manner of work, but ye shall in no wise eat of it.
003	LEV	007	025	For whosoever eateth the fat of the cattle, of which one can offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord, even the person that eateth it shall be cut off from his people.
003	LEV	007	026	Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, in any of your dwellings, whether it be of fowl or of cattle.
003	LEV	007	027	Whatsoever person it be that eateth any manner of blood, even that person shall be cut off from his people.
003	LEV	007	028	And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
003	LEV	007	029	Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace-offering unto the Lord shall bring his oblation unto the Lord from the sacrifice of his peace-offering.
003	LEV	007	030	His own hands shall bring it, as the fire-offerings of the Lord: the fat with the breast shall he bring, the breast that it may be waved for a wave-offering before the Lord.
003	LEV	007	031	And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar; but the breast shall belong to Aaron and to his sons.
003	LEV	007	032	And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for a heave-offering, of the sacrifices of your peace-offerings.
003	LEV	007	033	The one that offereth the blood of the peace-offerings and the fat, among the sons of Aaron, shall have the right shoulder for his part.
003	LEV	007	034	For the breast which hath been waved and the shoulder which hath been lifted up have I taken from the children of Israel from the sacrifices of their peace-offerings; and I have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons as a fixed portion for ever from the children of Israel.
003	LEV	007	035	This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing of his sons, from the fire-offerings of the Lord, on the day when he brought them near to become priests unto the Lord;
003	LEV	007	036	Which the Lord commanded to give unto them, on the day that he anointed them, from the children of Israel, as a fixed portion for ever throughout their generations.
003	LEV	007	037	This is the law of the burnt-offering, of the meat-offering, and of the sin-offering, and of the trespass-offering, and of the consecration-offering, and of the sacrifice of the peace-offering;
003	LEV	007	038	Which the Lord commanded Moses on mount Sinai, on the day that be commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the Lord, in the wilderness of Sinai.
003	LEV	008	001	And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
003	LEV	008	002	Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and the bullock for the sin-offering, and the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread;
003	LEV	008	003	And all the congregation shalt thou assemble together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
003	LEV	008	004	And Moses did as the Lord had commanded him; and the assembly came together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
003	LEV	008	005	And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded to do.
003	LEV	008	006	And Moses brought near Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.
003	LEV	008	007	And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put upon him the ephod, and he girded him with the belt of the ephod, and bound it unto him therewith.
003	LEV	008	008	And he put on him the breastplate; and he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.
003	LEV	008	009	And he put the mitre upon his head; and he placed upon the mitre, toward the front thereof, the golden plate, the holy crown; as the Lord had commanded Moses.
003	LEV	008	010	And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them.
003	LEV	008	011	And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times; and he anointed the altar and all its vessels, also the laver and its foot, to sanctify them.
003	LEV	008	012	And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and he anointed him, to sanctify him.
003	LEV	008	013	And Moses brought near the sons of Aaron, and clothed them with coats, and girded them with girdles, and bound the bonnets on them; as the Lord had commanded Moses.
003	LEV	008	014	And he brought near the bullock of the sin-offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock of the sin-offering.
003	LEV	008	015	And some one slew him; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and the [remaining] blood he poured out at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make henceforth atonement upon it.
003	LEV	008	016	And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the midriff of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burnt them upon the altar.
003	LEV	008	017	But the bullock, and his hide, and his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as the Lord had commanded Moses.
003	LEV	008	018	And he brought near the ram of the burnt-offering; and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.
003	LEV	008	019	And some one killed him; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
003	LEV	008	020	And the ram he cut into the proper pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat.
003	LEV	008	021	And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt-sacrifice for a sweet savor, an offering made by fire unto the Lord; as the Lord had commanded Moses.
003	LEV	008	022	And he brought near the other ram, the ram of consecration; and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.
003	LEV	008	023	And some one slew him; and Moses took some of his blood, and put it upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.
003	LEV	008	024	And he brought near Aaron's sons, and Moses put some of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
003	LEV	008	025	And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the midriff of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder;
003	LEV	008	026	And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before the Lord, he took one unleavened cake, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and he put them on the fat, and upon the right shoulder;
003	LEV	008	027	And he placed the whole upon the hands of Aaron, and upon the hands of his sons, and made with them a waving before the Lord.
003	LEV	008	028	And Moses then took these things from off their hands, and burnt them on the altar upon the burnt-offering: they were a consecration-offering for a sweet savor, a fire-offering were they unto the Lord.
003	LEV	008	029	And Moses took the breast, and made therewith a waving before the Lord; from the ram of consecration was it given to Moses as his portion; as the Lord had commanded Moses.
003	LEV	008	030	And Moses took some of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was upon the altar, and sprinkled the same upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and his sons with sanctified upon the garments of him; and he Aaron, his garments, and his sons, and the garments of his sons with him.
003	LEV	008	031	And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil ye the flesh at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation; and there shall ye eat it with the bread that is in the basket of the consecration; as I have commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.
003	LEV	008	032	And that which is left of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire.
003	LEV	008	033	And from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation shall ye not go forth seven days, until the days of your consecration be at an end; for seven days shall your consecration last.
003	LEV	008	034	As they have done this day, so hath the Lord commanded to do farther, to make an atonement for you.
003	LEV	008	035	And at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation shall ye abide day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the Lord, that ye die not; for so have I been commanded.
003	LEV	008	036	And Aaron and his sons did all the things which the Lord had commanded by the hand of Moses.
003	LEV	009	001	And it came to pass on the eighth day that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;
003	LEV	009	002	And he said unto Aaron, Take unto thyself a young calf for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering, without blemish, and bring them near before the Lord.
003	LEV	009	003	And unto the children of Israel shalt thou speak, saying, Take ye a he-goat for a sin-offering; and a calf and a sheep, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt-offering;
003	LEV	009	004	Also a bullock and a ram for peace-offerings, to sacrifice before the Lord, and a meat-offering mingled with oil; for this day the Lord will appear unto you.
003	LEV	009	005	And they brought that which Moses had commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the Lord.
003	LEV	009	006	And Moses said, This thing which the Lord hath commanded shall ye do: and then will the glory of the Lord appear unto you.
003	LEV	009	007	And Moses said unto Aaron, Draw near unto the altar, and prepare thy sin-offering, and thy burnt-offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people; and prepare the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the Lord hath commanded.
003	LEV	009	008	And Aaron drew near unto the altar; and he slew the calf of the sin-offering, which was for himself.
003	LEV	009	009	And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar; and the [remaining] blood he poured out at the bottom of the altar.
003	LEV	009	010	And the fat, and the kidneys, and the midriff from the liver of the sin-offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the Lord had commanded Moses.
003	LEV	009	011	And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.
003	LEV	009	012	And he slew the burnt-offering; and the sons of Aaron presented unto him the blood, and he sprinkled it upon the altar round about.
003	LEV	009	013	And the burnt-offering they presented unto him, in its proper pieces, together with the head: and he burnt them upon the altar.
003	LEV	009	014	And he washed the inwards and the legs; and he burnt them upon the burnt-offering on the altar.
003	LEV	009	015	And he brought near the people's offering; and he took the goat of the sin-offering which belonged to the people, and slew it, and made atonement with its blood, as the first.
003	LEV	009	016	And he brought near the burnt-offering, and offered it according to the prescribed manner.
003	LEV	009	017	And he brought near the meat-offering, and he filled his hand thereof, and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt-sacrifice of the morning.
003	LEV	009	018	He slew also the bullock and the ram, the sacrifice of peace-offering which belonged to the people: and the sons of Aaron presented unto him the blood, and he sprinkled it upon the altar round about,
003	LEV	009	019	Also the fat of the bullock, and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the midriff of the liver;
003	LEV	009	020	And they put these pieces of fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar;
003	LEV	009	021	And with the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron made a waving before the Lord; as Moses had commanded.
003	LEV	009	022	And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and came down after he had offered the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and peace-offerings.
003	LEV	009	023	And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came then out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the Lord appeared unto all the people.
003	LEV	009	024	And there came forth a fire from before the Lord, and consumed upon the altar the burnt-offering and the fat; and when all the people saw this, they shouted, and fell on their faces.
003	LEV	010	001	And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took each his censer, and they put therein fire, and put thereon incense: and they brought near before the Lord a strange fire, which he had not commanded them.
003	LEV	010	002	And there went out a fire from before the Lord, and consumed them, and they died before the Lord.
003	LEV	010	003	Then said Moses unto Aaron, This is what the Lord hath spoken, saying, On those who are near unto me will I be sanctified, and before all the people will I be glorified: and Aaron held his peace.
003	LEV	010	004	And Moses called unto Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of 'Uzziel, the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary to without the camp.
003	LEV	010	005	And they came near, and carried them in their coats to without the camp; as Moses had spoken.
003	LEV	010	006	And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Elazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, The hair of your head you shall not let grow long, and your garments you shall not rend, that ye die not, and that he be not wroth upon the whole congregation; but your brethren, the whole house of Israel, may bewail the burning which the Lord hath kindled.
003	LEV	010	007	And from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation shall ye not go out, lest ye die; for the anointing oil of the Lord is upon you; and they did according to the word of Moses.
003	LEV	010	008	And the Lord spoke unto Aaron, saying,
003	LEV	010	009	Wine or strong drink shalt thou not drink, neither thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go in unto the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations.
003	LEV	010	010	So that ye may be able to distinguish between the holy and the unholy, and between the unclean and the clean;
003	LEV	010	011	And that ye may be able to teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the Lord hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.
003	LEV	010	012	And Moses spoke unto Aaron, and unto Elazar and unto Ithamar his sons, that were left, Take ye the meat-offering that is left of the fire-offerings of the Lord, and eat it unleavened beside the altar; for it is most holy.
003	LEV	010	013	And ye shall eat it in a holy place, because it is thy fixed portion, and the fixed portion of thy sons, from the fire-offerings of the Lord; for so have I been commanded.
003	LEV	010	014	And the breast which hath been waved and the shoulder which hath been lifted up, shall ye eat in a clean place, thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee; for as thy fixed portion, and the fixed portion of thy sons, have they been given from the sacrifices of peace-offerings of the children of Israel.
003	LEV	010	015	The shoulder which is waved and the breast which is lifted up, shall they bring with the fat of the fire-offering, to make therewith a waving before the Lord: and then shall it be thine, and thy sons with thee, as a fixed portion for ever; as the Lord hath commanded.
003	LEV	010	016	And the goat of the sin-offering Moses sought diligently, and behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Elazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron who had been left, and said,
003	LEV	010	017	Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin-offering in the holy place, seeing that it is most holy, and that he hath given it to you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the Lord?
003	LEV	010	018	Behold, its blood was not brought within the holy place: ye should then have eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded.
003	LEV	010	019	And Aaron spoke unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin-offering, and their burnt-offering before the Lord; and things as these have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin-offering today, would it have been pleasing in the eyes of the Lord?
003	LEV	010	020	And when Moses heard this, it was pleasing in his eyes.
003	LEV	011	001	And the Lord spoke unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,
003	LEV	011	002	Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts which ye may eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.
003	LEV	011	003	Whatsoever divideth the hoof, and is cloven-footed, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that may ye eat.
003	LEV	011	004	But these shall ye not eat, of those that chew the cud, or of those that divide the hoof: the camel; because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.
003	LEV	011	005	And the cony; because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.
003	LEV	011	006	And the hare; because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.
003	LEV	011	007	And the swine; because he divideth the hoof, and is cloven-footed, but he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean unto you.
003	LEV	011	008	Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcass shall ye not touch; they are unclean unto you.
003	LEV	011	009	These may ye eat, of all that are in the waters: all that have fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them may ye eat.
003	LEV	011	010	But all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of whatever moveth in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, shall be an abomination unto you:
003	LEV	011	011	And an abomination shall they remain unto you; of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcasses ye shall have in abomination.
003	LEV	011	012	Whatsoever hath not fins and scales in the waters, shall be an abomination unto you.
003	LEV	011	013	And these shall ye have in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: The eagle, and the ossifrage, and the osprey,
003	LEV	011	014	And the vulture, and the kite after his kind;
003	LEV	011	015	Every raven after his kind:
003	LEV	011	016	And the ostrich, and the night-hawk, and the cuckoo, and the hawk after his kind;
003	LEV	011	017	And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,
003	LEV	011	018	And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier-eagle,
003	LEV	011	019	And the stork, the heron after his kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.
003	LEV	011	020	All flying insects that walk upon four feet, shall be an abomination unto you.
003	LEV	011	021	Yet these may ye eat, among all the flying insects that walk on four feet, which have spring-legs above their feet, to leap therewith upon the earth.
003	LEV	011	022	These of them may ye eat: The locust after its kind, and the sol'am after its kind, and the chargol after its kind, and the chagab after its kind.
003	LEV	011	023	But all flying insects, which have four feet, shall be an abomination unto you;
003	LEV	011	024	And through these shall ye be rendered unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcass of them shall be unclean until the evening;
003	LEV	011	025	And whosoever beareth aught of their carcass shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening.
003	LEV	011	026	Every species of beast, which divideth the hoof and is not cloven-footed nor cheweth the cud, is unclean unto you: every one that toucheth the same shall be unclean.
003	LEV	011	027	And all that walk upon their paws, among all manner of beasts that walk on four feet, are unclean unto you; whosoever toucheth their carcass shall be unclean until the evening.
003	LEV	011	028	And he that beareth their carcass shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening: unclean shall they be unto you.
003	LEV	011	029	And these shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth: The weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after its kind,
003	LEV	011	030	And the hedgehog, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, and the mole.
003	LEV	011	031	These shall be unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch them, when they are dead, shall be unclean until the evening.
003	LEV	011	032	And every thing upon which any part of them, when they are dead, doth fall, shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, every vessel wherewith any work can be done, must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the evening, when it shall be clean.
003	LEV	011	033	And every earthen vessel whereinto any part of them falleth, whatsoever is in it shall be unclean; and itself shall ye break.
003	LEV	011	034	All kinds of food which may be eaten, on which water cometh, shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk, shall be rendered unclean in every vessel.
003	LEV	011	035	And every thing whereupon any part of their carcass falleth, shall be unclean; an oven, or ranges for pots, shall be broken down, they are unclean; and unclean shall they be unto you.
003	LEV	011	036	Nevertheless, a fountain, or pit, receptacles for water, shall be clean; but he that toucheth their carcass shall be unclean.
003	LEV	011	037	And if any part of their carcass fall upon any sowing-seed which hath been sown, it shall be clean.
003	LEV	011	038	But if any water be put upon the seed, and any part of their carcass fall thereon, it shall be unclean unto you.
003	LEV	011	039	And if any cattle die, which is allowed to you as food: he that toucheth its carcass shall be unclean until the evening.
003	LEV	011	040	And he that eateth of its carcass shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening; he also that beareth its carcass shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening.
003	LEV	011	041	And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth is an abomination, it shall not be eaten.
003	LEV	011	042	Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon four feet, down to whatsoever hath many feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth, shall ye not eat; for they are an abomination.
003	LEV	011	043	Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth; and ye shall not make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.
003	LEV	011	044	For I am the Lord your God; ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I am holy: neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
003	LEV	011	045	For I am the Lord that have brought you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God; ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.
003	LEV	011	046	This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth:
003	LEV	011	047	To distinguish between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.
003	LEV	012	001	And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
003	LEV	012	002	Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a male child: then shall she be unclean seven days, even as in the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean.
003	LEV	012	003	And on the eighth day shall the flesh of his foreskin be circumcised.
003	LEV	012	004	And thirty and three days shall she then continue in the blood of her purification; any thing hallowed shall she not touch, and into the sanctuary shall she not come, until the days of her purification be at an end.
003	LEV	012	005	But if she bear a female child, then shall she be unclean two weeks as in her separation; and sixty and six days shall she continue in the blood of the purification.
003	LEV	012	006	And at the completion of the days of her purification, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a sheep of the first year for a burnt-offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtle-dove, for a sin-offering, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest.
003	LEV	012	007	And he shall bring it near before the Lord, and make an atonement for her, and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood: this is the law for her that hath given birth to a male or to a female.
003	LEV	012	008	And if her means will not suffice for a lamb, then shall she take two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, the one for a burnt-offering, and the other for a sin-offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be clean.
003	LEV	013	001	And the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
003	LEV	013	002	If a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a swelling, a rising, or a bright spot, and it might become in the skin of his flesh the plague of leprosy: then shall he be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests.
003	LEV	013	003	And if the priest shall see the plague in the skin of the flesh, and the hair in the plague be turned white, and the appearance of the plague be deeper than the skin of his flesh: it is a plague of leprosy; and [so soon as] the priest shall see him, he shall pronounce him unclean.
003	LEV	013	004	But if it be a white bright spot in the skin of his flesh, and its appearance be not deeper than the skin, and the hair be not turned white: then shall the priest shut up the plague seven days.
003	LEV	013	005	And the priest shall see him on the seventh day; and, behold, if the plague have remained unchanged in its appearance, the plague have not spread in the skin: then shall the priest shut him up seven days more.
003	LEV	013	006	And the priest shall see him again on the seventh day; and, behold, if the plague be somewhat pale, and the plague have not spread in the skin: then shall the priest pronounce him clean; it is a rising, and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.
003	LEV	013	007	But if the rising should spread abroad in the skin, after he hath been seen by the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen again by the priest.
003	LEV	013	008	And if the priest see that, behold, the rising have spread abroad in the skin, then shall the priest pronounce him unclean: it is leprosy.
003	LEV	013	009	If the plague of leprosy happen to be on a man, then shall he be brought unto the priest;
003	LEV	013	010	And the priest shall see, and, behold, if there be a white swelling in the skin, and the hair in it have turned white, or there be a trace of healthy flesh in the swelling:
003	LEV	013	011	It is an inveterate leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean; he shall not shut him up, for he is unclean.
003	LEV	013	012	And if the leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of [him that hath] the plague from his head even to the feet, so far as the eyes of the priest can see:
003	LEV	013	013	If now the priest should see, that, behold, the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce the plague clean; it is all turned white, he is clean.
003	LEV	013	014	But on the day that healthy flesh appeareth therein, he shall be unclean.
003	LEV	013	015	And the priest shall see the healthy flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean; the healthy flesh is unclean, it is the leprosy.
003	LEV	013	016	Or if the healthy flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he shall come unto the priest;
003	LEV	013	017	And if the priest see him, and, behold, the plague be turned into white: then shall the priest pronounce the plague clean, he is clean.
003	LEV	013	018	And if there be a person who hath had in his skin an inflammation, and hath been healed,
003	LEV	013	019	And if there be on the place of the inflammation a white swelling, or a white and dark red bright spot, he shall be shown to the priest;
003	LEV	013	020	And if the priest see, and, behold, its appearance be lower than the skin, and the hair thereof have been turned white: then shall the priest pronounce him unclean, it is the plague of leprosy broken out in the inflammation.
003	LEV	013	021	But if the priest see it, and, behold, there be no white hair therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, and it be pale: then shall the priest shut him up seven days.
003	LEV	013	022	And if it now spread abroad in the skin, then shall the priest pronounce him unclean: it is the plague [of leprosy].
003	LEV	013	023	But if the bright spot remain in its place, and spread not, it is a scar of the inflammation; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
003	LEV	013	024	Or if there be a person in whose skin there is a place burnt by fire, and the mark of the burning become a bright spot, white and dark red, or white;
003	LEV	013	025	And if the priest see it, and, behold, the hair in the bright spot have been turned white, and its appearance be deeper than the skin: it is leprosy, broken out in the fire-wound; and the priest shall pronounce him unclean, it is the plague of leprosy.
003	LEV	013	026	But if the priest see it, and, behold, there be in the bright spot no white hair, and it be not lower than the skin, and it be pale: then shall the priest shut him up seven days.
003	LEV	013	027	And the priest shall see him on the seventh day: if now it have spread abroad in the skin, then shall the priest pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.
003	LEV	013	028	And if the bright spot remain in its place, [and] it have not spread abroad in the skin, and it be pale: it is a swelling of the fire-wound; and the priest shall pronounce him clean; for it is a scar of the fire-wound.
003	LEV	013	029	And if there be a man or woman on whom there arise a plague, on the head or on the beard;
003	LEV	013	030	Then shall the priest see the plague; and, behold, if its appearance be deeper than the skin, and there be in it a yellow thin hair: then shall the priest pronounce him unclean, it is a dry scall, it is the leprosy of the head or of the beard.
003	LEV	013	031	And if the priest see the plague of the scall, and, behold, its appearance be not deeper than the skin, and there be no black hair in it: then shall the priest shut up the plague of the scall seven days.
003	LEV	013	032	And the priest shall see the plague on the seventh day; and, behold, if the scall have not spread, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the appearance of the scall be not deeper than the skin:
003	LEV	013	033	Then shall he be shaved, but the scall he shall not shave; and the priest shall shut up the scall seven days more.
003	LEV	013	034	And the priest shall see the scall on the seventh day; and, behold, if the scall have not spread in the skin, and its appearance be not deeper than the skin: then shall the priest pronounce him clean, and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.
003	LEV	013	035	But if the scall should spread abroad in the skin after his being pronounced clean:
003	LEV	013	036	Then shall the priest see him; and, behold, if the scall have spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for the yellow hair; he is unclean.
003	LEV	013	037	But if the scall have remained stationary in its color, and black hair have grown up therein: the scall is then healed, he is clean; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
003	LEV	013	038	And if there be a man or a woman having in the skin of their flesh bright spots, white bright spots;
003	LEV	013	039	And if the priest do see, and, behold, there are in the skin of their flesh bright spots, pale and white: it is a freckly eruption grown in the skin; he is clean.
003	LEV	013	040	And if there be a man whose hair of the head fall off, he is a bald head; he is clean.
003	LEV	013	041	And if from the side of his face his hair fall off, he is forehead-bald; he is clean.
003	LEV	013	042	But if there be on the bald head, or the bald forehead, an eruption, white and dark red: it is the leprosy sprung up on his bald head, or his bald forehead.
003	LEV	013	043	And the priest shall see him; and, behold, if the swelling of the eruption be white and dark red on his bald head, or on his bald forehead, like the appearance of the leprosy on the [other parts of the] skin of the flesh:
003	LEV	013	044	He is a leprous man, he is unclean; the priest shall pronounce him unclean; his plague is on his head.
003	LEV	013	045	And the leper on whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and his head shall be bare, and he shall cover himself up to his upper lip, and, Unclean, unclean, shall he call out.
003	LEV	013	046	All the days whereon the plague which rendereth unclean is on him, he shall be unclean; alone shall he dwell; without the camp shall his habitation be.
003	LEV	013	047	And if there be a garment on which there arise a plague of leprosy, whether it be on a woollen garment, or on a linen garment;
003	LEV	013	048	Whether it be on the warp, or on the woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether on a skin, or on any thing made of skin;
003	LEV	013	049	And the plague be dark green or dark red, on the garment, or on the skin, or on the warp, or on the woof, or on any article made of skin: it is the plague of leprosy; and it shall be shown unto the priest.
003	LEV	013	050	And the priest shall see the plague, and shut up the plague seven days.
003	LEV	013	051	And if he see the plague on the seventh day, that the plague have spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in the skin, or in any article that is made of skin: the plague is a corroding leprosy; it is unclean.
003	LEV	013	052	And he shall then burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woollen or in linen, or any article of skin, whereon the plague is; for it is a corroding leprosy, in fire shall it be burnt.
003	LEV	013	053	And if the priest shall see, and, behold, the plague have not spread on the garment, either on the warp, or on the woof, or on any article of skin:
003	LEV	013	054	Then shall the priest command that they wash the thing whereon the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more.
003	LEV	013	055	And if the priest see, after the plague hath been washed, and, behold, the plague have not changed its color, and the plague have not spread: it is unclean, in fire shalt thou burn it; it is a decay on its inside or on its outside.
003	LEV	013	056	And if the priest see, and, behold, the plague have become pale after its having been washed: then shall he tear it out from the garment, or from the skin, or from the warp, or from the woof.
003	LEV	013	057	And if it appear again on the garment, either on the warp, or on the woof, or on any instrument of skin: it is a growing plague; with fire shalt thou burn that whereon the plague is.
003	LEV	013	058	And the garment, either the warp or the woof, or every instrument of skin, which thou shalt wash, and the plague depart therefrom, shall be washed the second time, when it shall be clean.
003	LEV	013	059	This is the law of the plague of leprosy on a garment of woollen or linen, either in the warp, or the woof, or any article of skin, to pronounce it clean, or unclean.
003	LEV	014	001	And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
003	LEV	014	002	This shall be the law of the leper on the day of his being cleansed: He shall be brought unto the priest.
003	LEV	014	003	And the priest shall go forth to without the camp; and if the priest see, and, behold, the plague of leprosy be healed on the leper:
003	LEV	014	004	Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two healthy, clean birds, and cedar wood, and a string of scarlet yarn, and hyssop.
003	LEV	014	005	And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water.
003	LEV	014	006	As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the string of scarlet yarn, and the hyssop, and he shall dip these and the living bird into the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water:
003	LEV	014	007	And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times; and when he hath cleansed him, he shall let the living bird fly forth into the open field.
003	LEV	014	008	And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, and he shall be clean, and after that he may come into the camp; but he shall tarry outside of his tent seven days.
003	LEV	014	009	And it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave off all his hair, his head, and his beard, and his eyebrows, even all his hair shall he shave off: and he shall wash his clothes, he shall also wash his flesh in water, when he shall be clean.
003	LEV	014	010	And on the eighth day he shall take two sheep without blemish, and one ewe of the first year without blemish, and three-tenth parts of fine flour for a meat-offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil.
003	LEV	014	011	And the priest who cleanseth shall cause the man that is to be made clean, and these things, to stand before the Lord, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:
003	LEV	014	012	And the priest shall take the one sheep, and offer the same for a trespass-offering, with the log of oil; and he shall make with them a waving before the Lord.
003	LEV	014	013	And he shall slay the sheep on the place where the sin-offering and the burnt-offering are killed, in the holy place; for as the sin-offering so doth the trespass-offering belong to the priest: it is most holy.
003	LEV	014	014	And the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass-offering; and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.
003	LEV	014	015	And the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand.

003	LEV	014	019	And the priest shall prepare the sin-offering, and make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness; and afterward shall he kill the burnt-offering:
003	LEV	014	020	And the priest shall offer the burnt-offering and the meat-offering upon the altar; and the priest shall [thus] make an atonement for him, and he shall be clean.
003	LEV	014	021	But if he be poor, and his means do not suffice, then shall he take one sheep for a trespass-offering to be waved, to make an atonement for him; and one-tenth part of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat-offering, and a log of oil;
003	LEV	014	022	And two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, for which his means suffice; and one shall be a sin-offering, and the other a burnt-offering.

003	LEV	014	026	And some of the oil shall the priest pour into the palm of his own left hand:
003	LEV	014	027	And the priest shall sprinkle with his finger of the right hand some of the oil that is in his left hand, seven times before the Lord;
003	LEV	014	028	And the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot; upon the place of the blood of the trespass-offering;
003	LEV	014	029	And what is left of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make an atonement for him before the Lord.
003	LEV	014	030	And he shall offer the one of the turtle-doves, or of the young pigeons, from what his means enable him [to bring];
003	LEV	014	031	Even what his means enable him, the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, with the meat-offering: and the priest shall [thus] make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed, before the Lord.
003	LEV	014	032	This is the law of him on whom is the plague of leprosy, whose means are not sufficient when he is cleansed.
003	LEV	014	033	And the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
003	LEV	014	034	When ye come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy on a house of the land of your possession:
003	LEV	014	035	Then shall he that owneth the house come and tell the priest, saying, Something like a leprosy hath shown itself to me in the house.
003	LEV	014	036	And the priest shall command that they clear out the house, before the priest go into it to see the plague, that all be not made unclean that is in the house: and after this shall the priest go in to see the house.
003	LEV	014	037	And he shall view the plague, and, behold, if the plague be in the walls of the house, in depressions, dark green or dark red, and their appearance be deeper than the wall:
003	LEV	014	038	Then shall the priest go out of the house to the door of the house, and lock up the house seven days.
003	LEV	014	039	And the priest shall come again on the seventh day; and if he see, that, behold, the plague have spread in the walls of the house:
003	LEV	014	040	Then shall the priest command that they break out the stones on which the plague is; and they shall cast them forth without the city on an unclean place.
003	LEV	014	041	And the house he shall cause to be scraped within round about; and they shall pour out the rubbish that they have scraped off without the city on an unclean place.
003	LEV	014	042	And they shall take other stones, and put them into the place of these stones; and other mortar shall he take, and shall plaster the house.
003	LEV	014	043	And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after he hath taken away the stones, and after the house hath been scraped, and after it hath been plastered:
003	LEV	014	044	Then shall the priest come; and if he see that, behold, the plague have spread in the house, it is a corrosive leprosy in the house; it is unclean.
003	LEV	014	045	And he shall break down the house, its stones, and the timbers thereof, and all the mortar of the house; and he shall carry them forth to without the city, unto an unclean place.
003	LEV	014	046	And he that goeth into the house, all the days that it is locked up, shall be unclean until the evening.
003	LEV	014	047	And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.
003	LEV	014	048	But if the priest should come in, and see, and, behold, the plague have not spread in the house, after the house was plastered: then shall the priest pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed.
003	LEV	014	049	And he shall take, to atone for the house, two birds, and cedar wood, and a string of scarlet yarn, and hyssop;
003	LEV	014	050	And he shall kill the one bird in an earthen vessel over running water;
003	LEV	014	051	And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet yarn, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle on the house seven times:
003	LEV	014	052	And he shall atone for the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the string of scarlet yarn;
003	LEV	014	053	But he shall let fly forth the living bird out of the city into the open field, and make [thus] an atonement for the house, and it shall be clean.
003	LEV	014	054	This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and scall,
003	LEV	014	055	And for the leprosy of a garment and of a house,
003	LEV	014	056	And for a swelling, and for a rising, and for a bright spot;
003	LEV	014	057	To teach on the day when something is unclean, and on the day when it is clean: this is the law of the leprosy.

003	LEV	015	013	And when he that hath an issue becometh clean of his issue: then shall he number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in running water, and then shall he be clean.
003	LEV	015	014	And on the eighth day shall he take unto himself two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, and come before the Lord, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and give them unto the priest:

003	LEV	016	001	And the Lord spoke unto Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they had come near before the Lord, and died:
003	LEV	016	002	And the Lord said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within the vail, before the mercy-seat, which is upon the ark, that he die not; for in the cloud will I appear upon the mercy-seat.
003	LEV	016	003	With this shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering.
003	LEV	016	004	A holy linen coat shall be put on, and linen breeches shall he have upon his flesh, and with a linen girdle shall he gird himself, and a linen mitre shall he bind on his head; these are holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and then put them on.

003	LEV	016	007	And he shall take the two goats, and place them before the Lord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
003	LEV	016	008	And Aaron shall put lots upon the two goats; one lot “for the Lord,” and the other lot “for 'Azazel.”
003	LEV	016	009	And Aaron shall bring near the goat upon which fell the lot “for the Lord,” and offer him for a sin-offering.
003	LEV	016	010	But the goat on which fell the lot “for 'Azazel,” shall be placed alive before the Lord, to make an atonement with him, by sending him away to 'Azazel into the wilderness.
003	LEV	016	011	And Aaron shall bring near the bullock of the sin-offering, which is for himself, and he shall make an atonement for himself, and for his house; and he shall kill the bullock of the sin-offering which is for himself.
003	LEV	016	012	And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the Lord, and both his hands full of incense of spices, pounded fine, and bring it within the vail;
003	LEV	016	013	And he shall put the incense upon the fire, before the Lord; that the cloud of the incense may envelop the mercy-seat that is upon the testimony, that he die not.
003	LEV	016	014	And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger above toward the mercy-seat, eastward; and before the mercy-seat shall he sprinkle seven times of the blood with his finger.
003	LEV	016	015	And he shall kill the goat of the sin-offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood to within the vail, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it above the mercy-seat, and before the mercy-seat.

003	LEV	016	017	And there shall not be any man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place, until he come out: and so shall he make an atonement for himself, and for his household, and for the whole congregation of Israel.
003	LEV	016	018	And he shall then go out unto the altar that is before the Lord, and make an atonement upon it; and he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about.
003	LEV	016	019	And he shall sprinkle upon it of the blood with his finger seven times; and he shall cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel.
003	LEV	016	020	And when he hath made an end of atoning for the holy place, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar: then shall he bring near the live goat.
003	LEV	016	021	And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and he shall send him away by the hand of a man appointed thereto into the wilderness:
003	LEV	016	022	And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited; and so shall he send away the goat into the wilderness.
003	LEV	016	023	And Aaron shall then go into the tabernacle of the congregation, and he shall take off the linen garments, which he had put on when he went into the holy place, and he shall leave them there:
003	LEV	016	024	And he shall bathe his flesh with water in a holy place, and put on his garments; and come then forth, and offer his burnt-offering, and the burnt-offering of the people, and make an atonement for himself, and for the people.
003	LEV	016	025	And the fat of the sin-offering shall he burn upon the altar.
003	LEV	016	026	And he that carrieth the goat to 'Azazel shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he may come into the camp.
003	LEV	016	027	And the bullock for the sin-offering, and the goat for the sin-offering, the blood of which was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall one carry forth without the camp; and they shall burn in fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung.
003	LEV	016	028	And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he may come into the camp.
003	LEV	016	029	And it shall be unto you a statute for ever: in the seventh month, on the tenth of the month, ye shall afflict yourselves [by fasting], and no work shall ye do, whether it be one of your own country, or the stranger that sojourneth among you;
003	LEV	016	030	For on that day shall [the high-priest] make an atonement for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins before the Lord shall ye be clean.
003	LEV	016	031	It shall be a sabbath of rest unto you, and ye shall afflict yourselves [by fasting], as a statute for ever.

003	LEV	016	033	And he shall make an atonement for the holy of holies; and for the tabernacle of the congregation, and for the altar shall he make an atonement; and also for the priests, and for all the people of the congregation shall he make an atonement.
003	LEV	016	034	And this shall be unto you as a statute for everlasting, to make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year: and he did as the Lord had commanded Moses.
003	LEV	017	001	And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
003	LEV	017	002	Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded, saying,
003	LEV	017	003	Any man whatsoever of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or a sheep, or a goat, in the camp, or that killeth it out of the camp,
003	LEV	017	004	And bringeth it not to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer it as an offering unto the Lord before the tabernacle of the Lord: as blood-guiltiness shall it be imputed unto that man, blood hath he shed; and that man shall be cut off from among his people.
003	LEV	017	005	In order that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they slay in the open field, and bring them unto the Lord, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest, and slay them as sacrifices of peace-offerings unto the Lord.
003	LEV	017	006	And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the Lord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation; and he shall burn the fat for a sweet savor unto the Lord.
003	LEV	017	007	So that they shall offer no more their sacrifices unto evil spirits, after which they have gone astray: a statute for ever shall this be unto them throughout their generations.
003	LEV	017	008	And unto them shalt thou say, Whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who may sojourn among them, that offereth a burnt-offering or a sacrifice,
003	LEV	017	009	And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer it unto the Lord: even that man shall be cut off from among his people.
003	LEV	017	010	And if there be any man of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, that eateth any manner of blood: I will set my face against the person that eateth the blood, and I will cut him off from among his people.
003	LEV	017	011	For the life of the flesh is in the blood; and I have appointed it for you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls; for the blood it is that maketh an atonement for the soul.
003	LEV	017	012	Therefore have I said unto the children of Israel, No one of you shall eat blood, and the stranger that sojourneth among you shall not eat blood.
003	LEV	017	013	And if there be any man whatsoever of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, who catcheth by hunting any beast or fowl that may be eaten: then shall he pour out the blood thereof, and cover it up with dust.
003	LEV	017	014	For the life of all flesh is its blood, on which its life dependeth; therefore have I said unto the children of Israel, The blood of every manner of flesh shall ye not eat; for the life of all flesh is its blood, every one who eateth it shall be cut off.
003	LEV	017	015	And every person that eateth that which hath died of itself, or that which was torn by beasts, be this one born in your own country, or a stranger, shall both wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening, when he shall be clean.
003	LEV	017	016	But if he wash [them] not, nor bathe his flesh, then shall he bear his iniquity.

003	LEV	018	003	After the doings of the Land of Egypt, wherein ye have dwelt, shall ye not do; and after the doings of the land of Canaan whither I am bringing you, shall ye not do; and in their customs shall ye not walk.
003	LEV	018	004	My ordinances shall ye do, and my statutes shall ye keep, to walk therein: I am the Lord your God.
003	LEV	018	005	And ye shall keep my statutes, and my ordinances, which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the Lord.

003	LEV	018	017	The nakedness of a woman and her daughter shalt thou not uncover: her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter shalt thou not take, to uncover her nakedness; for they are near kinswomen; it is incest.
003	LEV	018	018	And a woman together with her sister shalt thou not take, to vex her, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other, in her lifetime.

003	LEV	018	023	And with any beast shalt thou not lie to defile thyself therewith; neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto: it is confusion.
003	LEV	018	024	Do not defile yourselves through any of these things.; for through all these have become defiled the nations which I cast out before you:
003	LEV	018	025	And the land became defiled; wherefore I have visited its iniquity upon it, and the land itself vomited out its inhabitants.
003	LEV	018	026	Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my ordinances, and ye shall not commit any of these abominations; neither any of your own nation, nor the stranger that sojourneth among you;
003	LEV	018	027	(For all these abominations have the men of the land done, who were before you, and the land hath become defiled;)
003	LEV	018	028	That the land may not vomit you out also, when ye defile it, as it hath vomited out the nations that were before you.

003	LEV	019	015	Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment; thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the great; in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbor.

003	LEV	019	023	And when ye come into the land, and plant any kind of tree bearing edible fruit, then shall ye count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you, it shall not be eaten.
003	LEV	019	024	But in the fourth year shall all its fruit be holy for praise-giving unto the Lord.

003	LEV	019	036	Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I am the Lord your God, who have brought you forth out of the land of Egypt.

003	LEV	020	003	And I will set my face against that man, and I will cut him off from among his people; because of his seed hath he given unto Molech, in order to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.
003	LEV	020	004	And if the people of the land should in any way hide their eyes from that man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, so as not to kill him:

003	LEV	022	017	And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
003	LEV	022	018	Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, If there be any man of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that offereth his oblation, be it for any manner of vows, or for any manner of freewill-offerings, which they may offer unto the Lord for a burnt-offering:
003	LEV	022	019	Then shall it be, that it may be favorably received for you, a male without blemish, of the oxen, of the sheep, or of the goats.
003	LEV	022	020	Whatsoever on which there is a blemish shall ye not offer; for it will not be favorably received for you.
003	LEV	022	021	And when a man offereth a sacrifice of peace-offering unto the Lord as a vow, or a freewill-offering of the herds or of the flocks: it shall be without blemish to be favorably received; no kind of bodily defect shall be thereon.
003	LEV	022	022	A blind, or broken-limbed, or maimed animal, or one having a wen, or itch, or scurvy, —ye shall not offer these unto the Lord, and a fire-offering shall ye not make of them upon the altar unto the Lord.
003	LEV	022	023	And an ox or a lamb that hath a limb too long or too short, that mayest thou offer for a freewill-offering; but for a vow it shall not be favorably received.
003	LEV	022	024	And one that is bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut in the testicles, shall ye not offer unto the Lord; and in your land shall ye not make the like.
003	LEV	022	025	And from a stranger's hand shall ye not offer the bread of your God from any of these; because their corruption is on them, a bodily defect is on them: they shall not be favorably received for you.
003	LEV	022	026	And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
003	LEV	022	027	When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then shall it remain seven days by its mother; and from the eighth day and thenceforth shall it be favorably received for an offering made by fire unto the Lord.
003	LEV	022	028	And whether it be ox or sheep, ye shall not kill it and its young both in one day.
003	LEV	022	029	And when ye offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the Lord, offer it so that it may be favorably received of you.
003	LEV	022	030	On the same day shall it be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it until the morning: I am the Lord.
003	LEV	022	031	And ye shall keep my commandments and do them: I am the Lord.
003	LEV	022	032	And ye shall not profane my holy name; so that I may be sanctified among the children of Israel; I am the Lord who sanctify you,
003	LEV	022	033	That brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be unto you a God: I am the Lord.
003	LEV	023	001	And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
003	LEV	023	002	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, The feasts of the Lord, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, —these are my feasts:
003	LEV	023	003	Six days may work be done; but on the seventh day is the sabbath of rest, a holy convocation; no kind of work shall ye do thereon; it is the sabbath [holy] unto the Lord in all your dwellings.
003	LEV	023	004	These are the feasts of the Lord, the holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their seasons:
003	LEV	023	005	On the fourteenth day of the first month, toward evening, is the passover-lamb to be offered unto the Lord.
003	LEV	023	006	And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the Lord: seven days must ye eat unleavened bread.
003	LEV	023	007	On the first day there shall be a holy convocation unto you; no servile work shall ye do thereon.
003	LEV	023	008	And ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord seven days: on the seventh day is a holy convocation; no servile work shall ye do.
003	LEV	023	009	And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
003	LEV	023	010	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye shall have come into the land which I give unto you, and reap the harvest thereof: then shall ye bring an omer full of the first of your harvest unto the priest;
003	LEV	023	011	And he shall wave the omer before the Lord, that it may be favorably received for you; on the morrow after the holy day shall the priest wave it.
003	LEV	023	012	And ye shall offer on the day when ye wave the omer, a male sheep without blemish of the first year for a burnt-offering unto the Lord.
003	LEV	023	013	And the meat-offering thereof shall be two tenth parts of fine flour mingled with oil, as an offering made by fire unto the Lord, for a sweet savor; with its drink-offering of wine, the fourth part of a hin.
003	LEV	023	014	And neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, shall ye eat, until the self-same day, until ye have brought the offering of your God: it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
003	LEV	023	015	And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the holy day, from the day that ye bring the omer of the wave-offering, [that] it be seven complete weeks:
003	LEV	023	016	Even unto the morrow after the seventh week shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall then offer a new meat-offering unto the Lord.
003	LEV	023	017	Out of your own habitations shall ye bring two wave-loaves of two tenth parts; of fine flour shall they be; leavened shall they be baked; they are the first-fruits unto the Lord.
003	LEV	023	018	And ye shall offer with the bread seven sheep without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be for a burnt-offering unto the Lord, with their meat-offering, with their drink-offerings, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the Lord.
003	LEV	023	019	And ye shall sacrifice one he-goat for a sin-offering, and two sheep of the first year for a sacrifice of peace-offering.
003	LEV	023	020	And the priest shall make with them together with the bread of the first-fruits a waving before the Lord, together with the two sheep; holy shall they be to the Lord for the priest.
003	LEV	023	021	And ye shall proclaim on the self-same day, that it may be a holy convocation unto you; no servile work shall ye do; it shall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.
003	LEV	023	022	And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not cut away altogether the corners of thy field when thou reapest, and the gleaning of thy harvest shalt thou not gather up; unto the poor, and to the stranger shalt thou leave them: I am the Lord your God.
003	LEV	023	023	And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
003	LEV	023	024	Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, shall ye have a rest, a [day of] memorial of sounding the cornet, a holy convocation.
003	LEV	023	025	No servile work shall ye do: and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord.
003	LEV	023	026	And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
003	LEV	023	027	But on the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement, a holy convocation shall it be unto you, and ye shall fast; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord.
003	LEV	023	028	And no manner of work shall ye do on this same day; for it is a day of atonement, to make an atonement for you before the Lord your God.
003	LEV	023	029	For whatsoever person it be that fasteth not on this same day, shall be cut off from among his people.
003	LEV	023	030	And if there be any person that doth any work on this same day, then will I destroy the same person from among his people.
003	LEV	023	031	No manner of work shall ye do: it shall he a statute for ever throughout your generations, in all your dwellings.
003	LEV	023	032	A sabbath of rest it shall be unto you, and ye shall fast: on the ninth day of the month at evening [shall ye begin], from evening unto evening shall ye celebrate your sabbath.
003	LEV	023	033	And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
003	LEV	023	034	Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, On the fifteenth day of this seventh month, shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the Lord.
003	LEV	023	035	On the first day shall be a holy convocation; no servile work shall ye do.
003	LEV	023	036	Seven days shall ye offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord: on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation unto you; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord, it is a solemn assembly; no servile work shall ye do.
003	LEV	023	037	These are the feasts of the Lord, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord, burnt-offering, and meat-offering, sacrifice, and drink-offerings, every thing upon its day:
003	LEV	023	038	Beside the sabbaths of the Lord, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill-offerings, which ye may give unto the Lord.
003	LEV	023	039	But on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land, shall ye keep the feast of the Lord seven days: on the first day shall be a rest, and on the eighth day shall be a rest.
003	LEV	023	040	And ye shall take unto yourselves on the first day the fruit of the tree hadar, branches of palm-trees, and the boughs of the myrtle-tree, and willows of the brook: and ye shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days.
003	LEV	023	041	And ye shall keep it as a feast unto the Lord seven days in the year: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations; in the seventh month shall ye celebrate it.
003	LEV	023	042	In booths shall ye dwell seven days; all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths.
003	LEV	023	043	In order that your generations may know, that I caused the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.
003	LEV	023	044	And Moses declared the feasts of the Lord unto the children of Israel.
003	LEV	024	001	And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
003	LEV	024	002	Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure beaten olive-oil, for the lighting, to cause the lamp to burn continually.
003	LEV	024	003	Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the congregation, shall Aaron put it in order [for] from evening unto morning before the Lord continually; as a statute for ever in your generations.
003	LEV	024	004	Upon the pure candlestick shall be put in order the lamps, before the Lord, continually.
003	LEV	024	005	And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake thereof twelve cakes: of two tenth parts shall each one cake be.
003	LEV	024	006	And thou shalt place them in two rows, six in a row, upon the pure table before the Lord.
003	LEV	024	007	And thou shalt put upon each row pure frankincense, that it may be unto the bread for a memorial, as a fire-offering unto the Lord.
003	LEV	024	008	On every and each sabbath day shall he place it in order before the Lord continually, [obtained] from the children of Israel as an everlasting covenant.
003	LEV	024	009	And it shall belong to Aaron and to his sons; and they shall eat it in a holy place; for it is most holy unto him, from the fire-offerings of the Lord, as a perpetual fixed portion.
003	LEV	024	010	And there went forth a son of an Israelitish woman, but who was the son of an Egyptian man, among the children of Israel; and there quarrelled together in the camp this son of the Israelitish woman and an Israelitish man.
003	LEV	024	011	And the son of the Israelitish woman pronounced the [holy] Name, and blasphemed; and they brought him unto Moses: [and his mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan;]
003	LEV	024	012	And they placed him in ward, until the decision of the Lord could be explained to them.
003	LEV	024	013	And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
003	LEV	024	014	Lead forth the blasphemer to without the camp; and all that have heard him shall lay their hands upon his head; and all the congregation shall stone him.
003	LEV	024	015	And unto the children of Israel shalt thou speak, saying, Whatsoever man that blasphemeth his God shall bear his sin.
003	LEV	024	016	But he that pronounced the name of the Lord [with blasphemy] shall be put to death, all the congregation shall stone him; be he a stranger, or be he one that is born in the land, when he pronounceth the [holy] Name [with blasphemy,] he shall be put to death.
003	LEV	024	017	And he that taketh the life of any man shall surely be put to death.
003	LEV	024	018	And he that taketh the life of a beast shall make it good: beast for beast.
003	LEV	024	019	And if a man cause a bodily defect in his neighbor, as he hath done, so shall be done to him;
003	LEV	024	020	Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: in the manner as he hath caused a bodily defect in a man, so shall it be done to him.
003	LEV	024	021	And he that killeth a beast, shall make restitution for it; and he that killeth a man, shall be put to death.
003	LEV	024	022	One manner of judicial law shall ye have, the stranger shall be equal with one of your own country; for I am the Lord your God.
003	LEV	024	023	And Moses spoke to the children of Israel; and they led forth the blasphemer to without the camp, and they stoned him with stones; and the children of Israel did as the Lord had commanded Moses.
003	LEV	025	001	And the Lord spoke unto Moses on mount Sinai, saying,
003	LEV	025	002	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give unto you; then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the Lord.
003	LEV	025	003	Six years shalt thou sow thy field, and six years shalt thou prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;
003	LEV	025	004	But in the seventh year there shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath [in honor] of the Lord: thy field shalt thou not sow, and thy vineyard shalt thou not prune.
003	LEV	025	005	That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest shalt thou not reap, and the grapes of thy undressed vine shalt thou not gather: a year of rest shall it be unto the land.
003	LEV	025	006	And [the product of] the sabbath of the land shall be unto you for food, for thee, and for thy man-servant, and for thy maid-servant, and for thy hired laborer, and for thy stranger, that sojourn with thee;
003	LEV	025	007	And for thy cattle, and for the beasts that are in thy land, shall all its products be [left] for food.
003	LEV	025	008	And thou shalt number unto thee seven sabbaths of years, seven years seven times; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.
003	LEV	025	009	And then shalt thou cause the sound of the cornet to be heard, in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month: on the day of atonement shall ye sound the cornet throughout all your land.
003	LEV	025	010	And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim freedom throughout the land unto all the inhabitants thereof; it shall be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return, every man, unto his possession, and ye shall return, every man, unto his family.
003	LEV	025	011	A jubilee shall this, the fiftieth year, be unto you: ye shall not sow, nor reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather in it the fruit of the undressed vines.
003	LEV	025	012	For it is the jubilee; holy shall it be unto you: from the field shall ye eat the products thereof.
003	LEV	025	013	In this year of the jubilee shall ye return, every man, unto his possession.
003	LEV	025	014	And if thou sell aught unto thy neighbor, or buy aught of thy neighbor's hand, ye shall not overreach one the other;
003	LEV	025	015	According to the number of years after the jubilee shalt thou buy of thy neighbor, according unto the number of harvest-years shall he sell unto thee;
003	LEV	025	016	According to the multitude of years shalt thou increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years shalt thou diminish the price thereof; for a number of harvests doth he sell unto thee.
003	LEV	025	017	And ye shall not overreach one the other; but thou shalt be afraid of thy God; for I am the Lord your God.
003	LEV	025	018	And ye shall do my statutes, and my ordinances shall ye keep and do them; and then shall ye dwell in the land in safety.
003	LEV	025	019	And the land shall yield its fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell in safety therein.
003	LEV	025	020	And if ye should say, What shall we eat in the seventh year? behold, we are not permitted to sow, and we cannot gather in our harvest:
003	LEV	025	021	Then will I command my blessing unto you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth a harvest for three years.
003	LEV	025	022	And when ye sow in the eighth year, then shall ye eat yet of the old harvest; until the ninth year, until its harvest come in, shall ye eat of the old store.
003	LEV	025	023	And the land shall not be sold for a permanence [to the purchaser]; for the land is mine; for strangers and sojourners are ye with me.
003	LEV	025	024	And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.
003	LEV	025	025	If thy brother become poor, and sell away some of his possession: then may his nearest of kin come and redeem what his brother hath sold.
003	LEV	025	026	And if the man have none to redeem it, and he acquire the means, sufficient to be able to redeem it himself:
003	LEV	025	027	Then let him reckon the years since his sale, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; and so shall he return unto his possession.
003	LEV	025	028	But if his means do not suffice to enable him to restore it to him: then shall that which he hath sold remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of the jubilee; and it shall be freed in the jubilee, and he shall return unto his possession.
003	LEV	025	029	And if a man sell a dwelling-house in a walled city: then shall the time of redemption last till the end of the year of his sale; a full year shall his time of redemption last.
003	LEV	025	030	And if it be not redeemed within the expiration of a full year: then shall the house which is in the walled city remain as a permanence to him that bought it throughout his generations; it shall not become freed in the jubilee.
003	LEV	025	031	But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they shall have the right of redemption, and they shall become freed in the jubilee.
003	LEV	025	032	And [respecting] the cities of the Levites, the houses of the cities of their possession, a perpetual right of redemption shall belong to the Levites.
003	LEV	025	033	And if a man of the Levites redeem something: then shall the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, become freed in the jubilee; for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel.
003	LEV	025	034	And a field of the suburbs of their cities shall not be sold; for a perpetual possession is it unto them.
003	LEV	025	035	And if thy brother become poor, and fall in decay with thee: then shalt thou assist him, [yea] a stranger, or a sojourner, that he may live with thee.
003	LEV	025	036	Thou shalt not take of him any usury or increase; but thou shalt be afraid of thy God: that thy brother may live with thee.
003	LEV	025	037	Thy money shalt thou not give him upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase.
003	LEV	025	038	I am the Lord your God, who have brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give unto you the land of Canaan, to be unto you a God.
003	LEV	025	039	And if thy brother become poor near thee, and be sold unto thee: thou shalt not compel him to work as a bond-servant.
003	LEV	025	040	But as a hired laborer, as a sojourner, shall he be with thee; until the year of the jubilee shall he serve with thee:
003	LEV	025	041	And then shall he depart from thee, he and his children with him; and he shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return.
003	LEV	025	042	For my servants are they, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bond-men are sold.
003	LEV	025	043	Thou shalt not rule over him with rigor; but thou shalt have fear of thy God.
003	LEV	025	044	But thy bond-man, and thy bond-woman that shall remain thine, shall be of the nations that are round about you; of them may ye buy bond-man and bond-woman.
003	LEV	025	045	And also of the children of the strangers that sojourn with you, of them may ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they have begotten in your land; and they shall remain to you as a possession.
003	LEV	025	046	And ye may transfer them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a possession; you may hold them to service for ever; but over your brethren the children of Israel, one over the other, ye shall not rule with rigor.
003	LEV	025	047	And if a stranger or sojourner wax rich near thee, and thy brother become poor near him, and he sell himself unto the sojourning stranger near thee, or to a descendant of a stranger's family:
003	LEV	025	048	After he hath sold himself shall he have the right of redemption; one of his brethren may redeem him.
003	LEV	025	049	Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any that is near of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he obtain the means, he may redeem himself.
003	LEV	025	050	And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he sold himself to him unto the year of the jubilee: and the price of his sale shall be according to the number of years, as the time of a hired laborer shall he have been with him.
003	LEV	025	051	If there be yet many years, according to them shall he return the price of his redemption out of his purchase-money.
003	LEV	025	052	And if there remain but few years unto the year of the jubilee: then shall he reckon with him; according to his years shall he return the price of his redemption.
003	LEV	025	053	As a laborer hired from year to year shall he be with him; he shall not rule over him with rigor before thy eyes.
003	LEV	025	054	And if he be not redeemed by [one of] these means: then shall he go out in the year of the jubilee, both he, and his children with him.
003	LEV	025	055	For unto me are the children of Israel servants, my servants are they, whom I have brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the Eternal your God.
003	LEV	026	001	Ye shall not make yourselves any idols, and a graven image, or a standing image shall ye not rear up unto you, and any carved stone shall you not place in your land, to bow down upon it; for I am the Eternal your God.
003	LEV	026	002	My sabbaths shall ye keep, and my sanctuary shall ye reverence: I am the Lord.
003	LEV	026	003	If in my statutes ye walk, and if my commandments ye keep, and do them:
003	LEV	026	004	Then will I give you rains in their due season, and the earth shall yield her products, and the tree of the field shall yield its fruit.
003	LEV	026	005	And the threshing shall reach with you unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto sowing-time; and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and ye shall dwell in safety in your land.
003	LEV	026	006	And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, with none to make you afraid; and I will remove evil beasts out of the land, and the sword shall not pass through your land.
003	LEV	026	007	And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.
003	LEV	026	008	And five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.
003	LEV	026	009	And I will turn myself unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you; and I will establish my covenant with you.
003	LEV	026	010	And ye shall eat very old store, and the old shall ye remove away because of the new.
003	LEV	026	011	And I will set my dwelling among you; and my soul shall not loath you.
003	LEV	026	012	And I will walk among you, and I will be to you a God, and ye shall be to me a people.
003	LEV	026	013	I am the Eternal your God, who have brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bond-men; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and caused you to walk upright.
003	LEV	026	014	But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments;
003	LEV	026	015	And if my statutes ye despise, and if my ordinances your soul loath, so as not to do all my commandments, in that ye break my covenant:
003	LEV	026	016	Then will I also do this unto you, and I will inflict on you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart; and ye shall sow in vain your seed, for your enemies shall eat it.
003	LEV	026	017	And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be struck down before your enemies: and they that hate you shall bear rule over you; and ye shall flee while there is no one pursuing you.
003	LEV	026	018	And if with these things even ye will not yet hearken unto me: then will I chastise you yet more, sevenfold for your sins.
003	LEV	026	019	And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as copper:
003	LEV	026	020	And in vain shall your strength be spent; for your land shall not yield her products, and the tree of the land shall not yield its fruit.
003	LEV	026	021	And if ye walk yet contrary unto me, and if you refuse to hearken unto me: then will I bring more plagues upon you, sevenfold according to your sins.
003	LEV	026	022	And I will send out against you the beasts of the field, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and diminish yourselves; so that your roads shall be desolate.
003	LEV	026	023	And if notwithstanding these things ye will not be reformed by me, and walk contrary unto me:
003	LEV	026	024	Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and I also will punish you, sevenfold for your sins.
003	LEV	026	025	And I will bring over you the sword, avenging the quarrel of my covenant, so that ye shall be gathered together within your cities; and then will I send the pestilence among you, that ye shall deliver yourselves into the hand of the enemy;
003	LEV	026	026	When I break unto you the staff of bread; and ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again by weight; and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.
003	LEV	026	027	And if notwithstanding this ye will not hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me:
003	LEV	026	028	Then will I also walk contrary unto you in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you, sevenfold for your sins.
003	LEV	026	029	And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.
003	LEV	026	030	And I will destroy your high-places, and cut down your sun-images, and cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols; and my soul shall loath you.
003	LEV	026	031	And I will render your cities a waste, and I will make desolate your sanctuaries, and I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors.
003	LEV	026	032	And I will surely make desolate the land: and your enemies who dwell therein shall be astonished at it.
003	LEV	026	033	And you will I scatter among the nations, and I will draw out after you the sword; and your land shall be a desolate wild, and your cities shall be a waste.
003	LEV	026	034	Then shall the land satisfy its sabbaths, all the days of its desolation, when ye are in the land of your enemies: then shall the land rest, and satisfy its sabbaths.
003	LEV	026	035	All the days of its desolation shall it rest, the time which it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.
003	LEV	026	036	And regarding those that are left of you, I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a leaf shaken shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from the sword; and they shall fall with none pursuing.
003	LEV	026	037	And they shall stumble one over the other, as before the sword, without one pursuing: and ye shall have no power to stand up before your enemies.
003	LEV	026	038	And ye shall be lost among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall consume you.
003	LEV	026	039	And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in the land of your enemies; and also through the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.
003	LEV	026	040	And they shall then confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, [that] through their trespass which they trespassed against me, and also that [because] they had walked contrary unto me:
003	LEV	026	041	I also had to walk contrary unto them, and to bring them into the land of their enemies; and then shall their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and then shall they satisfy their iniquity.
003	LEV	026	042	And I will then remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and the land will I remember.
003	LEV	026	043	For the land shall be forsaken by them, and shall satisfy its sabbaths, while it lieth desolate without them, and they shall satisfy their iniquity; because, even because my ordinances they despised, and my statutes their soul loathed.
003	LEV	026	044	And yet for all that, though they be in the land of their enemies, will I not cast them away, neither will I loath them, to destroy them utterly, to break my covenant with them; for I am the Lord their God.
003	LEV	026	045	But I will remember for their sakes the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt before the eyes of the nations, that I might be unto them a God: I am the Lord.
003	LEV	026	046	These are the statutes and ordinances and laws, which the Lord made between him and the children of Israel on mount Sinai, by the hand of Moses.
003	LEV	027	001	And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
003	LEV	027	002	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If a man make a particular vow, [to give] the estimated value of persons in honor of the Lord:
003	LEV	027	003	If the estimated value concern a male from twenty years old, and unto sixty years old, then shall the estimation be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.
003	LEV	027	004	And if it be a female, then shall the estimation be thirty shekels.
003	LEV	027	005	And if [the person be] from five years old and unto twenty years old, then shall the estimation of the male be twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
003	LEV	027	006	And if [the person be] from a month old and unto five years old, then shall the estimation of the male be five shekels of silver, and for the female the estimation [shall be] three shekels of silver.
003	LEV	027	007	And if [the person be] from sixty years old and upward, if it be a male, then shall the estimation be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
003	LEV	027	008	But if he be too poor for this estimation, then shall he present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the ability to pay of him that hath vowed shall the priest value him.
003	LEV	027	009	And if it he a beast, whereof men can bring an offering unto the Lord, all that a man giveth of such unto the Lord shall be holy.
003	LEV	027	010	He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad one, or a bad for a good one; and if he should change beast for beast, then shall it together with its exchange be holy.
003	LEV	027	011	And if it be any unclean beast, of which they cannot offer a sacrifice unto the Lord, then shall he present the beast before the priest:
003	LEV	027	012	And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad; as the priest valueth it, so shall it be.
003	LEV	027	013	And if he will redeem it, then shall he add a fifth part thereof unto the estimated value.
003	LEV	027	014	And if a man sanctify his house as holy unto the Lord, then shall the priest value it, whether it be good or bad; as the priest may value it, so shall it stand.
003	LEV	027	015	And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then shall he add the fifth part of the money of the estimated value unto it, and it shall remain his.
003	LEV	027	016	And if a man sanctify some part of a field of his possession unto the Lord, then shall the estimation be in proportion to its required seed: the seed of a chomer of barley at fifty shekels of silver.
003	LEV	027	017	If immediately after the year of the jubilee he sanctify his field, according to this estimation shall it stand.
003	LEV	027	018	But if after the jubilee he sanctify his field, then shall the priest reckon unto him the money in proportion to the years that remain, until the year of the jubilee, and it shall be deducted from the estimation.
003	LEV	027	019	And if he that sanctified the field will redeem it, then shall he add the fifth part of the money of the estimated value unto it, and it shall be assured to him.
003	LEV	027	020	But if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.
003	LEV	027	021	But the field, when it is freed in the jubilee, shall be holy unto the Lord, as a devoted field: to the priest shall it belong as his possession.
003	LEV	027	022	And if a man sanctify a field which he hath bought, which is not of the fields of his possession, unto the Lord:
003	LEV	027	023	Then shall the priest reckon unto him the amount of the estimated value to the year of the jubilee; and he shall give this estimation on that day, as a holy thing unto the Lord.
003	LEV	027	024	In the year of the jubilee the field shall return unto him of whom he bought it, to the one to whom belongeth the possession of the land.
003	LEV	027	025	And all estimations of value shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary; twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.
003	LEV	027	026	Only the first-born which shall, by being first born, be sacred unto the Lord among cattle, no man shall sanctify; whether it be ox, or lamb, it is the Lord's.
003	LEV	027	027	And if it be an unclean animal, then shall he redeem it according to the estimated value, and he shall add its fifth part thereto; and if it be not redeemed, then shall it be sold according to the estimated value.
003	LEV	027	028	But any devoted thing, which a man may devote unto the Lord of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall not be sold nor redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy unto the Lord.
003	LEV	027	029	Any one condemned, who shall be condemned to death among men, shall not be redeemed: he shall be put to death.
003	LEV	027	030	And every tithe of the land, of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, belongeth to the Lord; it is holy unto the Lord.
003	LEV	027	031	And if a man will redeem any part of his tithe, its fifth part shall he add thereto.
003	LEV	027	032	And concerning the tithe of the herds, or of the flocks, whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the Lord.
003	LEV	027	033	He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he should change it, then both it and the exchange thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.
003	LEV	027	034	These are the commandments, which the Lord commanded Moses for the children on mount Sinai.

004	NUM	011	020	But up to a full month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it become loathsome unto you; because that ye have despised the Lord who is in the midst of you, and ye have wept before him, saying, Why did we come forth out of Egypt?
004	NUM	011	021	And Moses said, Six hundred thousand men on foot is the people, in the midst of whom I am; and yet thou hast said, Flesh will I give them, that they may eat a whole month.
004	NUM	011	022	Shall flocks and herds be slain for them, that they may suffice for them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, that they may suffice for them?
004	NUM	011	023	And the Lord said unto Moses, Should the Lord's hand be too short? now shalt thou see whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not.
004	NUM	011	024	And Moses went out, and spoke to the people the words of the Lord; and he assembled seventy men from the elders of the people, and placed them round about the tabernacle.
004	NUM	011	025	And the Lord came down in a cloud and spoke unto him; and he took some of the spirit that was upon him, and put it upon the seventy men, the elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, but they did not so any more.
004	NUM	011	026	And there remained two men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad; and the spirit rested upon them; and they were of those that were written down, but they had not gone out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.
004	NUM	011	027	And there ran a young man, and told to Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.
004	NUM	011	028	And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses from his youth, answered and said, My Lord Moses, forbid them.
004	NUM	011	029	And Moses said unto him, Art thou zealous for my sake? And oh that one might render all the people of the Lord prophets, that the Lord would put his spirit upon them!
004	NUM	011	030	And Moses retired back into thy camp, he with the elders of Israel.
004	NUM	011	031	And a wind went forth from the Lord, and drove up quails from the sea, and scattered them over the camp, about a day's journey on this side, and about a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and about two cubits high over the face of the earth.
004	NUM	011	032	And the people arose all that day, and all that night, and all the following day, and they gathered the quails; he that had taken the least, had gathered ten chomers: and they spread them out for themselves round about the camp.
004	NUM	011	033	The flesh was yet between their teeth, it was not yet chewed: when the wrath of the Lord was kindled against the people, and the Lord smote among the people a very great plague.
004	NUM	011	034	And he called the name of that place Kibroth-hattaavah; because there they buried the people that had lustfully craved.
004	NUM	011	035	From Kibroth-hattaavah the people journeyed unto Chazeroth; and they remained at Chazeroth.
004	NUM	012	001	And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses, on account of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married; for an Ethiopian woman had he married.
004	NUM	012	002	And they said, Hath then only with Moses the Lord spoken? hath he not also spoken with us? And the Lord heard it.
004	NUM	012	003	(But the man Moses was very meek, more so than any man who was upon the face of the earth.)
004	NUM	012	004	And the Lord said suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Go out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congregation; and these three went out.
004	NUM	012	005	And the Lord came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of the tabernacle; and he called Aaron and Miriam, and both of them went out.
004	NUM	012	006	And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet of your kind, I, the Lord, do make myself known unto him in a vision, in a dream do I speak with him.
004	NUM	012	007	Not so is my servant Moses, in all my house is he faithful.
004	NUM	012	008	Mouth to mouth do I speak with him, even evidently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the Lord doth he behold: wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?
004	NUM	012	009	And the anger of the Lord was kindled against them, and he went away.
004	NUM	012	010	And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold, Miriam became leprous, [white] as snow; and Aaron turned toward Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous.
004	NUM	012	011	Then said Aaron unto Moses, Alas, my Lord, do not, I beseech thee, account to us as sin that wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we have sinned.
004	NUM	012	012	Let her not be as a dead-born child, of which half the flesh is consumed, when it cometh out of its mother's womb.
004	NUM	012	013	And Moses cried unto the Lord, saying, O God! do thou heal her, I beseech thee.
004	NUM	012	014	And the Lord said unto Moses, If her father had spit in her face, would she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut up seven days outside of the camp, and after that let her be brought in again.
004	NUM	012	015	And Miriam was shut up outside of the camp seven days; and the people did not set forward till Miriam was brought in again.
004	NUM	012	016	And afterward the people removed from Chazeroth, and encamped in the wilderness of Paran.
004	NUM	013	001	And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
004	NUM	013	002	Send thou out some men that they may spy out the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel: one man each of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send, every one who is a prince among them.
004	NUM	013	003	And Moses sent them out from the wilderness of Paran by the order of the Lord: they all were men, [who] were heads of the children of Israel.
004	NUM	013	004	And these are their names: Of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.
004	NUM	013	005	Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Chori.
004	NUM	013	006	Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Yephunneh.
004	NUM	013	007	Of the tribe of Issachar, Yigal the son of Joseph.
004	NUM	013	008	Of the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea, the son of Nun.
004	NUM	013	009	Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.
004	NUM	013	010	Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.
004	NUM	013	011	Of the tribe of Joseph, of the tribe of Menasseh, Gaddi the son of Sussi.
004	NUM	013	012	Of the tribe of Dan, 'Ammiel the son of Gemalli.
004	NUM	013	013	Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.
004	NUM	013	014	Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nachbi the son of Vophsi.
004	NUM	013	015	Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.
004	NUM	013	016	These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land; and Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun, Joshua [Yehoshua'].
004	NUM	013	017	And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and he said unto them, Go you up this way at the south side, and go up into the mountain;
004	NUM	013	018	And see the land, what it is; and the people that dwell therein, whether they be strong or weak, whether they be few or many;
004	NUM	013	019	And what the land is on which they dwell, whether it be good or bad; and what the cities are in which they dwell, whether in open places, or in strongholds;
004	NUM	013	020	And what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether there be trees therein, or not; and take ye courage, and take away some of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the season of the first ripening of grapes.
004	NUM	013	021	And they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rechob, on the road to Chamath.
004	NUM	013	022	And they ascended on the south side, and came unto Hebron; and there were Achiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of 'Anak; [now Hebron had been built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.]
004	NUM	013	023	And they came unto the valley of Eshcol, and they cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bore it upon a barrow between two; and [they took some] of the pomegranates and of the figs.
004	NUM	013	024	That place was called the valley of Eshcol, on account of the cluster which the children of Israel cut down from there.
004	NUM	013	025	And they returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days.
004	NUM	013	026	And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and they brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.
004	NUM	013	027	And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou didst send us, and truly doth it flow with milk and honey; and this is its fruit.
004	NUM	013	028	Nevertheless the people are strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are very strongly walled, and great; and the children of 'Anak also have we seen there.
004	NUM	013	029	The Amalekites dwell in the southern country; and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Emorites, dwell in the mountains; and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the margin of the Jordan.
004	NUM	013	030	And Caleb stilled the people toward Moses, and he said, We can easily go up, and take possession of it; for we are well able to overcome it.
004	NUM	013	031	But the men who had gone up with him said, We are not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.
004	NUM	013	032	And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had spied out unto the children of Israel, saying, The land through which we have passed to spy it out, is a land that consumeth its inhabitants; and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature.
004	NUM	013	033	And there we saw the giants, the sons of 'Anak, of the giants' [family]: and we were in our own eyes as grasshoppers, and so were we in their eyes.
004	NUM	014	001	And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried aloud; and the people wept that night.
004	NUM	014	002	And all the people murmured against Moses and against Aaron; and the whole congregation said unto them, Oh who would grant that we had died in the land of Egypt! or that we might but die in this wilderness!
004	NUM	014	003	And wherefore doth the Lord bring us unto yonder land, to fall by the sword? that our wives and our children may become a prey? is it not better for us to return to Egypt?
004	NUM	014	004	And they said one to another, Let us appoint a chief, and let us return to Egypt.
004	NUM	014	005	Then fell Moses and Aaron on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.
004	NUM	014	006	And Joshua, the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Yephunneh, of those that had spied out the land, rent their garments.
004	NUM	014	007	And they said unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, as followeth, The land, through which we have passed to spy it out, this land is exceedingly good.
004	NUM	014	008	If the Lord have delight in us, then will he bring us into this land, and give it to us: a land which is flowing with milk and honey.
004	NUM	014	009	Only against the Lord do ye not rebel; and then ye need not fear the people of the land; for they are our bread: their shadow is departed from them, while the Lord is with us; fear them not.
004	NUM	014	010	But all the congregation said to stone them with stones: when the glory of the Lord appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation unto all the children of Israel.
004	NUM	014	011	And the Lord said unto Moses, How long yet shall this people provoke me? and how long yet will they not believe in me, with all the signs which I have shown in the midst of them?
004	NUM	014	012	I will smite them with the pestilence, and root them out, and I will make of thee a nation greater and mightier than they.
004	NUM	014	013	And Moses said unto the Lord, But when the Egyptian hear, from the midst of whom thou hast brought up in thy might this people; —
004	NUM	014	014	And when they tell to the inhabitants of this land, who have heard that thou, Lord, art in the midst of this people, that face to face thou, Lord, art seen, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that in a pillar of cloud thou goest before them by day, and in a pillar of fire by night; —
004	NUM	014	015	That thou hast killed this people as one man: then will the nations that have heard thy fame, say in this manner,
004	NUM	014	016	That because the Lord was not able to bring this people into the land which he had sworn unto them, hath he slain them in the wilderness.
004	NUM	014	017	And now, I beseech thee, let the greatness of the power of the Lord be made manifest, as thou hast spoken, saying,
004	NUM	014	018	The Eternal is long-suffering, and abundant in beneficence, forgiving iniquity and transgression; but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation.
004	NUM	014	019	Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people, according to the greatness of thy beneficence, and as thou hast been indulgent to this people, from Egypt even until hitherto.
004	NUM	014	020	And the Lord said, I have pardoned according to thy word.
004	NUM	014	021	But as truly as I live, and as all the earth is filled with the glory of the Lord: —
004	NUM	014	022	That all the men who have seen my glory, and my signs, which I have displayed in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice,
004	NUM	014	023	Shall surely not see the land which I have sworn unto their fathers, yea all those that have provoked me shall not see it.
004	NUM	014	024	But my servant Caleb, as a reward that he had another spirit with him, and followed me fully, —therefore will I bring him into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it.
004	NUM	014	025	And the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwell in the valley: tomorrow turn you, and set forward into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.
004	NUM	014	026	And the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
004	NUM	014	027	How long [shall indulgence be given] to this evil congregation, that murmur against me? the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me, have I heard.
004	NUM	014	028	Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the Lord, as ye have spoken in my ears, so will I do to you:
004	NUM	014	029	In this wilderness shall your carcasses fall, and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward; ye who have murmured against me;
004	NUM	014	030	Truly ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I have lifted up my hand to let you dwell therein; save Caleb the son of Yephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.
004	NUM	014	031	But your little ones of which ye said, They would become a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised.
004	NUM	014	032	But as for you, your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness.
004	NUM	014	033	And your children shall wander about in the wilderness forty years, and bear your backslidings, until your carcasses be spent in the wilderness.
004	NUM	014	034	After the number of the days in which ye spied out the land, forty days, yea, each one day for a year, shall ye bear for your iniquities, forty years; and ye shall experience my withdrawal [of protection].
004	NUM	014	035	I the Lord have spoken it, surely, this will I do unto all this evil congregation that have assembled against me: in this wilderness shall they be spent, and therein shall they die.
004	NUM	014	036	And the men whom Moses had sent to spy out the land, and who returned, and caused all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up an evil report against the land,
004	NUM	014	037	Even these men, that had brought up the evil report of the land, died by the plague before the Lord.
004	NUM	014	038	But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Yephunneh, remained alive of those men, who had gone to spy out the land.
004	NUM	014	039	And Moses spoke these words unto all the children of Israel; and the people mourned greatly.
004	NUM	014	040	And they rose up early in the morning, and went up to the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, here we are, and we will go up unto the place of which the Lord hath spoken; for we have sinned.
004	NUM	014	041	And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the order of the Lord? and it will not prosper.
004	NUM	014	042	Do not go up, for the Lord is not among you; that ye may not be smitten before your enemies.
004	NUM	014	043	For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and ye will fall by the sword; since, because ye are turned away from the Lord, the Lord also will not be with you.
004	NUM	014	044	Yet they persisted to go up unto the top of the mountain; but the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and Moses, did not move out of the camp.
004	NUM	014	045	Then came down the Amalekites, and the Canaanites that dwelt on that mountain, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto Chormah.
004	NUM	015	001	And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
004	NUM	015	002	Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them, When ye shall have come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto you,
004	NUM	015	003	And ye will prepare a fire-offering unto the Lord, a burnt-offering, or a sacrifice, in performing a pronounced vow, or as a freewill-offering, or on your solemn feasts, to prepare a sweet savor unto the Lord, of the herds of the flocks:
004	NUM	015	004	Then shall he that bringeth his offering unto the Lord, bring as a meat-offering a tenth part of fine flour mingled with the fourth of a hin of oil.
004	NUM	015	005	And wine for a drink-offering, the fourth of a hin, shalt thou prepare with the burnt-offering or sacrifice, for each one sheep.
004	NUM	015	006	But for a ram, shalt thou prepare as a meat-offering two tenth parts of fine flour mingled with the third of a hin of oil.
004	NUM	015	007	And wine for the drink-offering, the third of a hin, shalt thou bring, for a sweet savor unto the Lord.
004	NUM	015	008	And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt-offering, or for a sacrifice, in performing a pronounced vow, or a peace-offering unto the Lord:
004	NUM	015	009	Then shall he bring with the bullock as a meat-offering, three tenth parts of fine flour mingled with half a hin of oil.
004	NUM	015	010	And wine shalt thou bring for a drink-offering, half a hin, as a fire-offering of a sweet savor unto the Lord.
004	NUM	015	011	Thus shall it be done for each one bullock, or for each one ram, or for a lamb, be it of the sheep or of the goats.
004	NUM	015	012	According to the number that ye may prepare, so shall ye do to every one according to their number.
004	NUM	015	013	All that are born in the country shall do these things after this manner, in offering a fire-offering of a sweet savor unto the Lord.
004	NUM	015	014	And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever may be among you in your generations, and will make an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the Lord: as ye do, so shall he do.
004	NUM	015	015	Congregation! one statute shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth: a statute for ever in your generations; as ye are, so shall the stranger be before the Lord.
004	NUM	015	016	One law and one code shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you.
004	NUM	015	017	And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
004	NUM	015	018	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land whither I bring you:
004	NUM	015	019	Then shall it be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall set aside a heave-offering unto the Lord.
004	NUM	015	020	As the first of your doughs shall ye set aside a cake for a heave-offering; like the heave-offering of the threshing-floor, so shall ye set this aside.
004	NUM	015	021	Of the first of your doughs shall ye give unto the Lord a heave-offering, in your generations.
004	NUM	015	022	And if ye err, and do not observe all these commandments, which the Lord hath spoken unto Moses,
004	NUM	015	023	All that the Lord hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the Lord commanded [the same] and thenceforward, among your generations:
004	NUM	015	024	Then shall it be, if, through inadvertence of the congregation, it was committed by ignorance, that all the congregation shall prepare one young bullock for a burnt-offering, for a sweet savor unto the Lord, with his meat-offering, and his drink-offering, according to the prescribed manner, and one he-goat for a sin-offering.
004	NUM	015	025	And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven unto them; for it is [a sin of] ignorance; and they have brought their offering, a sacrifice made by fire unto the Lord, and their sin-offering before the Lord, for their [sin of] ignorance:
004	NUM	015	026	And it shall be forgiven unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them; for by all the people [was it done] in ignorance.
004	NUM	015	027	And if any person sin through ignorance, then shall he bring a she-goat of the first year for a sin-offering.
004	NUM	015	028	And the priest shall make an atonement for the person that hath erred, in his sinning through ignorance before the Lord; to make an atonement for him, that it may be forgiven unto him.
004	NUM	015	029	For the native born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them: —one law shall be for you, for him that acteth through ignorance.
004	NUM	015	030	But the person that doth aught with a high hand, be he one born in the land, or a stranger, the same dishonoreth the Lord; and that person shall be cut off from among his people.
004	NUM	015	031	Because the word of the Lord hath he despised, and his commandment hath he broken; that person shall be cut off, his iniquity is upon him.
004	NUM	015	032	And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks upon the sabbath-day.
004	NUM	015	033	And they that found him gathering sticks brought him for judgment unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation.
004	NUM	015	034	And they put him in ward; because it had not been declared what should be done to him.
004	NUM	015	035	And the Lord said unto Moses, The man shall be put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.
004	NUM	015	036	And all the congregation brought him forth to without the camp, and they stoned him with stones, and he died; as the Lord had commanded Moses.
004	NUM	015	037	And the Lord said unto Moses, as followeth,
004	NUM	015	038	Speak unto the children of Israel, and say to them, that they shall make themselves fringes on the corners of their garments throughout their generations, and that they shall put upon the fringe of the corner a thread of blue:
004	NUM	015	039	And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the Lord, and do them; and that ye seek not after [the inclination of] your own heart and [the delight of] your eyes, in pursuit of which ye have been led astray.
004	NUM	015	040	In order that ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God.
004	NUM	015	041	I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the Lord your God.
004	NUM	016	001	Now Korach, the son of Yizhar, the son of Kehath, the son of Levi, was presumptuous, together with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben:

004	NUM	016	003	And they assembled themselves against Moses, and against Aaron, and said unto them, Ye assume too much; for the whole of the congregation are all of them holy, and the Lord is among them; wherefore then will you lift yourselves up above the congregation of the Lord?
004	NUM	016	004	And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face:
004	NUM	016	005	And he spoke unto Korach and unto all his company, saying, Tomorrow, —then will the Lord make known who is his, and who is holy, that he may cause them to come near unto him; and him whom he shall choose will he cause to come near unto him.
004	NUM	016	006	This do ye: Take yourselves censers, Korach and all his company;
004	NUM	016	007	And put therein fire, and put upon them incense before the Lord, tomorrow; and it shall be that the man whom the Lord will choose, he shall be the holy one; you assume too much, ye sons of Levi.
004	NUM	016	008	And Moses said unto Korach, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi:
004	NUM	016	009	It is too little for you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near unto himself, to do the service of the tabernacle of the Lord, and to stand before the congregation to minister for them?
004	NUM	016	010	And he hath brought thee near, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee: and now will ye seek the priesthood also?
004	NUM	016	011	For which cause [beware], thou and all thy company that are gathered together against the Lord; for Aaron, what is he, that ye should murmur against him:
004	NUM	016	012	And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; but they said, We will not come up:
004	NUM	016	013	Is it too little that thou hast brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, that thou wilt assume to make thyself also a prince over us?
004	NUM	016	014	Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, and thou hast not given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou bore out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.
004	NUM	016	015	And this displeased Moses greatly, and he said unto the Lord, Have no respect unto their offering: I have not taken away an ass of any one of them, nor have I done wrong to any one of them.
004	NUM	016	016	And Moses said unto Korach, Thou and all thy company, be ye before the Lord, thou, and they, and Aaron, tomorrow:
004	NUM	016	017	And take ye every man his censer, and put incense upon them, and bring ye near before the Lord every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and Aaron, each his censer.
004	NUM	016	018	And they took every man his censer, and put fire on them, and laid incense thereupon; and they stood at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron.—
004	NUM	016	019	And Korach assembled against them all the congregation unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation; and the glory of the Lord then appeared unto all the congregation.
004	NUM	016	020	And the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
004	NUM	016	021	Separate yourselves from the midst of this congregation, and I will make an end of them in a moment.
004	NUM	016	022	And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, this one man doth sin, and with all the congregation wouldst thou be wroth!
004	NUM	016	023	And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
004	NUM	016	024	Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you away from about the dwelling of Korach, Dathan, and Abiram.
004	NUM	016	025	And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and there went after him the elders of Israel.
004	NUM	016	026	And he spoke unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing which belongeth to them, lest ye be destroyed through all their sins.
004	NUM	016	027	So they got away from the dwelling of Korach, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, standing [boldly] at the door of their tents, with their wives, and their sons, and their little ones.
004	NUM	016	028	And Moses said, Through this shall ye know that the Lord hath sent me to do all these deeds; that [I have] not done them out of my own heart.
004	NUM	016	029	If these men die as all men die, and if the visitation of all men be visited on them: then hath the Lord not sent me.
004	NUM	016	030	But if the Lord do create a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertaineth unto them, and they go down alive into the pit: then shall ye understand that these men have provoked the Lord.
004	NUM	016	031	And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground that was under them was cloven asunder:
004	NUM	016	032	And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained unto Korach, and all their goods.
004	NUM	016	033	And they went down, they, and all they that appertained to them, alive into the pit; and the earth closed over them, and they disappeared from the midst of the congregation.
004	NUM	016	034	And all Israel that were round about them fled at their cry; for they said, Perhaps the earth may swallow us up [also].
004	NUM	016	035	And there came out a fire from the Lord, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that had offered the incense.
004	NUM	016	036	And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
004	NUM	016	037	Speak unto Elazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he lift up the censers out of the burning, and throw out the fire far away; for they have been hallowed:
004	NUM	016	038	The censers of these sinners against their own lives; and they shall make of them broad plates for a covering for the altar; for they brought them near before the Lord, and they have thus become hallowed; and they shall serve for a sign unto the children of Israel.
004	NUM	016	039	And Elazar the priest took the copper censers, which they that were burnt had brought near; and they beat them out for a covering unto the altar:
004	NUM	016	040	As a memorial unto the children of Israel, in order that no stranger, who is not of the seed of Aaron, should come near to burn incense before the Lord; that he become not as Korach, and as his company; as the Lord had spoken to him by the hand of Moses.
004	NUM	016	041	And all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron, on the morrow, saying, It is you who have caused the people of the Lord to die.
004	NUM	016	042	And it came to pass, when the congregation assembled against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation, and, behold, the cloud covered it; and the glory of the Lord appeared.
004	NUM	016	043	And Moses came with Aaron before the tabernacle of the congregation.
004	NUM	016	044	And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
004	NUM	016	045	Remove yourselves from the midst of this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.
004	NUM	016	046	And Moses said unto Aaron, Take the censer, and put therein fire from off the altar, and put on incense, and carry [it] quickly unto the congregation, and make an atonement for them; for the wrath is gone forth from the Lord; the plague hath begun.
004	NUM	016	047	And Aaron took as Moses had commanded, and he ran into the midst of the assembly; and, behold, the plague had begun among the people: and he put on the incense, and made an atonement for the people.
004	NUM	016	048	And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.
004	NUM	016	049	And those who died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides those that had died about the matter of Korach.
004	NUM	016	050	And Aaron returned unto Moses, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, after the plague had been stayed.
004	NUM	017	001	And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
004	NUM	017	002	Speak unto the children of Israel, and take from them one staff each for a family division, from all their princes, according to their family divisions, twelve staves: the name of each man shalt thou write upon his staff.
004	NUM	017	003	And the name of Aaron shalt thou write upon the staff of Levi; for there shall be but one staff for the head of their family division.
004	NUM	017	004	And thou shalt lay them down in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I usually meet with you.
004	NUM	017	005	And it shall come to pass, that the staff of the man whom I shall choose, shall blossom: and I will allay from around me the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against you.
004	NUM	017	006	And Moses spoke unto the children of Israel, and all their princes gave him each a staff, one for every prince, according to their family divisions, twelve staves: and the staff of Aaron was among their staves.
004	NUM	017	007	And Moses laid down the staves before the Lord in the tabernacle of the testimony.
004	NUM	017	008	And it came to pass on the morrow, that as Moses went into the tabernacle of the testimony, behold, the staff of Aaron for the house of Levi had budded; and it brought forth buds, and produced blossoms, and yielded ripe almonds.
004	NUM	017	009	And Moses brought out all the staves from before the Lord unto all the children of Israel; and they looked [at them], and took away every one his staff.
004	NUM	017	010	And the Lord said unto Moses, Carry back the staff of Aaron before the testimony, to be kept as a token against the children of rebellion, that there may be an end of their murmurings from around me, and they die not.
004	NUM	017	011	And Moses did so; as the Lord had commanded him, so did he.
004	NUM	017	012	And the children of Israel said unto Moses, thus, Behold, we perish, we are lost, we are all lost.
004	NUM	017	013	Every one that cometh near at all unto the tabernacle of the Lord must die: shall we totally perish?
004	NUM	018	001	And the Lord said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy father's house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary; and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.
004	NUM	018	002	And also thy brethren, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou near with thee, that they may be joined with thee, and minister unto thee; while thou and thy sons with thee shall be before the tabernacle of the testimony.
004	NUM	018	003	And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the tabernacle: only unto the vessels of the sanctuary and unto the altar shall they not come near, that they may not die, either they or you.
004	NUM	018	004	And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, respecting all the service of the tabernacle: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.
004	NUM	018	005	And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar; that there be not any more wrath upon the children of Israel.
004	NUM	018	006	And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from the midst of the children of Israel; unto you are they given as a gift for the Lord, to perform the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.
004	NUM	018	007	And thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priesthood concerning every matter of the altar, and for that within the vail, where ye shall serve: as a service of gift do I give you your priesthood; and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.
004	NUM	018	008	And the Lord spoke unto Aaron, And I, behold, I give thee the charge of my heave-offerings; of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel, unto thee have I given them as an official portion, and to thy sons, as a fixed right for ever.
004	NUM	018	009	This shall belong to thee of the most holy things, from the fire-[offerings]: every oblation of theirs, namely, every meat-offering of theirs, and every sin-offering of theirs, and every, trespass-offering of theirs, which they shall render unto me, shall, as most holy things, belong to thee and to thy sons.
004	NUM	018	010	In a most holy place shalt thou eat it: every male shall eat it; holy shall it be unto thee.
004	NUM	018	011	And this shall be thine, as the heave-offering of their gift, of all the wave-offerings of the children of Israel; unto thee have I given them, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, as a fixed portion for ever: every one that is clean in thy house may eat thereof.
004	NUM	018	012	All the best of oil, and all the best of wine, and of corn, the first-fruits thereof which they shall offer unto the Lord, to thee have I given them.
004	NUM	018	013	The first ripe fruit of whatsoever is in their land, which they may bring unto the Lord, shall be thine: every one that is clean in thy house may eat thereof.
004	NUM	018	014	Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.
004	NUM	018	015	Whatever openeth the womb of all flesh, which they bring unto the Lord, be it of men or of cattle, shall be thine: nevertheless thou shalt redeem the first-born of man, and the firstling of the unclean cattle shalt thou redeem.
004	NUM	018	016	And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to the usual estimation of five shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.
004	NUM	018	017	But the firstling of an ox, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: their blood shalt thou sprinkle upon the altar, and their fat shalt thou burn as a fire-offering, for a sweet savor unto the Lord.
004	NUM	018	018	And their flesh shall be thine: as the breast that is waved and as the right shoulder shall it be thine.
004	NUM	018	019	All the heave-offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel set apart unto the Lord, I have given to thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, as a fixed portion for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before the Lord for thee and for thy seed with thee.
004	NUM	018	020	And the Lord said unto Aaron, In their land shalt thou have no inheritance, and any portion shalt thou not have among them: I am thy portion and thy inheritance among the children of Israel.
004	NUM	018	021	And to the children of Levi, behold, I have given every tithe in Israel, for an inheritance, in lieu of their service which they render, the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.
004	NUM	018	022	And the children of Israel shall not henceforth come nigh unto the tabernacle of the congregation, to bear sin, to die thereby.
004	NUM	018	023	But they of the tribe of Levi themselves shall perform the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: a statute for ever shall it be throughout your generations; and among the children of Israel shall they not possess any inheritance.
004	NUM	018	024	But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as a heave-offering unto the Lord, have I given to the Levites for an inheritance: therefore have I said unto them, Among the children of Israel shall they obtain no inheritance.
004	NUM	018	025	And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
004	NUM	018	026	And unto the Levites shalt thou speak, and say unto them, When ye take from the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance: then shall ye separate therefrom a heave-offering of the Lord, the tenth part of the tithe.
004	NUM	018	027	And your heave-offering shall be reckoned unto you, like the corn of the threshing-floor, and as the fulness of the wine-press.
004	NUM	018	028	Thus shall ye also offer a heave-offering unto the Lord from all your tithes, which ye may receive from the children of Israel; and ye shall give thereof the heave-offering of the Lord to Aaron the priest.
004	NUM	018	029	From all your gifts shall ye set apart every heave-offering of the Lord, from every best part thereof, its hallowed portion therefrom.
004	NUM	018	030	And thou shalt say unto them, When ye have separated the best thereof from it: then shall [the remainder] be counted unto the Levites as the produce of the threshing-floor, and as the produce of the wine-press.
004	NUM	018	031	And ye may eat it in every place, ye and your households; for it is your reward in lieu of your service at the tabernacle of the congregation.
004	NUM	018	032	And ye shall not bear any sin by reason of it, when ye have separated its best part from it: and the holy things of the children of Israel shall ye not profane, lest ye die.
004	NUM	019	001	And the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
004	NUM	019	002	This is the statute of the law which the Lord hath commanded, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee a completely red cow, on which there is no blemish, upon which no yoke hath ever come.
004	NUM	019	003	And ye shall give her unto Elazar the priest, and he shall lead her forth to without the camp, and some one shall slay her before his face:
004	NUM	019	004	And Elazar the priest shall take some of her blood with his finger; and he shall sprinkle in the direction of the front of the tabernacle of the congregation of her blood seven times.
004	NUM	019	005	And some one shall burn the cow before his eyes; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn.
004	NUM	019	006	And the priest shall take cedar-wood, and hyssop, and a scarlet string, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the cow.
004	NUM	019	007	And the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward may he come into the camp; and the priest shall be unclean until the evening.
004	NUM	019	008	And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water; and he shall be unclean until the evening.
004	NUM	019	009	And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the cow, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place; and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of sprinkling: it is a purification-offering.
004	NUM	019	010	And he that gathereth up the ashes of the cow shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening: and it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever.
004	NUM	019	011	He that toucheth the dead body of any human person shall be unclean seven days.
004	NUM	019	012	Such a one shall purify himself with it on the third day and on the seventh day, when he shall be clean; but if he purify himself not on the third day and on the seventh day, he shall not be clean.
004	NUM	019	013	Whosoever toucheth the dead body, the person of any man that is dead, and purifieth himself not, hath defiled the tabernacle of the Lord; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel; because the water of sprinkling was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him.
004	NUM	019	014	This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: Every one that cometh into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.
004	NUM	019	015	And every open vessel, on which there is not a closely fitting cover, is unclean.
004	NUM	019	016	And whosoever toucheth in the open field one that hath been slain with a sword, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.
004	NUM	019	017	And they shall take for the unclean person some of the ashes of the burnt purification-offering, and they shall put thereupon running water in a vessel.
004	NUM	019	018	And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons that have been there, and upon him that hath touched the bone, or the one slain, or the dead, or the grave:
004	NUM	019	019	And the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day; and when he hath purified him on the seventh day, then shall he wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at evening.
004	NUM	019	020	But a man that is unclean, and doth not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation; because the sanctuary of the Lord hath he defiled; the water of sprinkling hath not been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean.
004	NUM	019	021	And it shall be unto them for a perpetual statute; and he that sprinkleth the water of sprinkling shall wash his clothes; and he that toucheth the water of sprinkling shall be unclean until the evening.
004	NUM	019	022	And whatsoever the unclean person may touch shall be unclean; and the person that toucheth him shall be unclean until the evening.
004	NUM	020	001	And the children of Israel, the whole congregation, came into the desert of Zin in the first month, and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.
004	NUM	020	002	And there was no water for the congregation; and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.
004	NUM	020	003	And the people quarreled with Moses, and said thus, Oh that we had but perished when our brethren perished before the Lord!
004	NUM	020	004	And why have ye brought the congregation of the Lord into this wilderness, to die there, we and our cattle!
004	NUM	020	005	And wherefore have ye caused us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place for sowing, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; and water even there is none to drink.
004	NUM	020	006	And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the glory of the Lord appeared unto them.
004	NUM	020	007	And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
004	NUM	020	008	Take the staff, and gather the assembly together, thou, with Aaron thy brother, and ye shall speak unto the rock before their eyes, that it shall give forth its water; and thou shalt bring forth for them water out of the rock, and give drink to the congregation and their cattle.
004	NUM	020	009	And Moses took the staff from before the Lord, as he had commanded him.
004	NUM	020	010	And Moses and Aaron assembled the congregation together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels! shall we out of this rock bring forth water for you?
004	NUM	020	011	And Moses lifted up his hand, and he smote the rock with his staff twice: and there came out much water, and the congregation drank, together with their cattle.
004	NUM	020	012	And the Lord said unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye have not confided in me, to sanctify me before the eyes of the children of Israel: therefore shall ye not bring this congregation into the land which I have given to them.
004	NUM	020	013	These are the waters of Meribah; where the children of Israel quarreled with the Lord, and through which he was sanctified.
004	NUM	020	014	And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus hath said thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the hardship that hath befallen us.

004	NUM	020	017	Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy country; we will not pass through field, or through vineyard, and we will not drink the water of the wells: by the king's highway will we go, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy border.
004	NUM	020	018	And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass through my land, lest I come against thee with the sword.
004	NUM	020	019	And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the highway: and if we drink of thy water, I and my cattle, then will I pay its value; I will do thee no injury, only on foot will I pass through.
004	NUM	020	020	And he said, Thou shalt not pass through; and Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand.
004	NUM	020	021	And as Edom thus refused to permit Israel to pass through his border, Israel turned away from him.
004	NUM	020	022	And they set forward from Kadesh; and the children of Israel, the whole congregation, came unto mount Hor.
004	NUM	020	023	And the Lord said unto Moses and Aaron at mount Hor, by the boundary of the land of Edom, as followeth,
004	NUM	020	024	Aaron shall be gathered unto his people; for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my order at the waters of Meribah.
004	NUM	020	025	Take Aaron and Elazar, his son, and cause them to go up unto mount Hor:
004	NUM	020	026	And cause Aaron to take off his garments, and clothe therewith Elazar his son; and Aaron shall be gathered in, and he shall die there.
004	NUM	020	027	And Moses did as the Lord had commanded; and they went up to mount Hor before the eyes of all the congregation.
004	NUM	020	028	And Moses caused Aaron to take off his garments, and he clothed therewith Elazar his son; and Aaron died there on the top of the mount; and Moses and Elazar then came down from the mount.
004	NUM	020	029	And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was departed, they wept for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.
004	NUM	021	001	And when the Canaanite, the king of 'Arad, who dwelt in the south, heard that Israel was coming by the way of the spies: he made an attack on Israel, and took from them some prisoners.
004	NUM	021	002	And Israel made a vow unto the Lord, and said, If thou wilt but deliver this people into my hand, then will I devote their cities.
004	NUM	021	003	And the Lord hearkened to the voice of Israel, and he delivered up the Canaanites; and they devoted them and their cities: and they called the name of the place Chormah.
004	NUM	021	004	And they set forward from mount Hor by the way to the Red Sea, to go round the land of Edom: and the spirit of the people became impatient because of the way.
004	NUM	021	005	And the people spoke against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, and there is no water; and our soul loatheth this miserable bread.

004	NUM	021	007	And the people then came to Moses, and they said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord, and against thee; pray unto the Lord, that he take away from us the serpents. And Moses prayed for the people.
004	NUM	021	008	And the Lord said unto Moses, Make thyself a serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that whoever is bitten shall look at it, and he shall live.
004	NUM	021	009	And Moses made a serpent of copper, and put it upon a pole; and it came to pass, that, when a serpent had bitten any man, and he looked up to the serpent of copper, he remained alive.

004	NUM	021	013	From there they set forward, and encamped on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wilderness, and which cometh out of the boundary of the Emorites; for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and between the Emorites.
004	NUM	021	014	Therefore mention is made in the book of the wars of the Lord, of Vaheb in Supha, and of the brooks of Arnon,

004	NUM	021	018	Well, which the princes have dug, which the nobles of the people have hollowed out with the sceptre, with their staves; — and from the wilderness to Mattanah;
004	NUM	021	019	And from Mattanah to Nachaliel; and from Nachaliel to Bamoth;
004	NUM	021	020	And from Bamoth to the valley, which is in the fields of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward the desert.
004	NUM	021	021	And Israel sent messengers unto Sichon the king of the Emorites, saying,
004	NUM	021	022	Let me pass through thy land; we will not turn aside into field, or into vineyard; we will not drink the water of a well: by the king's highway will we go along, until we have passed thy border.
004	NUM	021	023	But Sichon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border; and Sichon assembled all his people together; and went out against Israel into the wilderness; and he came to Yahaz, and fought against Israel.
004	NUM	021	024	And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and took possession of his land from Arnon unto Yabbok, even unto the children of 'Ammon; for the border of the children of 'Ammon was strong.
004	NUM	021	025	And Israel took all these cities; and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Emorites, in Cheshbon, and in all the villages thereof.
004	NUM	021	026	For Cheshbon was the city of Sichon the king of the Emorites; and he had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, up to the Arnon.
004	NUM	021	027	Therefore said the poets, Come into Cheshbon, let the city of Sichon be built and established.
004	NUM	021	028	For a fire is gone out of Cheshbon, a flame from the city of Sichon: it hath consumed 'Ar-Moab, the men of the high places of the Arnon.
004	NUM	021	029	Woe to thee, Moab! thou art lost, O people of Kemosh: he hath suffered his sons to become fugitives, and his daughters to go into captivity, unto the king of the Emorites, Sichon.
004	NUM	021	030	We have thrown them down; lost is Cheshbon even unto Dibon, and we have laid waste [all] up to Nophach, which reacheth unto Medeba.
004	NUM	021	031	Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Emorites.
004	NUM	021	032	And Moses sent to spy out Ya'zer, and they captured the villages thereof, and drove out the Emorites that were there.
004	NUM	021	033	And they turned and went up by the way to Bashan; and 'Og, the king of Bashan, went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edrei.
004	NUM	021	034	And the Lord said unto Moses, Fear him not; for into thy hand have I delivered him, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do unto him as thou hast done unto Sichon, the king of the Emorites, who dwelt at Cheshbon.
004	NUM	021	035	And they smote him and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left unto him that escaped; and they took possession of his land.
004	NUM	022	001	And the children of Israel set forward, and encamped in the plains of Moab, on this side of the Jordan, opposite Jericho.
004	NUM	022	002	And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Emorites.
004	NUM	022	003	And Moab was greatly afraid of the people, because it was numerous; and Moab was horrified because of the children of Israel.
004	NUM	022	004	And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now will this assemblage devour all that is round about us, as the ox devoureth the grass of the field; and Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.
004	NUM	022	005	And he sent messengers unto Bil'am the son of Beor to Pethor, which is by the river, in the land of the children of his people, to have him called; saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt; behold, it covereth the surface of the earth, and it is abiding opposite to me:
004	NUM	022	006	And now do but come, curse me this people; for it is too mighty for me; peradventure I may be able to smite it, that I may drive it out of the land; for I know that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.
004	NUM	022	007	And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Bil'am, and spoke unto him the words of Balak.
004	NUM	022	008	And he said unto them, Remain you here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the Lord may speak unto me; and the princes of Moab abode with Bil'am.
004	NUM	022	009	And God came unto Bil'am, and said, Who are these men with thee?
004	NUM	022	010	And Bil'am said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, the king of Moab, hath sent unto me, [saying,]
004	NUM	022	011	Behold, there is the people that is come out of Egypt, and covereth the face of the earth: now come, denounce it for me; peradventure I shall be able to fight against it, and drive it away.
004	NUM	022	012	And God said unto Bil'am, Thou shalt not go with them: thou shalt not curse the people; for it is blessed.
004	NUM	022	013	And Bil'am rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Go back to your land; for the Lord refuseth to give me leave to go with you.
004	NUM	022	014	And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Bil'am refuseth to come with us.
004	NUM	022	015	And Balak sent yet again princes, more in number, and more honorable than those.
004	NUM	022	016	And they came to Bil'am, and said to him, Thus hath said Balak the son of Zippor, Do not suffer thyself, I pray thee, to be prevented from coming unto me;
004	NUM	022	017	For I will honor thee greatly, and whatsoever thou mayest say unto me will I do: and only come, I pray thee, denounce me this people.
004	NUM	022	018	And Bil'am answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not transgress the order of the Lord my God, to do a small or a great thing.
004	NUM	022	019	And now, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the Lord will farther speak with me.
004	NUM	022	020	And God came unto Bil'am at night, and said unto him, If to call thee the men have come, rise up, go with them; but only the word which I shall speak unto thee, that shalt thou do.
004	NUM	022	021	And Bil'am rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.
004	NUM	022	022	And the anger of God was kindled, because he went; and an angel of the Lord placed himself in the way to be a hindrance to him; and he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.
004	NUM	022	023	And the ass saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Bil'am smote the ass, to make her turn into the way.
004	NUM	022	024	But the angel of the Lord stepped into a path between the vineyards, [with] a wall on this side, and a wall on that side.
004	NUM	022	025	And when the ass saw the angel of the Lord, she forced herself against the wall, and pressed Bil'am's foot against the wall: and he smote her again.
004	NUM	022	026	And the angel of the Lord went yet farther, and stood in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn either to the right or to the left.
004	NUM	022	027	And when the ass saw the angel of the Lord, she lay down under Bil'am: whereupon Bil'am's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a stick.
004	NUM	022	028	And the Lord opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Bil'am, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?
004	NUM	022	029	And Bil'am said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: had I but a sword in my hand, I would assuredly have now killed thee.
004	NUM	022	030	And the ass said unto Bil'am, Am not I thy ass, upon which thou hast ridden from thy commencement unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? and he said, No.
004	NUM	022	031	Then the Lord opened the eyes of Bil'am, and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head and prostrated himself on his face.
004	NUM	022	032	And the angel of the Lord said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thy ass these three times? behold, I went out to be a hindrance; because the journey which is odious to me was too quickly begun.
004	NUM	022	033	And the ass saw me, and turned aside before me these three times; if she had not turned aside from me, I would surely now not only have slain thee, but saved her alive.
004	NUM	022	034	And Bil'am said unto the angel of the Lord, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou wast standing against me in the way; but now, if it be evil in thy eyes, I will return home again.
004	NUM	022	035	And the angel of the Lord said unto Bil'am, Go with the men; however, only the word which I will speak unto thee, that shalt thou speak: and Bil'am went with the princes of Balak.
004	NUM	022	036	And when Balak heard that Bil'am was come, he went out to meet him unto 'Ir-Moab, which is on the border of Arnon, which is at the outmost end of the boundary.
004	NUM	022	037	And Balak said unto Bil'am, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to have thee called? wherefore camest thou not unto me? in truth, am I not able to honor thee?
004	NUM	022	038	And Bil'am said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee; have I now any power whatever to speak the least? the word that God may put in my mouth, that alone must I speak.
004	NUM	022	039	And Bil'am went with Balak, and they came unto Kiryath-chuzoth.
004	NUM	022	040	And Balak slew oxen and sheep, and sent to Bil'am and to the princes that were with him.
004	NUM	022	041	And it came to pass in the morning, that Balak took Bil'am, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, and he saw thence a portion of the people.
004	NUM	023	001	And Bil'am said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.
004	NUM	023	002	And Balak did as Bil'am had spoken; and Balak and Bil'am offered a bullock and a ram on every altar.
004	NUM	023	003	And Bil'am said unto Balak, Place thyself by thy burnt-offering; and I will go, peradventure the Lord will come to meet me, and whatsoever he may show me I will tell thee: and he went thoughtfully alone.
004	NUM	023	004	And God met Bil'am: and he said unto him, The seven altars have I made ready, and I have offered a bullock and a ram upon every altar.
004	NUM	023	005	And the Lord put a word in Bil'am's mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus shalt thou speak.
004	NUM	023	006	And he returned unto him, and, lo, he was standing by his burnt-offering, he, and all the princes of Moab.
004	NUM	023	007	And he took up his parable, and said, From Aram did Balak send for me, the king of Moab, out of the mountains of the east, Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel.
004	NUM	023	008	How shall I denounce, whom God hath not denounced? and how shall I defy, whom the Lord hath not defied?
004	NUM	023	009	For from the top of rocks I see him, and from hills I behold him: lo, it is a people that shall dwell alone, and among the nations it shall not be reckoned.
004	NUM	023	010	Who can count the dust of Jacob, and number the fourth part of Israel? May my soul die the death of the righteous, and may my last end be like his!
004	NUM	023	011	And Balak said unto Bil'am, What hast thou done unto me? to denounce my enemies did I take thee, and, behold, thou hast even blessed them.
004	NUM	023	012	And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that only which the Lord may put in my mouth?
004	NUM	023	013	And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from where thou canst see them; nevertheless a portion of them only wilt thou see, but the whole of them thou wilt not see: and denounce them for me from there.
004	NUM	023	014	And he brought him to the field of the watchmen, on the top of Pisgah, and he built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar.
004	NUM	023	015	And he said unto Balak, Place thyself here by thy burnt-offering, while I will repair to yonder place.
004	NUM	023	016	And the Lord met Bil'am, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus shalt thou speak.
004	NUM	023	017	And he came to him, and, behold, he was standing by his burnt-offering, and the princes of Moab with him; and Balak said unto him: What hath the Lord spoken?
004	NUM	023	018	And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; bend hither thy ear unto me, son of Zippor!
004	NUM	023	019	God is not a man, that he should lie; nor a son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? and hath he spoken, and shall he not fulfill it?
004	NUM	023	020	Behold, to bless I have received [the word]; and he hath blessed, and I cannot reverse it.
004	NUM	023	021	He hath not beheld any wrong in Jacob, nor hath he seen perverseness in Israel: the Lord his God is with him, and the glory of the king dwelleth among him.
004	NUM	023	022	God, who brought them out of Egypt, is to them like the heights of the reem.
004	NUM	023	023	For there is no enchantment in Jacob, nor is there any divination in Israel: at the proper time shall it be said to Jacob and to Israel, what God doth work.
004	NUM	023	024	Behold, it is a people, that shall rise up as a lioness, and as a lion shall it raise itself: it will not lie down until it have eaten the prey, and have drunk the blood of the slain.
004	NUM	023	025	And Balak said unto Bil'am, Neither shalt thou denounce them, nor shalt thou any wise bless them.
004	NUM	023	026	But Bil'am answered and said unto Balak, Have I not spoken unto thee, saying, all that the Lord will speak, that must I do.
004	NUM	023	027	And Balak said unto Bil'am, Come, I pray thee, I will take thee unto another place, peradventure it may be pleasing in the eyes of God that thou mayest denounce them for me from there.
004	NUM	023	028	And Balak took Bil'am unto the top of Peor, that looketh toward the desert.
004	NUM	023	029	And Bil'am said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.
004	NUM	023	030	And Balak did as Bil'am had said, and he offered a bullock and a ram on every altar.
004	NUM	024	001	And when Bil'am saw that it was pleasing in the eyes of the Lord to bless Israel, he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.
004	NUM	024	002	And Bil'am lifted up his eyes, and when he saw Israel encamped according to their tribes, there came upon him the spirit of God.
004	NUM	024	003	And he took up his parable, and said, Thus saith Bil'am the son of Beor, and thus saith the man whose eyes are open;
004	NUM	024	004	Thus saith he who heareth the sayings of God, who seeth the vision of the Almighty, falling down, with unvailed eyes:
004	NUM	024	005	How beautiful are thy tents, O Jacob, thy dwelling, O Israel!
004	NUM	024	006	As streams are they spread forth, as gardens by the river's side, as aloe-trees, which the Lord hath planted, as cedar-trees beside the waters.
004	NUM	024	007	Water runneth out of His buckets, that his seed may be moistened by abundance of water; and exalted above Agag shall be his king, and raised on high shall be his kingdom.
004	NUM	024	008	God, who brought him forth out of Egypt, is to him like the heights of the reem; he will devour nations, his oppressors, and their bones will he break, and pierce [them] through with his arrows.
004	NUM	024	009	He coucheth, he lieth down as a lion, and as a lioness: who shall make him rise up? They that bless thee be blessed, and they that curse thee be cursed.
004	NUM	024	010	And the anger of Balak was kindled against Bil'am, and he struck his hands together: and Balak said unto Bil'am, To denounce my enemies did I call thee, and, behold, thou hast even blessed them these three times.
004	NUM	024	011	And now flee thou to thy place: I thought to honor thee greatly; but, lo, the Lord hath kept thee back from honor.
004	NUM	024	012	And Bil'am said unto Balak, Did I not already speak to thy messengers, whom thou sentest unto me, saying,
004	NUM	024	013	If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not transgress the order of the Lord, to do good or evil out of my own heart: what the Lord will speak, that must I speak?
004	NUM	024	014	And now, behold, I am going unto my people: come, I will advise thee against what this people will do to thy people in the end of days.
004	NUM	024	015	And he took up his parable and said, Thus saith Bil'am the son of Beor, and thus saith the man whose eyes are open;
004	NUM	024	016	Thus saith he who heareth the sayings of God, and knoweth the knowledge of the Most High, who seeth the vision of the Almighty, falling down, with unvailed eyes:
004	NUM	024	017	I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not nigh; there steppeth forth a star out of Jacob, and there ariseth a sceptre out of Israel, and he pierceth the chiefs of Moab, and destroyeth all the children of Sheth.
004	NUM	024	018	And Edom shall be a conquest, and Seir shall be a conquest for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.
004	NUM	024	019	And there shall rule the one from Jacob, and he shall destroy whatever escapeth out of the city.
004	NUM	024	020	And he looked on Amalek, and he took up his parable, and said, The first of nations is Amalek; but his latter end shall be destruction for ever.
004	NUM	024	021	And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwelling-place, and placed on the rock is thy nest.
004	NUM	024	022	Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted: whither will Asshur carry thee away captive?
004	NUM	024	023	And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God doth appoint this one?
004	NUM	024	024	But ships will come from the coast of Kittim, and will afflict Asshur, and will afflict 'Eber; and he also will be given to destruction for ever.
004	NUM	024	025	And Bil'am rose up, and went and returned to his place; and Balak also went his way.
004	NUM	025	001	And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit incest with the daughters of Moab.
004	NUM	025	002	And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods: and the people did eat, and bowed themselves down to their gods.
004	NUM	025	003	And Israel joined themselves unto Baal-peor; and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel.
004	NUM	025	004	And the Lord said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and [cause them to] hang the [guilty] up before the Lord, in the face of the sun, that the fierce anger of the Lord may be turned away from Israel.
004	NUM	025	005	And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that have been joined unto Baal-peor.
004	NUM	025	006	And, behold, one of the children of Israel came, and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman, before the eyes of Moses, and before the eyes of all the congregation of the children of Israel, and these were weeping by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
004	NUM	025	007	And when Phinehas, the son of Elazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from the midst of the congregation, and took a javelin in his hand;
004	NUM	025	008	And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her body: and the plague was stayed from the children of Israel.
004	NUM	025	009	And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand.
004	NUM	025	010	And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
004	NUM	025	011	Phinehas, the son of Elazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned away my wrath from the children of Israel, while he was zealous in my stead in the midst of them, that I consumed not the children of Israel in my indignation.
004	NUM	025	012	Therefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace;
004	NUM	025	013	And it shall be unto him and unto his seed after him a covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel.
004	NUM	025	014	Now the name of the man of Israel that was slain, who was slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Sahlu, a prince of a family division among the Simeonites.
004	NUM	025	015	And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head of tribes, of a family division in Midian.
004	NUM	025	016	And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
004	NUM	025	017	Attack the Midianites and smite them;
004	NUM	025	018	For they are enemies unto you with their wiles, wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, who was slain on the day of the plague for the sake of Peor.
004	NUM	026	001	And it came to pass after the plague, That the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Elazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,
004	NUM	026	002	Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, by the descent from their fathers, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel.
004	NUM	026	003	And Moses with El'azar the priest spoke with them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan opposite Jericho, saying,
004	NUM	026	004	[Take the sum of the people,] from twenty years old and upward; as the Lord commanded Moses and the children of Israel, who went forth out of the land of Egypt.

# BOOK	005	DEU	Deuteronomy	Deuteronomy
005	DEU	001	001	These are the words which Moses spoke unto all Israel on this side of the Jordan, in the wilderness, in the plain opposite Suph, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Chazeroth, and Di-zahab.
005	DEU	001	002	It is a journey of eleven days from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadesh-barnea'.
005	DEU	001	003	And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke unto the children of Israel, according to all that the Lord had commanded him concerning them;
005	DEU	001	004	After he had smitten Sichon the king of the Emorites, who dwelt in Cheshbon, and 'Og the king of Bashan, who dwelt at 'Ashtaroth in Edre'i.
005	DEU	001	005	On this side of the Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to explain this law, saying,
005	DEU	001	006	The Lord our God spoke unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have tarried long enough at this mount;
005	DEU	001	007	Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mountain of the Emorites, and unto all its neighboring places, in the plain, in the mountain, and in the lowlands, and in the southern country, and by the coast of the sea, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto the Lebanon, up to the great river, the river Euphrates.
005	DEU	001	008	Behold, I have given up the land before you: go in and take possession of the land which the Lord hath sworn unto your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give it unto them and to their seed after them.
005	DEU	001	009	And I said unto you at that time, as followeth, I am not able alone to bear you:
005	DEU	001	010	The Lord your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.
005	DEU	001	011	May the Lord the God of your fathers make you a thousand times as many more as ye are; and bless you, as he hath spoken unto you.
005	DEU	001	012	How can I by myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife!
005	DEU	001	013	Furnish for yourselves wise and understanding men, and those known among your tribes, and I will place them as chiefs over you.
005	DEU	001	014	And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good to do.
005	DEU	001	015	And I took the chiefs of your tribes, wise and known men, and I set them as heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and as officers for your tribes.
005	DEU	001	016	And I commanded your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously, between a man and his brother, and between his stranger.
005	DEU	001	017	Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; the small as well as the great shall ye hear; ye shall not be afraid of any man; for the judgment belongeth to God: and the cause that is too hard for you shall ye bring unto me, and I will hear it.
005	DEU	001	018	And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.
005	DEU	001	019	And we departed from Horeb, and we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye have seen, by the way of the mountain of the Emorites, as the Lord our God had commanded us; and we came as far as Kadesh-barnea'.
005	DEU	001	020	And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Emorites, which the Lord our God doth give unto us.
005	DEU	001	021	Behold, the Lord thy God hath given up the land before thee: go up and take possession of it, as the Lord the God of thy fathers hath spoken unto thee; do not fear, and be not discouraged.
005	DEU	001	022	And ye all came near unto me and said, Let us send out men before us, that they may search out for us the land, and bring us word again concerning the way by which we must go up, and the cities to which we shall come.
005	DEU	001	023	And the thing was pleasing in my eyes; and I took of you twelve men, one man for every tribe:
005	DEU	001	024	And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out.
005	DEU	001	025	And they took in their hand some of the fruit of the land, and brought it down unto us; and they brought us word again, and said, The land which the Lord our God doth give us is good.
005	DEU	001	026	But you would not go up, and ye rebelled against the order of the Lord your God;
005	DEU	001	027	And ye murmured in your tents, and said, On account of the hatred of the Lord toward us, hath he brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Emorites, to destroy us.
005	DEU	001	028	Whither shall we go up? our brethren have made faint our heart, saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and fortified up to heaven; and moreover the sons of the 'Anakim have we seen there.
005	DEU	001	029	And I said unto you, Have no dread, nor be ye afraid of them.
005	DEU	001	030	The Lord your God who goeth before you, he it is who will fight for you; all just as he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;
005	DEU	001	031	And in the wilderness which thou hast seen, where the Lord thy God bore thee, as a man doth bear his son, on all the way that ye have gone, until ye came unto this place.
005	DEU	001	032	Yet in this thing do ye not believe in the Lord your God,
005	DEU	001	033	Who goeth before you on the way to seek out for you a place for your encamping, in fire by night, to cause you to see on the way in which ye are to go, and in a cloud by day.
005	DEU	001	034	And the Lord heard the voice of your words; and he was wroth, and swore, saying,
005	DEU	001	035	Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I have sworn to give unto your fathers;
005	DEU	001	036	Save Caleb the son of Yephunneh, he shall see it, and to him will I give the land upon which he hath trodden, and to his children; because he hath wholly followed the Lord.
005	DEU	001	037	also with me was the Lord angry for your sakes, saying, also thou shalt not go in thither.
005	DEU	001	038	Joshua the son of Nun, who standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: him encourage; for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.
005	DEU	001	039	And your little ones, of whom ye said, They will become a prey, and your children who know not this day either good or evil, these shall go in thither; and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.
005	DEU	001	040	But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.
005	DEU	001	041	And ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the Lord; we indeed will go up and we will fight, according to all that the Lord our God hath commanded us; and ye girded on every man his weapons of war, and ye insisted to go up into the mountain.
005	DEU	001	042	And the Lord said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, and do not fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.
005	DEU	001	043	And I spoke unto you; but ye would not hear; and ye rebelled against the order of the Lord, and you were presumptuous, and went up into the mountain.
005	DEU	001	044	And the Emorites, who dwelt in that mountain: came out against you, and they pursued you, as the bees do, and they overthrew you in Seir, as far as Chormah.
005	DEU	001	045	And ye returned and wept before the Lord; but the Lord hearkened not to your voice, nor gave ear unto you.
005	DEU	001	046	And ye tarried in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye tarried there.
005	DEU	002	001	Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea, as the Lord had spoken unto me: and we traveled around mount Seir many days.
005	DEU	002	002	And the Lord said unto me, as followeth,
005	DEU	002	003	Ye have traveled long enough around this mountain; turn yourselves northward.
005	DEU	002	004	And the people command thou, saying, Ye are passing by the border of your brethren the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you; therefore take ye good heed unto yourselves;
005	DEU	002	005	Do not contend with them; for I will not give unto you of their land, even so much as a foot's breadth; because unto Esau have I given mount Seir for an inheritance.
005	DEU	002	006	Food shall ye buy of them for money, that ye may eat; and water also shall ye buy of them for money, that ye may drink.
005	DEU	002	007	For the Lord thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand; he hath provided for thy wandering through this great wilderness: these forty years the Lord thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.
005	DEU	002	008	And we passed away from our brethren the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, from the way through the plain, from Elath, and from 'Ezyon-gaber. And we turned and passed the way of the wilderness of Moab.
005	DEU	002	009	And the Lord said unto me, Do not attack the Moabites, nor contend with them in battle; for I will not give thee from their land any inheritance, because unto the children of Lot have I given 'Ar for an inheritance.
005	DEU	002	010	The Emim in times past dwelt therein, a people great, and numerous, and tall as the 'Anakim;
005	DEU	002	011	As Rephaim were also they accounted, equally with the 'Anakim; and the Moabites called the[m] Emim.
005	DEU	002	012	And in Seir dwelt the Chorim in times past; but the children of Esau drove them out, and they destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel hath done unto the land of his inheritance, which the Lord hath given unto them.
005	DEU	002	013	Now rise up, and get you over the brook Zered; and we passed over the brook Zered.
005	DEU	002	014	And the time which we came from Kadesh-barnea', until we had passed over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were spent from out the midst of the camp, as the Lord had sworn unto them.
005	DEU	002	015	And also the hand of the Lord was against them, to destroy them from the midst of the camp; until they were spent.
005	DEU	002	016	So it came to pass, when all the men of war were spent by, dying from the midst of the people,
005	DEU	002	017	That the Lord spoke unto me, saying,
005	DEU	002	018	Thou art passing this day by the border of Moab, by 'Ar,
005	DEU	002	019	And thou comest nigh opposite the children of 'Ammon: do not attack them, nor contend with them; for I will not give unto thee of the land of the children of 'Ammon any inheritance; because unto the children of Lot have I given it for an inheritance.
005	DEU	002	020	As the land of Rephaim was it also accounted: Rephaim dwelt therein in times past; and the 'Ammonites called them Zamzummim;
005	DEU	002	021	A people great, and numerous, and tall, as the 'Anakim; but the Lord destroyed them before them; and they drove them out, and dwelt in their stead:
005	DEU	002	022	As he hath done to the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, from before whom he destroyed the Chorim; and they drove them out and dwelt in their stead, even unto this day.
005	DEU	002	023	And the 'Avvim, who dwelt in open towns, as far as unto Gazzah, —the Caphtorim, who came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.
005	DEU	002	024	Rise ye up, set forward, and pass over the brook Arnon; behold I have given into thy hand Sichon the king of Cheshbon, the Emorite, and his land: begin to drive him out, and contend with him in battle.
005	DEU	002	025	This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven; whoever will hear the report of thee, shall tremble, and shall quake because of thee.
005	DEU	002	026	And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sichon, the king of Cheshbon, with words of peace, saying,
005	DEU	002	027	Let me pass through thy land: always by the highway will I go along; I will not turn unto the right hand or unto the left.
005	DEU	002	028	Food shalt thou sell me for money, that I may eat; and water for money shalt thou give me, that I may drink: only let me pass through on foot;
005	DEU	002	029	(As the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites who dwell in 'Ar, have done unto me:) until that I shall pass over the Jordan into the land which the Lord our God giveth us.
005	DEU	002	030	But Sichon, the king of Cheshbon, would not suffer our passing by him; for the Lord thy God had hardened his spirit, and had made obstinate his heart, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as [hath happened] this day.
005	DEU	002	031	And the Lord said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give up Sichon and his land before thee: begin to drive him out, that thou mayest inherit his land.
005	DEU	002	032	And Sichon came out against us, he and all his people, to the battle at Yahaz.
005	DEU	002	033	And the Lord our God gave him up before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.
005	DEU	002	034	And we conquered all his cities at that time, and devoted every inhabited city, and the women, and the little ones; we left none that escaped.
005	DEU	002	035	Only the cattle we took as booty unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we had captured.
005	DEU	002	036	From 'Aro'er, which is by the bank of the brook of Arnon, and the city that is in the brook, even unto Gil'ad, there was not one city which was too strong for us; the whole did the Lord our God give up before us.
005	DEU	002	037	Only unto the land of the children of 'Ammon didst thou not come nigh, unto the whole margin of the brook Yabbok, and the cities in the mountain, and unto whatsoever the Lord our God had forbidden us.
005	DEU	003	001	And we turned, and went up the way to Bashan; and 'Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to the battle at Edre'i.
005	DEU	003	002	And the Lord said unto me, Fear him not; for into thy hand have I given him, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do unto him as thou hast done unto Sichon, the king of the Emorites, who dwelt at Cheshbon.
005	DEU	003	003	And the Lord our God gave into our hands also 'Og the king of Bashan, and all his people; and we smote him until none was left to him who escaped.
005	DEU	003	004	And we conquered all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of 'Og in Bashan.
005	DEU	003	005	all these were fortified cities, with high walls, gates, and bars; besides the unwalled towns, which were a great many.
005	DEU	003	006	And we devoted them, as we had done unto Sichon the king of Cheshbon, devoting every inhabited city, the women, and the little ones.
005	DEU	003	007	But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took as booty to ourselves.
005	DEU	003	008	And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Emorites the land which is on this side of the Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Chermon;
005	DEU	003	009	(The Sidonians call Chermon Siryon; and the Emorites call it Senir;)
005	DEU	003	010	All the cities of the plain, and all Gil'ad, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, the cities of the kingdom of 'Og in Bashan.
005	DEU	003	011	For only 'Og the king of Bashan had been left of the remnant of the Rephaim; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; lo! it is in Rabbah of the children of 'Ammon: nine cubits is its length, and four cubits its breadth, after the arm of a man.
005	DEU	003	012	And of this land, of which we took possession at that time, from 'Aro'er, which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gil'ad, and the cities thereof, I gave unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.
005	DEU	003	013	And the rest of Gil'ad, and all Bashan, the kingdom of 'Og, I gave unto the half tribe of Menasseh: all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, this is called the land of Rephaim.
005	DEU	003	014	Yair the son of Menasseh took all the region of Argob up to the border of the Geshurites and the Ma-'achathites; and he called them the [land of] Bashan, after his own name, the villages of Yair, unto this day.
005	DEU	003	015	And unto Machir I gave Gil'ad.
005	DEU	003	016	And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gil'ad even unto the brook Arnon, the land within the river and that adjoining, even unto the brook Yabbok, the border of the children of 'Ammon;
005	DEU	003	017	The plain also, and the Jordan, and the adjoining land, from Kinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, the Salt Sea, under the declivities of Pisgah, eastward.
005	DEU	003	018	And I commanded you at that time, saying, The Lord your God hath given you this land to possess it: armed shall ye pass over before your brethren the children of Israel, all that are fit to bear arms.
005	DEU	003	019	But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;
005	DEU	003	020	Until that the Lord have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and they also have taken possession of the land which the Lord your God giveth them beyond the Jordan: then shall ye return every man unto his possession which I have given you.
005	DEU	003	021	And Joshua also I commanded at that time, saying, Thy own eyes have seen all that the Lord your God hath done unto these two kings: thus will the Lord do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.
005	DEU	003	022	Ye shall not fear them; for the Lord your God it is who fighteth for you.
005	DEU	003	023	And I besought the Lord at that time, saying,
005	DEU	003	024	O Lord Eternal, thou hast begun to show thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand; for what God is there in heaven or on earth, that can do aught like thy works, and like thy mighty deeds?
005	DEU	003	025	Let me go over, I pray thee, that I may see the good land which is on the other side of the Jordan, this goodly mountain, and the Lebanon.
005	DEU	003	026	But the Lord was wroth with me for your sakes, and he would not hear me: and the Lord said unto me, Let it suffice thee; do not continue to speak unto me any more of this matter.
005	DEU	003	027	Get thee up unto the top of Pisgah, and lift up thy eyes, westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it with thy eyes; for thou shalt not pass over this Jordan.
005	DEU	003	028	And do thou charge Joshua, and strengthen him, and encourage him; for he shall go over before this people, and he shall divide out to them the land which thou shalt see.
005	DEU	003	029	And we abode in the valley opposite Beth-peor.
005	DEU	004	001	And now, O Israel, hearken unto the statutes and unto the ordinances which I teach you to do; in order that ye may live, and go in and take possession of the land which the Lord, the God of your fathers, giveth unto you.
005	DEU	004	002	Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, nor shall ye diminish aught from it; that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you.
005	DEU	004	003	Your own eyes have seen that which the Lord hath done because of Baal-peor; for every man that followed Baal-peor, him the Lord thy God hath destroyed from the midst of thee.
005	DEU	004	004	But ye that did cleave unto the Lord your God, are alive, every one of you, this day.
005	DEU	004	005	See, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, just as the Lord my God commanded me; that ye may do so in the midst of the land whither ye go to take possession of it.
005	DEU	004	006	Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding before the eyes of the nations, that shall hear all these statutes, and they will say, Nothing but a wise and understanding people is this great nation.
005	DEU	004	007	For what great nation is there that hath gods so nigh unto it, as is the Lord our God at all times that we call upon him.
005	DEU	004	008	And what great nation is there that hath statutes and ordinances so righteous as is all this law, which I lay before you this day?
005	DEU	004	009	Only take heed to thyself, and guard thy soul diligently, that thou do not forget the things which thy eyes have seen, and that they depart not from thy heart all the days of thy life; but thou shalt make them known unto thy sons, and unto thy sons' sons;
005	DEU	004	010	The day that thou stoodest before the Lord thy God at Horeb, when the Lord said unto me, Assemble for me the people, and I will cause them to hear my words, which they shall learn, to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and which they shall teach their children.
005	DEU	004	011	And ye came near and stood at the foot of the mount; and the mount was burning with fire unto the midst of the heaven, [from amidst] darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.
005	DEU	004	012	And the Lord spoke unto you out of the midst of the fire; the sound of words ye heard, but any similitude ye saw not: there was nothing but a sound.
005	DEU	004	013	And he told unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, the ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.
005	DEU	004	014	And me the Lord commanded at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it.
005	DEU	004	015	Take ye therefore good heed of your souls; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the Lord spoke unto you at Horeb out of the midst of the fire:
005	DEU	004	016	That ye become not corrupt, and make yourselves a graven image, the similitude of any idol-figure, the likeness of a male or of a female,
005	DEU	004	017	The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air of heaven,
005	DEU	004	018	The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth;
005	DEU	004	019	And that thou lift not up thy eyes unto the heavens, and thou see the sun, and the moon, and the stars, all the host of heaven, and be misled to bow down to them, and to serve them, those which the Lord thy God hath assigned unto all nations under the whole heaven.
005	DEU	004	020	But you did the Lord take, and he brought you forth out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be unto you a people of inheritance, as ye are this day.
005	DEU	004	021	Farthermore the Lord was angry with me for your sakes, and he swore that I should not go over the Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land, which the Lord thy God giveth unto thee for an inheritance;
005	DEU	004	022	For I must die in this land; I shall not go over the Jordan; but ye will go over and take possession of this good land.
005	DEU	004	023	Take heed unto yourselves, that ye do not forget the covenant of the Lord your God, which he hath made with you, and make yourselves a graven image, the likeness of any thing, which the Lord thy God hath forbidden thee.
005	DEU	004	024	For the Lord thy God is a consuming fire; yea, a watchful God.
005	DEU	004	025	When thou begettest children, and children's children, and ye shall have remained long in the land, and ye become corrupt, and make a graven image, the likeness of any thing, and do the evil in the eyes of the Lord thy God, to provoke him to anger:
005	DEU	004	026	I call this day the heavens and the earth to witness against you, that ye shall soon perish from off the land whereunto ye go over the Jordan to possess it; ye shall not remain many days upon it, but ye shall surely be destroyed.
005	DEU	004	027	And the Lord will scatter you among the nations, and ye will be left few in number among the nations, whither the Lord will lead you.
005	DEU	004	028	And ye will serve there gods, the work of man's hands, wood and stone, which neither can see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.
005	DEU	004	029	But thou wilt seek from there the Lord thy God, and wilt find him, if thou apply to him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.
005	DEU	004	030	When thou art in tribulation, and all these things have overtaken thee, in the latter end of days: then wilt thou return to the Lord thy God, and be obedient unto his voice.
005	DEU	004	031	For a merciful God is the Lord thy God; he will not forsake thee, nor destroy thee; and he will not forget the covenant of thy fathers which he hath sworn unto them.
005	DEU	004	032	For do but ask of former days, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and from the one end of the heavens unto the other end of the heavens, whether there hath been the like of this great thing, or whether the like of it hath been heard.
005	DEU	004	033	Hath ever a people heard the voice of a god, speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and remained alive?
005	DEU	004	034	Or hath a god essayed to go to take himself a nation from the midst of a nation, by proofs, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, like all that which the Lord your God hath done for you in Egypt before thy eyes.
005	DEU	004	035	Unto thee it was shown, that thou mightest know, that the Eternal is the God: there is none else besides him.
005	DEU	004	036	Out of the heavens he caused thee to hear his voice, to correct thee: and upon the earth he caused thee to see his great fire; and his words didst thou hear out of the midst of the fire.
005	DEU	004	037	And therefore, because he loved thy fathers, he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out in his presence with his mighty power out of Egypt;
005	DEU	004	038	To drive out nations greater and mightier than thou art, from before thee, to bring thee in, to give unto thee their land for an inheritance, as it is this day.
005	DEU	004	039	Know therefore this day, and reflect in thy heart, that the Eternal is the God in the heavens above, and upon the earth beneath: there is none else.
005	DEU	004	040	And thou shalt keep his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee; and that thou mayest live many days upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, for all times.
005	DEU	004	041	Then Moses set aside three cities on this side of the Jordan, toward the rising of the sun;
005	DEU	004	042	That thither might flee the manslayer, who should kill his neighbor unawares, when he had not been an enemy to him in times past; and that he should flee unto one of these cities and live.
005	DEU	004	043	Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, for the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gil'ad for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan for the Menassites.
005	DEU	004	044	And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:
005	DEU	004	045	These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which Moses spoke unto the children of Israel, when they came forth out of Egypt,
005	DEU	004	046	On this side of the Jordan, in the valley opposite to Beth-peor, in the land of Sichon the king of the Emorites, who dwelt at Cheshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they were come forth out of Egypt;
005	DEU	004	047	And they took possession of his land, and of the land of 'Og the king of Bashan, the two kings of the Emorites, who were on this side of the Jordan toward the rising of the sun;
005	DEU	004	048	From 'Aro'er, which is on the bank of the river Arnon, even unto mount Sion, which is Chermon,
005	DEU	004	049	And all the plain on this side of the Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the plain, under the declivities of Pisgah.
005	DEU	005	001	And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and the ordinances which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and that ye may observe to do them.
005	DEU	005	002	The Lord our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.
005	DEU	005	003	Not with our fathers did the Lord make this covenant, but with us, we who are here all of us alive this day.
005	DEU	005	004	Face to face did the Lord speak with you on the mount, out of the midst of the fire,
005	DEU	005	005	(I was standing between the Lord and between you at that time, to announce to you the word of the Lord; for ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and ye went not up into the mount;) saying,
005	DEU	005	006	I am the Lord thy God, who have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery.
005	DEU	005	007	Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
005	DEU	005	008	Thou shalt not make unto thyself any graven image, any likeness of any thing that is in the heavens above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:
005	DEU	005	009	Thou shalt not bow thyself down unto them, nor serve them; for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the third and upon the fourth generation of them that hate me,
005	DEU	005	010	And showing kindness unto the thousandth generation of them that love me, and keep my commandments.
005	DEU	005	011	Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.
005	DEU	005	012	Keep the sabbath-day to sanctify it, as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee.
005	DEU	005	013	Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work;
005	DEU	005	014	But the seventh day is the sabbath in honor of the Lord thy God; on it thou shalt not do any work, neither thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy ox, nor thy ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: in order that thy man-servant and thy maid-servant may rest as well as thou.
005	DEU	005	015	And thou shalt remember that thou hast been a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the Lord thy God brought thee out from there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm; therefore hath the Lord thy God commanded thee to observe the sabbath-day.
005	DEU	005	016	Honor thy father and thy mother, as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee: in order that thy days may be prolonged, and in order that it may go well with thee, in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.
005	DEU	005	017	Thou shalt not kill.
005	DEU	005	018	Neither shalt thou commit adultery.
005	DEU	005	019	Neither shalt thou steal.
005	DEU	005	020	Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbor.
005	DEU	005	021	Neither shalt thou covet thy neighbor's wife. Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbor's house, nor his field, nor his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbor's.
005	DEU	005	022	These words did the Lord speak unto all your assembly on the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice, but he did so no more; and he wrote them on two tables of stone, and he gave them unto me.
005	DEU	005	023	And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, while the mount was burning with fire, that ye came near unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;
005	DEU	005	024	And ye said, Behold, the Lord our God hath caused us to see his glory and his greatness, and his voice have we heard out of the midst of the fire: this day have we seen that God can speak with man, who nevertheless may live.
005	DEU	005	025	But now why should we die? for this great fire may consume us; if we continue to hear the voice of the Lord our God any more, then shall we die.
005	DEU	005	026	For where is there any flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, like us, and hath remained alive?
005	DEU	005	027	Do thou approach, and hear all that the Lord our God may say; and thou shalt speak unto us all that the Lord our God may speak unto thee; and we will hear and do it.
005	DEU	005	028	And the Lord heard the voice of your words, while ye were speaking unto me; and the Lord said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee: they have done well in all that they have spoken.
005	DEU	005	029	Who would grant that this their heart might remain in them, to fear me, and to keep all my commandments at all times; in order that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever!
005	DEU	005	030	Go, say to them, Return you unto your tents.
005	DEU	005	031	But as for thee, remain thou here by me, and I will speak unto thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it.
005	DEU	005	032	Observe ye then to do as the Lord your God hath commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right or to the left.
005	DEU	005	033	altogether in the way, which the Lord your God hath commanded you, shall ye walk; in order that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and that ye may remain many days in the land which ye will possess.
005	DEU	006	001	And this is the commandment, with the statutes, and the ordinances, which the Lord your God hath commanded to teach you, to do them in the land whither ye are passing over to possess it:
005	DEU	006	002	In order that you mayest fear the Lord thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command thee, thou and thy son, and thy son's son, all the days of thy life; and in order that thy days may be prolonged.
005	DEU	006	003	Hear, therefore, O Israel, and observe to do them; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase greatly, as the Lord the God of thy fathers hath spoken to thee, [in] the land flowing with milk and honey.
005	DEU	006	004	Hear, O Israel! The Lord, our God, is the One Eternal Being.
005	DEU	006	005	And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.
005	DEU	006	006	And these words which I command thee this day, shall be in thy heart:
005	DEU	006	007	And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and thou shalt speak of them when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.
005	DEU	006	008	And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thy eyes.
005	DEU	006	009	And thou shalt write them upon the door-posts of thy house, and upon thy gates.
005	DEU	006	010	And it shall be, when the Lord thy God shall bring thee into the land which he hath sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give unto thee, great and goodly cities, which thou didst not build,
005	DEU	006	011	And houses full of all good things, which thou didst not fill, and wells hewed out which thou didst not hew, vineyards and olive-trees, which thou didst not plant; and thou hast eaten and art satisfied:
005	DEU	006	012	Then beware that thou do not forget the Lord, who hath brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery.
005	DEU	006	013	The Lord thy God shalt thou fear, and him shalt thou serve, and by his name shalt thou swear.
005	DEU	006	014	Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the nations which are round about you;
005	DEU	006	015	For the Lord thy God is a watchful God among you: so that the anger of the Lord thy God may not be kindled against thee, and he destroy thee from off the face of the earth.
005	DEU	006	016	Ye shall not tempt the Lord your God, as ye tempted him in Massah.
005	DEU	006	017	Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the Lord your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee.
005	DEU	006	018	And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the eyes of the Lord; in order that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and take possession of the good land which the Lord hath sworn unto thy fathers,
005	DEU	006	019	To cast out all thy enemies from before thee; as the Lord hath spoken.
005	DEU	006	020	When thy son should ask thee in time to come, saying, What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which the Lord our God hath commanded you?
005	DEU	006	021	Then shalt thou say unto thy son, We were bondmen unto Pharaoh in Egypt; and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand;
005	DEU	006	022	And the Lord let come signs and wonders, great and sore, on Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on all his household, before our eyes;
005	DEU	006	023	And us he brought out from there; in order to bring us in, to give us the land which he had sworn unto our fathers.
005	DEU	006	024	And the Lord commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the Lord our God; that it might be well with us at all times, and that he might preserve us alive, as it is at this day.
005	DEU	006	025	And it shall be accounted righteousness unto us, if we observe to do all this commandment before the Lord our God, as he hath commanded us.
005	DEU	007	001	When the Lord thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and cast out many nations before thee, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Emorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations, greater in number and mightier than thou;
005	DEU	007	002	And when the Lord thy God shall give them up before thee, and thou dost smite them: thou shalt utterly destroy them; thou shalt not make any covenant with them, nor show mercy unto them.
005	DEU	007	003	Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughters shalt thou not give unto his son, and his daughter shalt thou not take unto thy son.
005	DEU	007	004	For he would turn away thy son from following me, so that they might serve other gods; and the anger of the Lord would be kindled against you, and he would destroy thee speedily.
005	DEU	007	005	But thus shall ye do unto them: their altars shall ye pull down, and their statues shall ye break, and their groves shall ye cut down, and their graven images shall ye burn with fire.
005	DEU	007	006	For thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God; of thee the Lord thy God hath made choice to be unto himself a special people, above all the nations that are upon the face of the earth.
005	DEU	007	007	Not because ye are more in number than all the nations, did the Lord desire you and make choice of you; for ye are the fewest of all the nations;
005	DEU	007	008	But on account of the love of the Lord for you, and because he keepeth the oath which he hath sworn unto your fathers, hath the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bond-men, out of the hand of Pharaoh the king of Egypt.
005	DEU	007	009	Know then that the Eternal thy God, is the God, the faithful God, who keepeth the covenant and the mercy with those that love him and with those that keep his commandments to the thousandth generation;
005	DEU	007	010	And repayeth those that hate him to their face, to destroy them; he will not delay to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face.
005	DEU	007	011	Therefore shalt thou keep the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which I command thee this day, to do them.
005	DEU	007	012	And it shall come to pass in reward for that ye will hearken to these ordinances, and keep, and do them, that the Lord thy God will keep unto thee the covenant and the kindness which he hath sworn unto thy fathers:
005	DEU	007	013	And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee; and he will bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy wine, and thy oil, the increase of thy cattle, and the young of thy flocks, in the land which he hath sworn unto thy fathers to give unto thee.
005	DEU	007	014	Blessed shalt thou be above all the nations; there shall not be a barren male or female among thee, nor among thy cattle.
005	DEU	007	015	And the Lord will take away from thee all sickness; and all the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, will he not put upon thee; but he will lay them upon all those that hate thee.
005	DEU	007	016	And thou shalt consume all the nations which the Lord thy God giveth unto thee; thy eye shall not look with pity upon them: and thou shalt not serve their gods; for that would be a snare unto thee.
005	DEU	007	017	If thou shouldst say in thy heart, These nations are more numerous than I: how shall I be able to dispossess them?
005	DEU	007	018	Thou shalt not be afraid of them; [but] thou shalt well remember what the Lord thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt;
005	DEU	007	019	The great proofs which thy eyes have seen, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm, whereby the Lord thy God brought thee out: in this wise will the Lord thy God do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid.
005	DEU	007	020	Moreover the hornet will the Lord thy God send out against them, until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed.
005	DEU	007	021	Thou shalt not be affrighted at them; for the Lord thy God is in the midst of thee, a mighty and terrible God.
005	DEU	007	022	And the Lord thy God will chase out these nations before thee, little by little: thou shalt not be able to make an end of them speedily, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee.
005	DEU	007	023	And the Lord thy God will give them up before thee, and he will bring among them a mighty confusion, until they be destroyed.
005	DEU	007	024	And he will give their kings into thy hand, and thou shalt destroy their name from under the heavens: no man shall be able to stand up before thee, until thou have destroyed them.
005	DEU	007	025	The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not covet the silver or gold that is on them, so that thou wouldst take it unto thyself, lest thou be ensnared thereby; for it is an abomination to the Lord thy God.
005	DEU	007	026	And thou shalt not bring an abomination into thy house, lest thou become accursed like it: thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is accursed.
005	DEU	008	001	All the commandment which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do; in order that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and take possession of the land which the Lord hath sworn unto your fathers.
005	DEU	008	002	And thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God hath led thee these forty years in the wilderness, in order to afflict thee, to prove thee, to know what is in thy heart, whether thou wouldst keep his commandments, or not.
005	DEU	008	003	And he afflicted thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and he gave thee manna to eat, which thou knewest not, and which thy fathers had not known; in order that he might make thee know that not by bread alone man doth live, but by every thing that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth man live.
005	DEU	008	004	Thy garment did not fall worn out from thee, and thy foot did not swell, these forty years.
005	DEU	008	005	And thou shalt consider in thy heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, so doth the Lord thy God chasten thee.
005	DEU	008	006	And thou shalt keep the commandments of the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.
005	DEU	008	007	For the Lord thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and mountains;
005	DEU	008	008	A land of wheat, and barley, and of the vine, and the fig-tree, and the pomegranate; a land of the oil-olive, and of honey;
005	DEU	008	009	A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, wherein thou shalt not lack anything; a land the stones whereof are iron, and out of the mountains of which thou canst hew copper.
005	DEU	008	010	And when thou hast eaten and art satisfied, then shalt thou bless the Lord thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.
005	DEU	008	011	Take heed unto thyself that thou forget not the Lord thy God, so as not to keep his commandments, and his ordinances, and his statutes, which I command thee this day;
005	DEU	008	012	That when thou hast eaten and art satisfied, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt therein;
005	DEU	008	013	And when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold are multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied:
005	DEU	008	014	Thy heart be then not lifted up, and thou forget the Lord thy God, who hath brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery;
005	DEU	008	015	Who hath led thee through the great and terrible wilderness, wherein are snakes, poisonous serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there is no water; who hath brought forth for thee water out of the flinty rock;
005	DEU	008	016	Who hath fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not; in order to afflict thee, and in order to prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end;
005	DEU	008	017	And thou say in thy heart, My power and the strength of my hand have gotten me this wealth.
005	DEU	008	018	But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God; for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth; in order that he might fulfill his covenant which he hath sworn unto thy fathers, as it is this day.
005	DEU	008	019	And it shall come to pass, that, if thou shouldst forget the Lord thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and bow thyself down to them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish;
005	DEU	008	020	Like the nations which the Lord destroyeth from before you, so shall ye perish; in recompense of that ye would not hearken unto the voice of the Lord your God.
005	DEU	009	001	Hear, O Israel: Thou art to pass this day over the Jordan, to go in to drive out nations greater and mightier than thou, [to conquer] cities great and fortified up to heaven,
005	DEU	009	002	A people great and tall, the children of the 'Anakim, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand before the children of 'Anak!
005	DEU	009	003	Understand therefore this day, that the Lord thy God it is who goeth over before thee, he is a consuming fire; he will destroy them, and he will subdue them before thy face; and thou wilt drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the Lord hath spoken unto thee.
005	DEU	009	004	Thou must not say in thy heart, when the Lord thy God doth cast them out from before thee, as followeth, For my righteousness hath the Lord brought me in to possess this land; and that for the wickedness of these nations the Lord doth drive them out from before thee.
005	DEU	009	005	Not for thy righteousness, nor for the uprightness of thy heart, dost thou go in to possess their land; but for the wickedness of these nations doth the Lord thy God drive them out from before thee, and in order that he may fulfill the word which the Lord hath sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
005	DEU	009	006	And thou shalt know, that not for thy righteousness doth the Lord thy God give unto thee this good land to possess it; for thou art a stiff-necked people.
005	DEU	009	007	Remember, do not forget, how thou didst provoke the Lord thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou wentest out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, have ye been rebellious against the Lord.
005	DEU	009	008	Also at Horeb ye provoked the Lord to wrath, so that the Lord was angry with you to destroy you.
005	DEU	009	009	When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, the tables of the covenant which the Lord had made with you, and I abode on the mount forty days and forty nights, bread did I not eat, and water did I not drink.
005	DEU	009	010	And the Lord gave unto me the two tables of stone inscribed by the finger of God; and on them [was written] according to all the words, which the Lord had spoken with you on the mount out of the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly.
005	DEU	009	011	And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the Lord gave unto me the two tables of stone, the tables of the covenant.
005	DEU	009	012	And the Lord said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from here; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have become corrupted; they have quickly turned aside out of the way which I have commanded them; they have made themselves a molten image.
005	DEU	009	013	And the Lord said unto me, thus, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiff-necked people:
005	DEU	009	014	Let me alone, and I will destroy them, and blot out their name from under the heavens; and I will make of thee a nation mightier and more numerous than they.
005	DEU	009	015	And I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount was burning with fire; and the two tables of the covenant were upon my two hands.
005	DEU	009	016	And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the Lord your God, ye had made yourselves a molten calf; ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the Lord had commanded you.
005	DEU	009	017	And I took hold of the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and I broke them before your eyes.
005	DEU	009	018	And I threw myself down before the Lord, as at the first, forty days and forty nights; bread did I not eat, and water did I not drink; on account of all your sins which ye had committed, in doing what is evil in the eyes of the Lord, to provoke him to anger.
005	DEU	009	019	For I was afraid of the anger and the indignation, wherewith the Lord was wroth against you to destroy you; but the Lord hearkened unto me also at that time.
005	DEU	009	020	And with Aaron was the Lord very angry to destroy him; and I prayed also for Aaron at the same time.
005	DEU	009	021	And your work of sin, which ye had made, the calf, I took and burnt it in fire, and stamped it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descendeth from the mount.
005	DEU	009	022	And at Taberah, and at Massah and at Kibroth-hattaavah, have ye been provoking the Lord to wrath.
005	DEU	009	023	And when the Lord sent you from Kadesh-barnea', saying, Go up and take possession of the land which I have given you: then rebelled ye against the order of the Lord your God, and ye believed not in him, and ye hearkened not to his voice.
005	DEU	009	024	Rebellious have ye been against the Lord, from the day that I have known you.
005	DEU	009	025	And I threw myself down before the Lord those forty days and forty nights, which I threw myself down; because the Lord had said that he would destroy you.
005	DEU	009	026	And I prayed unto the Lord, and said, O Lord Eternal, destroy not thy people and thy heritage, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
005	DEU	009	027	Think of thy servants, of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob; turn not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to its wickedness, nor to its sin:
005	DEU	009	028	Lest [the inhabitants of] the land whence thou hast brought us out say, Out of want of ability in the Lord to bring them into the land which he had promised them, and out of his hatred to them, hath he brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.
005	DEU	009	029	Whereas they are thy people and thy heritage, whom thou hast brought out by thy mighty power and by thy outstretched arm.
005	DEU	010	001	At that time the Lord said unto me, Hew for thyself two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount; and make thyself an ark of wood.
005	DEU	010	002	And I will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables which thou hast broken; and thou shalt put them in the ark.
005	DEU	010	003	And I made an ark of shittim-wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and I went up into the mount, with the two tables in my hand.
005	DEU	010	004	And he wrote on the tables, like the first writing, the ten commandments, which the Lord had spoken unto you on the mount out of the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly; and the Lord gave them unto me.
005	DEU	010	005	And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and I put the tables in the ark which I had made; and they have remained there, as the Lord hath commanded me.
005	DEU	010	006	And the children of Israel took their journey from the wells of the children of Ya'akan to Mosserah: there Aaron died, and he was buried there; and Elazar his son became priest in his stead.
005	DEU	010	007	From there they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Yotbatha, a land of brooks of waters.
005	DEU	010	008	At that time did the Lord separate the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord, to stand before the Lord to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.
005	DEU	010	009	Therefore was not assigned unto Levi any portion or inheritance with his brethren: the Lord is his inheritance, as the Lord thy God hath spoken to him.
005	DEU	010	010	And I stayed on the mount, like the first days, forty days and forty nights; and the Lord hearkened unto me also at that time, the Lord would not destroy thee.
005	DEU	010	011	And the Lord said unto me, Arise, go on the journey before the people, that they may go in and take possession of the land, which I have sworn unto their fathers to give unto them.
005	DEU	010	012	And now, Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,
005	DEU	010	013	To keep the commandments of the Lord, and his statutes, which I command thee this day, for thy own good?
005	DEU	010	014	Behold, to the Lord thy God belong the heavens and the heavens of heavens, and the earth with all that is thereon;
005	DEU	010	015	Yet only in thy fathers had the Lord delight, to love them; he chose, therefore, their seed after them, namely you, from all the nations, as it is this day.
005	DEU	010	016	Remove therefore the obduracy of your heart, and be no more stiff-necked.
005	DEU	010	017	For the Lord your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of lords, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who hath no regard to persons, and taketh no bribe;
005	DEU	010	018	Who executeth justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loveth the stranger, to give him food and raiment.
005	DEU	010	019	Love ye then the stranger; for you have been strangers in the land of Egypt.
005	DEU	010	020	The Lord thy God shalt thou fear: him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and by his name shalt thou swear.
005	DEU	010	021	He is thy praise, and he is thy God, who hath done for thee these great and fearful things, which thy own eyes have seen.
005	DEU	010	022	With seventy persons did thy fathers go down into Egypt; and now the Lord thy God hath made thee like the stars of heaven in multitude.
005	DEU	011	001	Thou shalt therefore love the Lord thy God, and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his ordinances, and his commandments, all the days.
005	DEU	011	002	And ye shall know this day, that [I speak] not with your children who have not known, and who have not seen the chastisement of the Lord your God, his greatness, his strong hand, and his outstretched arm;
005	DEU	011	003	And his signs, and his acts, which he displayed in the midst of Egypt, unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land;
005	DEU	011	004	And what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto its horses, and to its chariots; over whom he caused the water of the Red Sea to flow, as they pursued after you, and whom the Lord destroyed unto this day;
005	DEU	011	005	And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came unto this place;
005	DEU	011	006	And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben; how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the living substance that followed them, in the midst of all Israel;
005	DEU	011	007	But it is your own eyes which have seen all the great acts of the Lord which he hath done.
005	DEU	011	008	Ye shall therefore keep all the commandment which I command you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and take possession of the land, whither ye go over to possess it;
005	DEU	011	009	And in order that ye may live many days in the land, which the Lord hath sworn unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a land flowing with milk and honey.
005	DEU	011	010	For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not like the land of Egypt, from where ye came out, where thou sowest thy seed, and waterest it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs;
005	DEU	011	011	But the land, whither ye go over to possess it, is a land of mountains and valleys, from the rain of heaven doth it drink water.
005	DEU	011	012	A land which the Lord thy God careth for; always are the eyes of the Lord thy God upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.
005	DEU	011	013	And it shall come to pass, if ye will hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love the Lord your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,
005	DEU	011	014	That I will send rain for your land in its due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thy oil.
005	DEU	011	015	And I will give grass in thy field for thy cattle; and thou shalt eat and be satisfied,
005	DEU	011	016	Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;
005	DEU	011	017	[For] then the Lord's wrath will be kindled against you, and he will shut up the heavens that there be no rain, and the land will not yield her products; and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which the Lord giveth unto you.
005	DEU	011	018	Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul; and ye shall bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.
005	DEU	011	019	And ye shall teach them to your children, to speak of them when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.
005	DEU	011	020	And thou shalt write them upon the door-posts of thy house, and upon thy gates.
005	DEU	011	021	In order that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the Lord swore unto your fathers to give unto them, as the days of the heavens over the earth.
005	DEU	011	022	For if ye will diligently keep all this commandment which I command you, in order to do it, to love the Lord your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him:
005	DEU	011	023	Then will the Lord drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall supplant nations greater and mightier than yourselves.
005	DEU	011	024	Every place whereon the sole of your foot may tread shall be yours: from the wilderness and the Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the Western Sea shall be your boundary.
005	DEU	011	025	There shall no man be able to stand up before you; the dread of you and the fear of you will the Lord your God lay upon all the land which ye may tread upon, as he hath spoken unto you.
005	DEU	011	026	Behold, I lay before you this day a blessing and a curse:
005	DEU	011	027	The blessing, if ye will hearken unto the commandments of the Lord your God, which I command you this day;
005	DEU	011	028	And the curse, if ye will not hearken unto the commandments of the Lord your God, and ye turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye know not.
005	DEU	011	029	And it shall come to pass, when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizzim, and the curse upon mount 'Ebal.
005	DEU	011	030	Behold, they are on the other side of the Jordan, far away in the direction of the going down of the sun, in the land of the Canaanites, who dwell in the plain, opposite Gilgal, near the grove of Moreh.
005	DEU	011	031	For ye are about to pass over the Jordan to go in to take possession of the land which the Lord your God giveth you; and ye will possess it, and dwell therein.
005	DEU	011	032	And ye shall then observe to do all the statutes and ordinances which I set before you this day.
005	DEU	012	001	These are the statutes and ordinances, which ye shall observe to do, in the land which the Lord, the God of thy fathers, giveth unto thee to possess it, and all the days that ye live upon the earth.
005	DEU	012	002	Ye shall utterly destroy all the places whereon the nations which ye are about to drive out served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree;
005	DEU	012	003	And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their statues, and their groves shall ye burn with fire; and the graven images of their gods shall ye hew down; and ye shall destroy their name out of the same place.
005	DEU	012	004	Ye shall not do so unto the Lord your God;
005	DEU	012	005	But unto the place which the Lord your God may choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall ye repair, and thither shalt thou come;
005	DEU	012	006	And ye shall bring thither your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the heave-offering of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill-offerings, and the first-born of your herds and of your flocks;
005	DEU	012	007	And ye shall eat there before the Lord your God, and ye shall rejoice with all the acquisition of your hand, ye and your households, wherewith the Lord thy God may have blessed thee.
005	DEU	012	008	Ye shall not do after all the manner that we do here this day, every one whatsoever is right in his own eyes.
005	DEU	012	009	For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the Lord thy God giveth thee.
005	DEU	012	010	But ye will go over the Jordan, and dwell in the land which the Lord your God causeth you to inherit, and he will give you rest from all your enemies round about, so that ye may dwell in safety.
005	DEU	012	011	And then shall it be, that the place which the Lord your God will choose to cause his name to dwell there, —[even] thither shall ye bring all that I command you: your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave-offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye may vow unto the Lord;
005	DEU	012	012	And ye shall rejoice before the Lord your God, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and the Levite who is within your gates; because he hath not any portion nor inheritance with you.
005	DEU	012	013	Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt-offerings in every place which thou mayest see;
005	DEU	012	014	But in the place which the Lord will choose in one of thy tribes, there shalt thou offer thy burnt-offerings, and there shalt thou do all that I command thee.
005	DEU	012	015	Notwithstanding, according to all the longing of thy soul, mayest thou kill and eat flesh, according to the blessing of the Lord thy God which he hath given thee, in all thy gates: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the roebuck, and as of the hart.
005	DEU	012	016	Only the blood shall ye not eat: upon the earth shall ye pour it out as water.
005	DEU	012	017	Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of thy wine, or of thy oil, nor the first-born of thy herds or of thy flocks, nor any of thy vows which thou mayest vow, nor thy freewill-offerings, and the heave-offering of thy hand;
005	DEU	012	018	But before the Lord thy God must thou eat them in the place which the Lord thy God may choose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the Levite who is within thy gates; and thou shalt rejoice before the Lord thy God with all the acquisition of thy hand.
005	DEU	012	019	Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest upon thy land.
005	DEU	012	020	When the Lord thy God will enlarge thy border, as he hath spoken unto thee, and thou dost say, I wish to eat flesh, because thy soul longeth to eat flesh: then mayest thou, according to all the longing of thy soul, eat flesh.
005	DEU	012	021	If the place which the Lord thy God may choose to put his name there be too far for thee: then mayest thou kill of thy herds and of thy flocks, which the Lord hath given thee, as I have commanded thee; and thou shalt eat in thy gates according to all the longing of thy soul.
005	DEU	012	022	But as the roebuck and the hart are eaten, so shalt thou eat the same: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof together.
005	DEU	012	023	Only be firm so as not to eat the blood; for the blood is the life; and thou shalt not eat the life with the flesh.
005	DEU	012	024	Thou shalt not eat it: upon the earth shalt thou pour it out like water.
005	DEU	012	025	Thou shalt not eat it; in order that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, when thou wilt do what is right in the eyes of the Lord.
005	DEU	012	026	Nevertheless thy holy things which thou mayest have, and thy vows, shalt thou take, and go unto the place which the Lord may choose:
005	DEU	012	027	And thou shalt offer thy burnt-offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of the Lord thy God; and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the Lord thy God, and the flesh shalt thou eat.
005	DEU	012	028	Observe and hear all these words which I command thee; in order that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when thou wilt do what is good and right in the eyes of the Lord thy God.
005	DEU	012	029	When the Lord thy God will cut off the nations, whither thou goest to drive them out from before thee, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their land:
005	DEU	012	030	Then take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them, after they have been destroyed from before thee; and that thou inquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.
005	DEU	012	031	Thou shalt not do so unto the Lord thy God; for every abomination to the Lord, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters have they burnt in the fire to their gods.
005	DEU	012	032	What thing soever I command you, even that shall ye observe to do: thou shalt not add thereto, and thou shalt not diminish therefrom.
005	DEU	013	001	If there arise in the midst of thee a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and he giveth thee a sign or a token,
005	DEU	013	002	And the sign or the token come to pass, whereof he spoke unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou dost not know, and let us serve them:
005	DEU	013	003	Then shalt thou not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or unto that dreamer of dreams; for the Lord your God proveth you, to know whether ye indeed love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul.
005	DEU	013	004	After the Lord your God shall ye walk, and him shall ye fear, and his commandments shall ye keep, and his voice shall ye obey, and him shall ye serve, and unto him shall ye cleave.
005	DEU	013	005	And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death; because he hath spoken revolt against the Lord your God, who hath brought you out of the land of Egypt, and who hath redeemed you out of the house of bond-men, to mislead thee front the way which the Lord thy God commanded thee to walk therein; and thou shalt put the evil away from the midst of thee.
005	DEU	013	006	If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, who is [dear to thee] as thy own soul, should entice thee, in secret, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou dost not know, either thou, or thy fathers;
005	DEU	013	007	Some of the gods of the nations which are round about you, that are nigh unto thee, or that are far off from thee, from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth:
005	DEU	013	008	Then shalt thou not consent unto him, nor shalt thou hearken unto him; nor shall thy eye look with pity on him, nor shalt thou spare, nor shalt thou conceal it for him;
005	DEU	013	009	But thou shalt surely kill him; thy hand shall be the first upon him to put him to death, and the hand of all the people afterward.
005	DEU	013	010	And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he sought to mislead thee from the Lord thy God, who hath brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bond-men.
005	DEU	013	011	And all Israel shall hear it, and they shall be afraid, and they shall not do any more such a wicked deed as this is in the midst of thee.
005	DEU	013	012	If thou shouldst hear concerning one of thy cities, which the Lord thy God hath given thee to dwell there, saying,
005	DEU	013	013	There have gone forth men, children of worthlessness, from the midst of thee, and have misled the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known:
005	DEU	013	014	Then shalt thou inquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be true, the thing is certain, such abomination hath been wrought in the midst of thee:
005	DEU	013	015	Then shalt thou smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, devoting it utterly, and all that is therein, and the cattle thereof, to the edge of the sword.
005	DEU	013	016	And all its spoil shalt thou gather into the midst of the market-place thereof, and thou shalt burn with fire the city, and all its spoil entirely, unto the Lord thy God; and it shall be a ruinous heap for ever: it shall not be built again.
005	DEU	013	017	And there shall not cleave to thy hand aught of the devoted things; in order that the Lord may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and grant thee mercy, and have mercy upon thee, and multiply thee, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers;
005	DEU	013	018	When thou wilt hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, to keep all his commandments which I command thee this day, to do what is right in the eyes of the Lord thy God.
005	DEU	014	001	Ye are the children of the Lord your God: ye shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.
005	DEU	014	002	For a holy people art thou unto the Lord thy God, and the Lord hath made choice of thee to be unto himself a peculiar nation above all the nations that are upon the face of the earth.
005	DEU	014	003	Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing.
005	DEU	014	004	These are the beasts which ye may eat: The ox, the sheep, and the goat,
005	DEU	014	005	The hart, and the roebuck, and the fallow-deer, and the chamois, and the gazelle, and the wild ox, and the antelope.
005	DEU	014	006	And every beast that hath parted hoofs, and whose feet are cleft into two claws, and cheweth the cud among the beasts—that alone may ye eat.
005	DEU	014	007	Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of those that chew the cud, and of those that possess the divided cloven hoof: The camel, and the hare, and the coney: for they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof; unclean are they unto you;
005	DEU	014	008	And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it is unclean unto you; of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their dead carcass shall ye not touch.
005	DEU	014	009	This may ye eat of all that is in the waters: all that hath fins and scales may ye eat;
005	DEU	014	010	And whatsoever hath not fins and scales shall ye not eat; it is unclean unto you.
005	DEU	014	011	Every clean bird may ye eat.
005	DEU	014	012	But these are they which ye shall not eat of them: The eagle, and the ossifrage, and the osprey,
005	DEU	014	013	And the glede, and the kite, and the vulture after his kind,
005	DEU	014	014	And every raven after his kind,
005	DEU	014	015	And the ostrich, and the night-hawk, and the cuckoo, and the hawk after his kind,
005	DEU	014	016	The little owl, and the great owl and the swan,
005	DEU	014	017	And the pelican, and the gier-eagle, and the cormorant,
005	DEU	014	018	And the stork, and the heron after his kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.
005	DEU	014	019	And every winged insect is unclean unto you: it shall not be eaten.
005	DEU	014	020	All clean fowls may ye eat.
005	DEU	014	021	Ye shall not eat any thing that dieth of itself: unto the stranger that is in thy gates canst thou give it, that he may eat it; or thou mayest sell it unto an alien; for thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God; thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother's milk.
005	DEU	014	022	Thou shalt truly tithe all the produce of thy seed, which the field bringeth forth year by year.
005	DEU	014	023	And thou shalt eat before the Lord thy God, in the place which he will choose to cause his name to dwell there, the tithe of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thy oil, and the first-born of thy herds and of thy flocks; in order that thou may learn to fear the Lord thy God all the days.
005	DEU	014	024	And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able to carry it; because the place is too far from thee, which the Lord thy God will choose to set his name there, because the Lord thy God will bless thee:
005	DEU	014	025	Then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up the money in thy hand, and thou shalt go unto the place which the Lord thy God will choose;
005	DEU	014	026	And thou shalt lay out that money for whatsoever thy soul longeth after, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul asketh of thee; and thou shalt eat it there before the Lord thy God, and thou shalt rejoice, thou, and thy household.
005	DEU	014	027	And the Levite, who is within thy gates, him shalt thou not forsake; for he hath no portion nor inheritance with thee.
005	DEU	014	028	At the end of three years shalt thou bring forth all the tithe of thy produce in the same year, and thou shalt lay it down within thy gates:
005	DEU	014	029	And then shall come the Levite, because he hath no portion nor inheritance with thee, with the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within thy gates, and they shall eat and be satisfied; in order that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all the work of thy hand which thou doest.
005	DEU	015	001	At the end of [every] seven years shalt thou make a release.
005	DEU	015	002	And this is the manner of the release: Every creditor shall release the loan which he hath lent to his neighbor; he shall not exact it of his neighbor, or of his brother; because the release year in honor of the Lord hath been proclaimed.
005	DEU	015	003	Of a foreigner thou mayest exact [payment]; but that which is thine with thy brother shall thy hand release.
005	DEU	015	004	Although indeed there should be no needy man among thee; for the Lord will greatly bless thee in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it:
005	DEU	015	005	Yet only if thou wilt carefully hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to observe to do all this commandment which I command thee this day.
005	DEU	015	006	For the Lord thy God blesseth thee, as he hath spoken unto thee; and thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt rule over many nations, but over thee shall they not rule.
005	DEU	015	007	If there be among thee a needy man, any one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land which the Lord thy God giveth thee: thou shalt not harden thy heart, nor shut thy hand from thy needy brother.
005	DEU	015	008	But thou shalt open wide thy hand unto him, and thou shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need, which his want requireth.
005	DEU	015	009	Beware that there be not a wicked thought in thy heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thy eye be thus evil against thy needy brother, so that thou wouldst give him nought; and if he cry concerning thee unto the Lord, it will be sin in thee:
005	DEU	015	010	Thou shalt surely give him, and thy heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him; for because of this thing the Lord thy God will bless thee in all thy work, and in all the acquisition of thy hand.
005	DEU	015	011	For the needy will not cease out of the land; therefore do I command thee, saying, Thou shalt open wide thy hand unto thy brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.
005	DEU	015	012	If thy brother, the Hebrew, or a Hebrew woman, be sold unto thee, he shall serve thee six years; and in the seventh year shalt thou let him go free from thee.
005	DEU	015	013	And when thou lettest him go out free from thee, thou shalt not let him go away empty:
005	DEU	015	014	Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flocks, and out of thy threshing-floor, and out of thy wine-press; wherewith the Lord thy God hath blessed thee, that shalt thou give unto him.
005	DEU	015	015	And thou shalt remember that thou hast been a bond-man in the land of Egypt, and that the Lord thy God hath redeemed thee; therefore do I command thee this thing today.
005	DEU	015	016	And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from thee; because he loveth thee and thy house, because he is well with thee:
005	DEU	015	017	Then shalt thou take an awl, and thrust it through his ear unto the door, and he shall be unto thee a servant for ever; and also unto thy maid-servant shalt thou do likewise.
005	DEU	015	018	It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou sendest him away free from thee, that for double the wages of a hired laborer hath he served thee six years; and the Lord thy God will bless thee in all that thou doest.
005	DEU	015	019	All the first-born males that come of thy herds and of thy flocks shalt thou sanctify unto the Lord thy God: thou shalt do no work with the first-born of thy bullock, and not shear the first-born of thy sheep.
005	DEU	015	020	Before the Lord thy God shalt thou eat it year by year, in the place which the Lord will choose, thou with thy household.
005	DEU	015	021	And if there be any blemish thereon, if it be lame, or blind, or have any [other] ill blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the Lord thy God.
005	DEU	015	022	Within thy gates shalt thou eat it, the unclean and the clean together, as the roebuck, and as the hart.
005	DEU	015	023	Only the blood thereof shalt thou not eat: upon the ground shalt thou pour it out as water.
005	DEU	016	001	Observe the month of Abib, and prepare the passover-sacrifice unto the Lord thy God; for in the month of Abib did the Lord thy God bring thee forth out of Egypt by night.
005	DEU	016	002	And thou shalt sacrifice the passover-offering unto the Lord thy God of sheep and oxen, in the place which the Lord will choose to let his name dwell there.
005	DEU	016	003	Thou shalt not eat therewith any leavened bread: seven days shalt thou eat therewith unleavened bread, the bread of affliction; for in haste didst thou go forth out of the land of Egypt; in order that thou mayest remember the day of thy going forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life.
005	DEU	016	004	And there shall not be seen with thee any leaven in all thy borders seven days: neither shall there any of the flesh, which thou sacrificedst in the evening, on the first day, remain all night until the morning.
005	DEU	016	005	Thou mayest not slay the passover within any of thy gates, which the Lord thy God giveth thee;
005	DEU	016	006	But at the place which the Lord thy God will choose to let his name dwell in, there shalt thou slay the passover at evening, at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt.
005	DEU	016	007	And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the Lord thy God will choose; and thou shalt turn in the morning, and go unto thy tents.
005	DEU	016	008	Six days shalt thou eat unleavened bread; and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the Lord thy God: thou shalt do no work.
005	DEU	016	009	Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thyself: from the time thou beginnest to put the sickle to the corn, shalt thou begin to number seven weeks.
005	DEU	016	010	And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the Lord thy God with a tribute of a freewill-offering of thy hand, which thou shalt give: according as the Lord thy God shall have blessed thee.
005	DEU	016	011	And thou shalt rejoice before the Lord thy God, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the Levite that is within thy gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are in the midst of thee, in the place which the Lord thy God will choose to let his name dwell there.
005	DEU	016	012	And thou shalt remember that thou hast been a bond-man in Egypt; and thou shalt observe and do these statutes.
005	DEU	016	013	The feast of tabernacles shalt thou hold for thyself seven days, when thou hast gathered in the produce of thy threshing-floor and of thy wine-press:
005	DEU	016	014	And thou shalt rejoice on thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the Levite, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within thy gates.
005	DEU	016	015	Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the Lord thy God in the place which the Lord will choose; because the Lord thy God will bless thee in all thy product, and in all the work of thy hands, and thou shalt only rejoice.
005	DEU	016	016	Three times in the year shall every one of thy males appear before the Lord thy God in the place which he will choose: on the feast of unleavened bread, and on the feast of weeks, and on the feast of tabernacles; and no one shall appear before the Lord empty;
005	DEU	016	017	Every man according to what his hand can give, according to the blessing of the Lord thy God which he hath given thee.
005	DEU	016	018	Judges and officers shalt thou appoint unto thyself in all thy gates, which the Lord thy God giveth thee, throughout thy tribes: and they shall judge the people with a just judgment.
005	DEU	016	019	Thou shalt not wrest judgment; thou shalt not respect persons, and thou shalt not take a bribe; for the bribe blindeth the eyes of the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous.
005	DEU	016	020	Justice, only justice shalt thou pursue; in order that thou mayest live, and retain possession of the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.
005	DEU	016	021	Thou shalt not plant unto thyself a grove, any tree, near the altar of the Lord thy God, which thou shalt make unto thyself.
005	DEU	016	022	Neither shalt thou set thee up any statue, which the Lord thy God hateth.
005	DEU	017	001	Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the Lord thy God any bullock, or lamb, whereon there is a blemish, any thing evil; for it is an abomination unto the Lord thy God.
005	DEU	017	002	If there be found in the midst of thee, within any one of thy gates, which the Lord thy God giveth thee. a man or a woman, that doth the wickedness in the eyes of the Lord thy God, to transgress his covenant,
005	DEU	017	003	And he hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either the sun, or the moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have prohibited;
005	DEU	017	004	And it be told thee, and thou hearest of it: then shalt thou inquire diligently; and, behold, if it be true, the thing is certain, such abomination hath been wrought in Israel:
005	DEU	017	005	Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, who have committed this wicked thing, unto thy gates, the man or the woman, and thou shalt stone them with stones till they die.
005	DEU	017	006	Upon the evidence of two witnesses, or of three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death be put to death; he shall not be put to death upon the evidence of one witness.
005	DEU	017	007	The hand of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death, and the hand of all the people at the last; and thou shalt put the evil away from the midst of thee.
005	DEU	017	008	If a matter be unknown to thee for decision, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between bodily injury and injury, [or] matters of controversy within thy gates: then shalt thou arise, and get thee up unto the place which the Lord thy God will choose;
005	DEU	017	009	And thou shalt come unto the priests, the Levites, and unto the judge that may be in those days, and thou shalt inquire, and they shall inform thee of the sentence of the case;
005	DEU	017	010	And thou shalt do according to the sentence, which they may tell thee from that place which the Lord will choose, and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they may instruct thee;
005	DEU	017	011	In accordance with the instruction which they may instruct thee, and according to the decision which they may say unto thee, shalt thou do: thou shalt not depart from the sentence which they may tell thee, to the right, or to the left.
005	DEU	017	012	And the man that will act presumptuously, so as not to hearken unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the Lord thy God, or unto the judge, even that man shall die; and thou shalt put away the evil from Israel.
005	DEU	017	013	And all the people shall hear, and be afraid, and not act presumptuously any more.
005	DEU	017	014	When thou art come unto the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, and thou hast taken possession of it, and dwellest therein, and thou sayest, I wish to set a king over me, like all the nations that are round about me:
005	DEU	017	015	Then mayest thou indeed set a king over thee, the one whom the Lord thy God will choose; [but] from the midst of thy brethren shalt thou set a king over thee; thou mayest not set over thee a stranger, who is not thy brother.
005	DEU	017	016	Only he shall not acquire for himself many horses; so that he may not cause the people to return to Egypt, in order to acquire many horses; whereas the Lord hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth not return on that way any more.
005	DEU	017	017	Neither shall he take to himself many wives, that his heart may not turn away; nor shall he acquire for himself too much silver and gold.
005	DEU	017	018	And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write for himself a copy of this law in a book out of [that which is] before the priests, the Levites;
005	DEU	017	019	And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life: in order that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them.
005	DEU	017	020	So that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and so that he turn not aside from the commandment, to the right, or to the left: in order that he may live many days in his kingdom, he, and his children, in the midst of Israel.
005	DEU	018	001	The priests, the Levites, and all the tribe of Levi, shall have no portion nor inheritance with Israel: the fire-offerings of the Lord, and his inheritance shall they consume.
005	DEU	018	002	But any inheritance shall he not have among his brethren: the Lord is his inheritance, as he hath spoken unto him.
005	DEU	018	003	And this shall be the priests' due from the people, from them that slay an animal, whether it be ox or lamb: then shall each one give unto the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw.
005	DEU	018	004	The first-fruit of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thy oil, and the first shearing of thy sheep, shalt thou give him.
005	DEU	018	005	For him the Lord thy God hath chosen out of all thy tribes, to stand to minister in the name of the Lord, he and his sons all the days.
005	DEU	018	006	And if the Levite come from any one of thy gates out of all Israel, where he sojourneth, and come with all the longing of his soul unto the place which the Lord will choose:
005	DEU	018	007	Then can he minister in the name of the Lord his God, like all his brethren the Levites, who stand there before the Lord.
005	DEU	018	008	They shall have like portions to eat, besides that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony.
005	DEU	018	009	When thou comest into the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations.
005	DEU	018	010	There shall not be found among thee any one who causeth his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, one who useth divination, one who is an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a conjurer.
005	DEU	018	011	Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or who inquireth of the dead.
005	DEU	018	012	For an abomination unto the Lord are all that do these things; and on account of these abominations the Lord thy God doth drive them out from before thee.
005	DEU	018	013	Perfect shalt thou be with the Lord thy God.
005	DEU	018	014	For these nations, which thou art about to dispossess, hearken unto observers of times, and unto diviners; but as for thee, the Lord thy God hath not assigned the like unto thee.
005	DEU	018	015	A prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me, will the Lord thy God raise up unto thee; unto him shall ye hearken:
005	DEU	018	016	According to all that thou didst desire of the Lord thy God at Horeb on the day of the assembly, saying, I wish no more to hear the voice of the Lord my God, and this great fire I wish not to see again, that I die not.
005	DEU	018	017	And the Lord said unto me, They have done well in what they have spoken.
005	DEU	018	018	A prophet will I raise up unto them from among their brethren, like unto thee; and I will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I may command him.
005	DEU	018	019	And it shall come to pass, that if there be a man who will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I myself will require it of him.
005	DEU	018	020	But the prophet, who may presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or who may speak in the name of other Gods even that prophet shall die.
005	DEU	018	021	And if thou shouldst say in thy heart, How shall we know the word which the Lord hath not spoken?
005	DEU	018	022	That which the prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord, and the thing do not happen and come not to pass— this is the word which the Lord hath not spoken; in presumption hath the prophet spoken it; thou shalt not be afraid of him.
005	DEU	019	001	When the Lord thy God shall have cut off the nations, whose land the Lord thy God giveth thee, and thou hast driven them out, and dwellest in their cities, and in their houses:
005	DEU	019	002	Then shalt thou set apart three cities for thyself, in the midst of thy land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee to possess it.
005	DEU	019	003	Thou shalt put in order for thyself the [way to them], and divide into three parts the territory of thy land, which the Lord thy God will give thee to inherit, and it shall serve, that every man-slayer may flee thither.
005	DEU	019	004	And this is the case of the man-slayer, who shall flee thither, that he may live: Whoso smiteth his neighbor without knowledge, when he hath not been an enemy to him in time past;
005	DEU	019	005	And he that goeth into the forest with his neighbor to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the iron slippeth from the helve, and striketh his neighbor, that he die: this one shall flee unto one of these cities, and live;
005	DEU	019	006	That the avenger of the blood pursue not the manslayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and smite him dead; whereas he deserveth not a judgment of death, inasmuch as he was not an enemy to him in time past.
005	DEU	019	007	Therefore do I command thee, saying, Three cities shalt thou set apart for thyself.
005	DEU	019	008	And if the Lord thy God enlarge thy boundary, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, and give thee all the land which he hath spoken to give unto thy fathers;
005	DEU	019	009	Because thou dost keep all this commandment to do it, which I command thee this day, to love the Lord thy God, and to walk in his ways all the days: then shalt thou add for thyself three cities more, unto these three;
005	DEU	019	010	That innocent blood be not shed in the midst of thy land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and blood-guiltiness be brought upon thee.
005	DEU	019	011	But if any man be an enemy to his neighbor, and he lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally so that he die, and he flee unto one of these cities:
005	DEU	019	012	Then shall the elders of his city send and fetch him thence, and they shall deliver him into the hand of the avenger of the blood, that he may die.
005	DEU	019	013	Thy eye shall not look with pity on him; but thou shalt put away the [shedding of] innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with thee.
005	DEU	019	014	Thou shalt not remove the landmark of thy neighbor, which they of old time have set, in thy inheritance which thou shalt inherit, in the land that the Lord thy God giveth thee to possess it.
005	DEU	019	015	There shall not rise up one single witness against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: upon the evidence of two witnesses, or upon the evidence of three witnesses, must a case be established.
005	DEU	019	016	If a witness of violence rise up against any man to testify against him for any wrong:
005	DEU	019	017	Then shall both the men, who have the controversy, stand before the Lord, before the priests and the judges, who shall be in those days;
005	DEU	019	018	And the judges shall inquire diligently; and, behold, if the witness be a false witness, he hath testified a falsehood against his brother:
005	DEU	019	019	Then shall ye do unto him, as he had purposed to do unto his brother; and thou shalt put away the evil from the midst of thee.
005	DEU	019	020	And those who remain shall hear, and be afraid, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil thing in the midst of thee.
005	DEU	019	021	And thy eye shall have no pity; but life [shall go] for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
005	DEU	020	001	When thou goest out to battle against thy enemies, and thou seest horse, and chariot, people more in number than thou: be not afraid of them; for the Lord thy God is with thee, who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
005	DEU	020	002	And it shall be, when ye come nigh unto the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people;
005	DEU	020	003	And he shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye come nigh this day unto the battle against your enemies: let not your hearts faint, fear not, and be not downcast, and do not tremble because of them:
005	DEU	020	004	For the Lord your God it is who goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to help you.
005	DEU	020	005	And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man is there who hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it.
005	DEU	020	006	And what man is there who hath planted a vineyard, and hath not redeemed it? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man redeem it.
005	DEU	020	007	And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.
005	DEU	020	008	And the officers shall speak yet farther unto the people, and they shall say, What man is there that is fearful and faint-hearted? let him go and return unto his house, that the heart of his brethren become not as faint as his heart.
005	DEU	020	009	And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people, that they shall appoint captains of the armies at the head of the people.
005	DEU	020	010	When thou comest nigh unto a city to make war against it, then summon it with words of peace.
005	DEU	020	011	And it shall be, if it make thee an answer of peace, and open [its gates] unto thee: then shall it be, that all the people that are found therein shall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve thee.
005	DEU	020	012	But if it will not make peace with thee, and wageth war against thee; then shalt thou besiege it;
005	DEU	020	013	And when the Lord thy God hath delivered it into thy hands, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword;
005	DEU	020	014	But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that may be in the city, all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take as booty unto thyself; and thou shalt enjoy the spoil of thy enemies, which the Lord thy God hath given thee.
005	DEU	020	015	Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee, which are not of the cities of these nations.
005	DEU	020	016	But of the cities of these people, which the Lord thy God doth give thee for an inheritance, shalt thou not let live a single soul.
005	DEU	020	017	But thou shalt utterly devote them; namely, the Hittites, and the Emorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites; as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee;
005	DEU	020	018	In order that they may not teach you to do in accordance with all their abominations, which they have done unto their gods; and ye would thus sin against the Lord your God.
005	DEU	020	019	When thou besiegest a city a long time, to make war against it to capture it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them; for of them thou mayest eat, and thou shalt not cut them down, [for man liveth of the trees of the field,] to employ them in thy siege;
005	DEU	020	020	Only those trees of which thou knowest that they are not fruit-trees, thou mayest destroy and cut down; and [thus] thou canst build bulwarks against the city that wageth war with thee, until it be subdued.
005	DEU	021	001	If there be found a slain person in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, [and] it be not known who hath slain him:
005	DEU	021	002	Then shall thy elders and thy judges go forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about the one that is slain.
005	DEU	021	003	And it shall be, that the city which is the nearest unto the slain person, even the elders of that city shall take a heifer, which hath not been wrought with, which hath not drawn in a yoke;
005	DEU	021	004	And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley, which is neither tilled nor sown, and they shall break there the neck of the heifer in the valley;
005	DEU	021	005	And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the Lord thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the name of the Lord; and after their decision shall be done [at] every controversy and every injury;
005	DEU	021	006	And all the elders of that city who are nearest unto the slain person shall wash their hands over the heifer, the neck of which is broken in the valley.
005	DEU	021	007	And they shall commence and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, and our eyes have not seen it.
005	DEU	021	008	Grant pardon unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, O Lord, and lay not innocent blood in the midst of thy people Israel: and the blood shall be forgiven unto them.
005	DEU	021	009	And thou shalt put away the [guilt of] the innocent blood from the midst of thee, when thou wilt do what is right in the eyes of the Lord.
005	DEU	021	010	When thou goest forth to war against thy enemies, and the Lord thy God delivereth them into thy hands, and thou takest captives of them;
005	DEU	021	011	And thou seest among the captives a woman of handsome form, and hast a desire unto her, that thou wouldst take her to thee for wife:
005	DEU	021	012	Then shalt thou bring her home to thy house; and she shall shave her head, and let grow her nails;
005	DEU	021	013	And she shall put off the raiment of her captivity from her, and she shall remain in thy house, and weep for her father and her mother a full month; and after that thou mayest go in unto her, and be her husband, that she may become thy wife.
005	DEU	021	014	And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then shalt thou let her go whither she will; but thou shalt nowise sell her for money; thou shalt not make a servant of her, because thou hast humbled her.
005	DEU	021	015	If a man have two wives, one beloved, and the other hated, and they bear him children, both the beloved and the hated; so that the first-born son be hers that is hated:
005	DEU	021	016	Then shall it be, when he divideth as inheritance among his sons what he hath, that he shall not institute the son of the beloved as the first-born before the son of the hated, the firstborn;
005	DEU	021	017	But the first-born, the son of the hated woman, shall he acknowledge, to give him a double portion of all that is found in his possession; for he is the beginning of his strength; to him belongeth the right of the first birth.
005	DEU	021	018	If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, who hearkeneth not to the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and they chastise him, and he will not hearken unto them:
005	DEU	021	019	Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place;
005	DEU	021	020	And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not hearken to our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.
005	DEU	021	021	And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die; and thou shalt put away the evil from the midst of thee; and all Israel shall hear, and be afraid.
005	DEU	021	022	And if a man have committed a sin for which there is a punishment of death, and he be to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree:
005	DEU	021	023	Then shall his body not remain all night on the tree, but thou shalt surely bury him on that day; [for he that is hanged is a dishonor of God;] and thou shalt not defile thy land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.
005	DEU	022	001	Thou shalt not see thy brother's ox or his lamb go astray, and withdraw thyself from them: thou shalt surely bring them back again unto thy brother.
005	DEU	022	002	But if thy brother be not nigh unto thee, or thou know him not: then shalt thou take it unto thy own house, and it shall remain with thee until thy brother inquire after it, and then shalt thou restore it to him.
005	DEU	022	003	In like manner shalt thou do with his ass; and in like manner shalt thou do with his raiment; and in like manner shalt thou do with every lost thing of thy brother's, which may have been lost to him, and which thou hast found; thou art not at liberty to withdraw thyself.
005	DEU	022	004	Thou shalt not see thy brother's ass or his ox fallen down by the way, and withdraw thyself from them: thou shalt surely help him to lift them up again.
005	DEU	022	005	A woman shall not have upon her the apparel of a man, and a man shall not put on a woman's garment; for an abomination unto the Lord thy God are all who do this.
005	DEU	022	006	If a bird's nest chance to be before thee in the way, on any tree, or on the ground, with young ones, or with eggs, and the mother be sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs: thou shalt not take the mother with the young;
005	DEU	022	007	But thou shalt surely let the mother go, and the young thou mayest take to thyself; in order that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest live many days.
005	DEU	022	008	When thou buildest a new house, thou shalt make a battlement for thy roof; that thou bring not blood upon thy house, if any one were to fall from there.
005	DEU	022	009	Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds; that the ripe fruit of thy seed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of the vineyard, be not defiled.
005	DEU	022	010	Thou shalt not plough with an ox and an ass together.
005	DEU	022	011	Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts, of woolen and linen together.
005	DEU	022	012	Thou shalt make thyself fringes upon the four corners of thy vesture, wherewith thou coverest thyself.
005	DEU	022	013	If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her,
005	DEU	022	014	And he lay an accusation against her, and spread abroad an evil name upon her, and say, This woman I took [for wife], and when I came near to her, I found no tokens of virginity in her:
005	DEU	022	015	Then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel's virginity unto the elders of the city, to the gate.
005	DEU	022	016	And the father of the damsel shall say unto the elders, My daughter I gave unto this man for wife; but he hath conceived hatred toward her;
005	DEU	022	017	And, lo, he hath laid an accusation [against her], saying, I have found no tokens of virginity in thy daughter; and yet these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity; and they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city.
005	DEU	022	018	And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him;
005	DEU	022	019	And they shall amerce him in a hundred shekels of silver, and give them unto the father of the damsel; because he hath spread abroad an evil name upon a virgin of Israel; and she shall remain his wife; he shall not be at liberty to put her away all his days.
005	DEU	022	020	But if this thing was true, there have not been found tokens of virginity in the damsel:
005	DEU	022	021	Then shall they lead out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die; because she hath wrought a disgraceful deed in Israel, to commit incest in her father's house; and thou shalt put away the evil from the midst of thee.
005	DEU	022	022	If a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband: then shall both of them die, the man that lieth with the woman, and the woman; and thou shalt put away the evil from Israel.
005	DEU	022	023	If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto a man, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her:
005	DEU	022	024	Then shall ye lead them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not [for aid] in the city; and the man, because he hath done violence to his neighbor's wife; and thou shalt put away the evil from the midst of thee.
005	DEU	022	025	But if in the field the man should find the betrothed damsel, and the man take hold of her by force, and lie with her: then shall the man that lay with her die alone;
005	DEU	022	026	But unto the damsel shalt thou not do any thing; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death; for as when a man riseth against his neighbor, and striketh him dead. even so is this matter;
005	DEU	022	027	For in the field did he find her; had the betrothed damsel even cried, there would have been none to aid her.
005	DEU	022	028	If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, who is not betrothed, and lay fast hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found:
005	DEU	022	029	Then shall the man who lieth with her give unto the father of the damsel fifty shekels of silver; and she shall become his wife, because he hath done violence to her, he shall not be at liberty to put her away all his days.
005	DEU	022	030	A man shall not take his lather's wife, and he shall not uncover his father's skirt.
005	DEU	023	001	He that is wounded in the testicles, or hath his privy member cut, shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord.
005	DEU	023	002	One born from prohibited connections shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord; even the tenth generation of him shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord.
005	DEU	023	003	An 'Ammonite and a Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord; even the tenth generation of him shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord, for ever;
005	DEU	023	004	For the reason, that they met you not with bread and with water on the way, when ye came forth out of Egypt; and because he hired against thee Bil'am the son of Beor of Pethor in Mesopotamia, to curse thee;
005	DEU	023	005	But the Lord thy God would not hearken unto Bil'am; and the Lord thy God changed unto thee the curse into a blessing, because the Lord thy God loved thee.
005	DEU	023	006	Thou shalt not seek their peace and their welfare all thy days, for ever.
005	DEU	023	007	Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite; for he is thy brother; thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian; because thou wast a stranger in his land.
005	DEU	023	008	The children that are born unto them in the third generation, may enter of them into the congregation of the Lord.
005	DEU	023	009	When thou goest forth into camp against thy enemies, then keep thyself from every evil thing.
005	DEU	023	010	If there be among thee any man, that is not clean by reason of an occurrence by night; then shall he go abroad to without the camp, he shall not come within the camp;
005	DEU	023	011	But it shall be, that toward evening he shall bathe himself in water; and when the sun goeth down, he may come into the midst of the camp.
005	DEU	023	012	And a place shalt thou have without the camp, whither thou shalt go forth abroad:
005	DEU	023	013	And a spade shalt thou have with thy weapons: and it shall be, when thou sittest abroad, that thou shalt dig therewith, and shalt afterward cover that which cometh from thee;
005	DEU	023	014	For the Lord thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver thee and to give up thy enemies before thee; therefore shall thy camp be holy; that he see no unseemly thing in thee, and turn away from thee.
005	DEU	023	015	Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant who may escape unto thee from his master;
005	DEU	023	016	With thee shall he dwell, in the midst of thee, in the place which he may choose in any one of thy gates, where it seemeth best to him: thou shalt not oppress him.
005	DEU	023	017	There shall not be a prostitute of the daughters of Israel, and there shall not be a sodomite of the sons of Israel.
005	DEU	023	018	Thou shalt not bring the hire of a harlot, or the price of a dog, into the house of the Lord thy God for any vow; for both of these are equally an abomination unto the Lord thy God.
005	DEU	023	019	Thou shalt not take interest from thy brother, interest of money, interest of victuals, interest of any thing that is lent upon interest:
005	DEU	023	020	From an alien thou mayest take interest; but from thy brother thou shalt not take interest; in order that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all the acquisition of thy hand, in the land whither thou goest to possess it.
005	DEU	023	021	When thou makest a vow unto the Lord thy God, thou shalt not delay to pay it; for the Lord thy God will surely require it of thee; and it would be sin in thee.
005	DEU	023	022	But if thou forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee.
005	DEU	023	023	What is gone out of thy lips shalt thou keep and perform, as thou hast vowed unto the Lord thy God voluntarily, as thou hast spoken with thy mouth.
005	DEU	023	024	When thou comest into thy neighbor's vineyard, thou mayest eat grapes at thy own pleasure, till thou have enough; but into thy vessel shalt thou not put any.
005	DEU	023	025	When thou comest into the standing corn of thy neighbor, thou mayest pluck ears with thy hand; but a sickle shall thou not move over thy neighbor's standing corn.
005	DEU	024	001	When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass, that if she find no favor in his eyes, because he hath found some scandalous thing in her, he may write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her away out of his house;
005	DEU	024	002	And she shall depart out of his house; and if she go and become another man's wife;
005	DEU	024	003	And the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her away out of his house; or if the latter husband, who took her as his wife, should die:
005	DEU	024	004	Then shall her former husband, who had sent her away, not be at liberty to take her again to be his wife, after she hath been defiled; for it is abomination before the Lord; and thou shalt not bring sin upon the land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.
005	DEU	024	005	When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, neither shall he be charged with any public business: he shall be free for his house one year, and shall cheer up his wife whom he hath taken.
005	DEU	024	006	No man shall take to pledge the nether or the upper millstone; for he taketh a man's life to pledge.
005	DEU	024	007	If a man be found stealing any one of his brethren of the children of Israel, and he treateth him as a slave, and selleth him: then shall that thief die; and thou shalt put the evil away from the midst of thee.
005	DEU	024	008	Take heed of the plague of leprosy, to observe diligently, and to do according to all that the priests, the Levites, may instruct you; as I have commanded them, so shall ye observe to do.
005	DEU	024	009	Remember what the Lord thy God did unto Miriam on the journey, at your coming forth out of Egypt.
005	DEU	024	010	When thou dost lend thy brother any thing as a loan, thou shalt not go into his house to take his pledge.
005	DEU	024	011	In the street shalt thou stand, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring out unto thee the pledge into the street.
005	DEU	024	012	And if he be a poor man, thou shalt not lie down with his pledge:
005	DEU	024	013	Thou shalt punctually deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth down, that he may lie under his own cover, and bless thee; and unto thee shall it be as righteousness before the Lord thy God.
005	DEU	024	014	Thou shalt not withhold the wages of a hired man, of the poor and needy, [whether he be] of thy brethren, or of the strangers that are in thy land within thy gates.
005	DEU	024	015	On the same day shalt thou give him his wages, that the sun may not go down upon it; for he is poor, and his soul longeth for it; so that he may not cry against thee unto the Lord, and it be sin in thee.
005	DEU	024	016	Fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall children be put to death for the fathers: for his own sin shall every man be put to death.
005	DEU	024	017	Thou shalt not pervert the cause of the stranger, or of the fatherless; and thou shalt not take in pledge the raiment of a widow;
005	DEU	024	018	But thou shalt remember that thou waste a bond-man in Egypt, and that the Lord thy God redeemed thee thence; therefore do I command thee to do this thing.
005	DEU	024	019	When thou cuttest down thy harvest in thy field, and forgettest a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go back to fetch it; for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow shall it be; in order that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all the work of thy hands.
005	DEU	024	020	When thou beatest thy olive-tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs again; for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow shall it be.
005	DEU	024	021	When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean the small fruit afterward; for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow shall it be.
005	DEU	024	022	And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bond-man in the land of Egypt; therefore do I command thee to do this thing:
005	DEU	025	001	If there be a controversy between men, and they come nigh unto a court of justice, and they judge them; and they justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked:
005	DEU	025	002	Then shall it be, if the guilty man deserve to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face, according to the degree of his fault, by a [certain] number.
005	DEU	025	003	Forty stripes may he give him, not more; so that he shall not exceed to have him beaten above these with too many stripes, and thy brother be thus rendered vile before thy eyes.
005	DEU	025	004	Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he thresheth out the corn.
005	DEU	025	005	If brothers dwell together, and one of them die, and have no child: then shall the wife of the dead not be married abroad, unto a stranger; her husband's brother shall go in unto her, and take her to himself for wife, and perform the duty of a husband's brother unto her.
005	DEU	025	006	And it shall be, that the first-born whom she may bear shall succeed in the name of his brother who is dead; so that his name be not blotted out of Israel.
005	DEU	025	007	And if the man have no desire to take his sister-in-law: then shall his sister-in-law go up to the gate unto the elders, and say, My husband's brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel, he will not perform on me the duty of a husband's brother.
005	DEU	025	008	Then shall the elders of his city call him, and speak unto him; and if he persist, and say, I have no desire to take her:
005	DEU	025	009	Then shall his sister-in-law come nigh unto him in the presence of the elders, and pull his shoe from off his foot, and spit out before him, and shall commence and say, Thus shall be done unto that man that will not build up his brother's house.
005	DEU	025	010	And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of the barefooted.
005	DEU	025	011	When men strive together one with the other, and the wife of the one draweth near to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh him by the secrets:
005	DEU	025	012	Then shalt thou cut off her hand, thy eye shall not have pity.
005	DEU	025	013	Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and a small.
005	DEU	025	014	Thou shalt not have in thy house divers measures, a great and a small.
005	DEU	025	015	A perfect and just weight shalt thou have, a perfect and just measure shalt thou have; in order that thy days may be prolonged in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee;
005	DEU	025	016	For an abomination of the Lord thy God is every one that doth such things, every one that acteth unrighteously.
005	DEU	025	017	Remember what 'Amalek did unto thee, by the way, at your coming forth out of Egypt;
005	DEU	025	018	How he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee, all that were feeble behind thee, when thou was faint and weary; and he feared not God.
005	DEU	025	019	And it shall come to pass, when the Lord thy God giveth thee rest from all thy enemies round about, in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it, that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of 'Amalek from under the heavens: thou shalt not forget.
005	DEU	026	001	And it shall come to pass, when thou art come in unto the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and thou hast taken possession of it, and dwellest therein:
005	DEU	026	002	That thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the soil, which thou shalt bring in from thy land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, and shalt put it in a basket; and thou shalt go unto the place which the Lord thy God will choose to let his name dwell there.
005	DEU	026	003	And thou shalt come unto the priest that may be in those days, and thou shalt say unto him, I give thanks this day unto the Lord thy God, that I am come into the land which the Lord swore unto our fathers to give to us.
005	DEU	026	004	And the priest shall take the basket out of thy hand, and set it down before the altar of the Lord thy God.
005	DEU	026	005	And thou shalt commence and say before the Lord thy God, A Syrian, wandering about, was my father, and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there with a family few in number, and he became there a nation, great, mighty, and numerous.
005	DEU	026	006	And the Egyptians treated us ill, and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard labor;
005	DEU	026	007	And then we cried unto the Eternal, the God of our fathers; and the Lord heard our voice, and looked on our affliction, and our trouble, and our oppression;
005	DEU	026	008	And the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terror, and with signs, and with wonders;
005	DEU	026	009	And he brought us unto this place, and gave unto us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey.
005	DEU	026	010	And now, behold, I have brought the first of the fruits of the soil, which thou hast given me, O Lord; and thou shalt set it down before the Lord thy God, and prostrate thyself before the Lord thy God;
005	DEU	026	011	And thou shalt rejoice with every good thing which the Lord thy God hath given unto thee, and unto thy house, thou, with the Levite, and the stranger that is in the midst of thee.
005	DEU	026	012	When thou hast made an end of giving away all the tithe of thy produce in the third year, the year of the tithing, and hast given it unto the Levite, to the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow, and they have eaten it within thy gates, and are satisfied:
005	DEU	026	013	Then shalt thou say before the Lord thy God, I have removed away the hallowed things out of the house, and I have also given them unto the Levite, and unto the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all thy commandment which thou hast commanded me; I have not deviated from thy commandments, and I have not forgotten;
005	DEU	026	014	I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I removed away aught thereof in an unclean state, nor have I given aught thereof for the dead: I have hearkened to the voice of the Lord my God, I have done all, just as thou hast commanded me.
005	DEU	026	015	Look down from the habitation of thy holiness, from the heavens, and bless thy people Israel, and the soil which thou hast given unto us, as thou hast sworn unto our fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey.
005	DEU	026	016	This day the Lord thy God commandeth thee to do these statutes and ordinances; and thou shalt keep and do them with all thy heart, and with all thy soul.
005	DEU	026	017	Thou hast this day acknowledged the Lord, that he is thy God, and that thou wilt walk in his ways, and keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his ordinances, and hearken unto his voice;
005	DEU	026	018	And the Lord hath acknowledged thee this day, that thou art unto him a peculiar people, as he hath spoken unto thee, and that thou shouldst keep all his commandments;
005	DEU	026	019	So that he may set thee highest above all nations that he hath made, in praise, and in name, and in honor; and that thou mayest be a holy people unto the Lord thy God, as he hath spoken.
005	DEU	027	001	And Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, Keep the whole commandment which I command you this day.
005	DEU	027	002	And it shall be on the day when ye pass over the Jordan unto the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, that thou shalt set up for thyself great stones, and cover them with plaster;
005	DEU	027	003	And thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law, so soon as thou art passed over; in order that thou mayest go in unto the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, a land flowing with milk and honey; as the Lord, the God of thy fathers, hath spoken unto thee.
005	DEU	027	004	And it shall be so soon as ye are gone over the Jordan, that ye shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, on mount 'Ebal; and thou shalt cover them with plaster.
005	DEU	027	005	And thou shalt build there an altar unto the Lord thy God, an altar of stones: thou shalt not lift up any iron tool upon them.
005	DEU	027	006	Of whole stones shalt thou build the altar of the Lord thy God; and thou shalt offer thereupon burnt-offerings unto the Lord thy God;
005	DEU	027	007	And thou shalt slay peace-offerings, and eat [them] there; and thou shalt rejoice before the Lord thy God.
005	DEU	027	008	And thou shalt write upon the statues all the words of this law, very plainly.
005	DEU	027	009	And Moses with the priests, the Levites, spoke unto all Israel, saying, Be attentive, and hearken, O Israel! this day art thou become a people unto the Lord thy God.
005	DEU	027	010	Thou shalt therefore hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, and do his commandments and his statutes, which I command thee this day.
005	DEU	027	011	And Moses commanded the people on the same day, saying,
005	DEU	027	012	These shall stand upon mount Gerizzim to bless the people, when ye are come over the Jordan: Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin.
005	DEU	027	013	And these shall stand for the sake of the curse upon mount 'Ebal: Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.
005	DEU	027	014	And the Levites shall commence, and say unto all the men of Israel with a loud voice,
005	DEU	027	015	Cursed be the man who maketh a graven or molten image, the abomination of the Lord, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and putteth it in a secret place; and all the people shall answer, and say, Amen.
005	DEU	027	016	Cursed be he that holdeth in light esteem his father or his mother; and all the people shall say, Amen.
005	DEU	027	017	Cursed be he that removeth the landmark of his neighbor; and all the people shall say, Amen.
005	DEU	027	018	Cursed be he that causeth the blind to wander out of the way; and all the people shall say, Amen.
005	DEU	027	019	Cursed be he that perverteth the cause of the stranger, of the fatherless, and of the widow; and all the people shall say, Amen.
005	DEU	027	020	Cursed be he that lieth with his father's wife; because he uncovereth his father's skirt; and all the people shall say, Amen.
005	DEU	027	021	Cursed be he that lieth with any manner of beast; and all the people shall say, Amen.
005	DEU	027	022	Cursed be he that lieth with his sister, the daughter of his father, or the daughter of his mother; and all the people shall say, Amen.
005	DEU	027	023	Cursed be he that lieth with his mother-in-law; and all the people shall say, Amen.
005	DEU	027	024	Cursed be he that smiteth his neighbor secretly; and all the people shall say, Amen.
005	DEU	027	025	Cursed be he that taketh a bribe to slay a person, an innocent blood; and all the people shall say, Amen.
005	DEU	027	026	Cursed be he that executeth not the words of this law to do them; and all the people shall say, Amen.
005	DEU	028	001	And it shall come to pass, if thou wilt hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to observe to do all his commandments which I command thee this day, that the Lord thy God will set thee highest above all nations of the earth.
005	DEU	028	002	And all these blessings shall come upon thee, and overtake thee; because thou wilt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God.
005	DEU	028	003	Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be in the field.
005	DEU	028	004	Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, and the fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy cattle, and the young of thy flocks.
005	DEU	028	005	Blessed shall be thy basket and thy kneading-through.
005	DEU	028	006	Blessed shalt thou be at thy coming in, and blessed shalt thou be at thy going out.
005	DEU	028	007	The Lord will cause thy enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face: on one way shall they come out against thee, and on seven ways shall they flee before thee.
005	DEU	028	008	The Lord will command upon thee the blessing in thy storehouse, and in all the acquisitions of thy hand; and he trill bless thee in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.
005	DEU	028	009	The Lord will raise thee up unto himself as a holy people, as he hath sworn unto thee; if thou wilt keep the commandments of the Lord thy God, and walk in his ways.
005	DEU	028	010	And all the nations of the earth shall see, that thou art called by the name of the Lord; and they shall be afraid of thee.
005	DEU	028	011	And the Lord will make thee pre-eminent for good, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground, in the land which the Lord swore unto thy fathers to give unto thee.
005	DEU	028	012	The Lord will open unto thee his good treasure, the heaven, to give the rain of thy land in its season, and to bless all the work of thy hand; and thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow.
005	DEU	028	013	And the Lord will constitute thee the head, and not the tail; and thou shalt only be uppermost, and thou shalt not be beneath; if thou wilt hearken unto the commandments of the Lord thy God, which I command thee this day to observe and to do;
005	DEU	028	014	And thou wilt not go aside from all the words which I command thee this day, to the right, or to the left, to go after strange gods, to serve them.
005	DEU	028	015	But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day: that all these curses shall come upon thee, and overtake thee.
005	DEU	028	016	Cursed shalt thou be in the city, and cursed shalt thou be in the field.
005	DEU	028	017	Cursed shall be thy basket and thy kneading-trough.
005	DEU	028	018	Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy land, the increase of thy cattle, and the young of the flocks.
005	DEU	028	019	Cursed shalt thou be at thy coming in, and cursed shalt thou be at thy going out.
005	DEU	028	020	The Lord will send out against thee misfortune, confusion, and failure, in all the occupation of thy hand which thou mayest engage in; until thou be destroyed, and until thou perish quickly; because of the wickedness of thy doings, that thou hast forsaken me.
005	DEU	028	021	The Lord will cause the pestilence to cleave unto thee, until it have consumed thee from off the land, whither thou goest to possess it.
005	DEU	028	022	The Lord will smite thee with consumption, and with fever, and with inflammation, and with extreme burning, and with drought, and with blasting, and with mildew; and they shall pursue thee until thou be lost.
005	DEU	028	023	And thy heavens that are over thy head shall be copper, and the earth that is under thee shall be iron.
005	DEU	028	024	The Lord will give as the rain of thy land powder and dust: from heaven shall it come down upon thee, until thou be destroyed.
005	DEU	028	025	The Lord will cause thee to be smitten before thy enemies: on one way shalt thou go out against them, and on seven ways shalt thou flee before them; and thou shalt become a horror unto all the kingdoms of the earth.
005	DEU	028	026	And thy carcass shall become food unto all the fowls of the heavens, and unto the beasts of the earth, but with no one to scare them away.
005	DEU	028	027	The Lord will smite thee with the inflammatory disease of Egypt, and with the hemorrhoids, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof thou shalt not be able to be healed.
005	DEU	028	028	The Lord will sinite thee with madness, and with blindness, and with confusion of heart;
005	DEU	028	029	And thou shalt grope about at noonday, as the blind gropeth about in the darkness, and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways; and thou shalt be only oppressed and robbed all the days, but with no one to help.
005	DEU	028	030	A wife wilt thou betroth, and another man shall lie with her; a house wilt thou build, and thou shalt not dwell therein; a vineyard wilt thou plant, and thou shalt not redeem it.
005	DEU	028	031	Thy ox shall be slain before thy eyes, and thou shalt not eat thereof; thy ass shall be violently taken away from before thy face, and shall not be brought back to thee; thy sheep shall be given unto thy enemies, without any one to help thee.
005	DEU	028	032	Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people, and thy eyes shall look on, and fail with longing for them all the day long; but without any power in thy hand.
005	DEU	028	033	The fruit of thy soil, and all thy exertion, shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up; and thou shalt only be oppressed and crushed all the days.
005	DEU	028	034	And thou shalt become mad from the sight of thy eyes which thou wilt see.
005	DEU	028	035	The Lord will smite thee with a sore inflammation upon the knees, and upon the legs, of which thou shalt not be able to be healed, from the sole of thy foot unto the top of thy head.
005	DEU	028	036	The Lord will drive thee, and thy king whom thou wilt set over thee, unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers have known; and thou wilt serve there strange gods, of wood and stone.
005	DEU	028	037	And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a by-word, among all the nations whither the Lord will lead thee.
005	DEU	028	038	Much seed wilt thou carry out into the field, yet but little shalt thou gather in; for the locust shall consume it.
005	DEU	028	039	Vineyards wilt thou plant and dress; but wine shalt thou not drink nor lay up; for the worms shall eat them.
005	DEU	028	040	Olive-trees wilt thou have throughout all thy borders; but with the oil shalt thou not anoint thyself; for thy olive shall cast the fruit.
005	DEU	028	041	Sons and daughters wilt thou beget; but they shall not remain thine: for they shall go into captivity.
005	DEU	028	042	All thy trees and the fruit of thy land shall the cricket strip bare.
005	DEU	028	043	The stranger that is in the midst of thee shall get up above thee higher and higher; but thou shalt come down lower and lower;
005	DEU	028	044	He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him; he shall become the head, and thou shalt become the tail.
005	DEU	028	045	And there shall come upon thee all these curses, and they shall pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou didst not hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which he hath commanded thee;
005	DEU	028	046	And they shall remain on thee for a sign and for a token, and on thy seed, for ever.
005	DEU	028	047	For the reason that thou didst not serve the Lord thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, while there was an abundance of all things;
005	DEU	028	048	Therefore shalt thou serve thy enemies whom the Lord will send out against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of every thing; and they will put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until they have destroyed thee.
005	DEU	028	049	The Lord will bring up against thee a nation from afar, from the end of the earth, as the eagle rusheth down; a nation whose tongue thou wilt not understand;
005	DEU	028	050	A nation of a fierce countenance, that will not have respect for the old, nor show favor to the young;
005	DEU	028	051	And it will eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy soil, until thou be destroyed; so that it will not leave unto thee corn, wine, or oil, the increase of thy cattle, or the young of thy flocks, until it have ruined thee.
005	DEU	028	052	And it will besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and strong walls come down, wherein thou trustest, throughout all thy land; and it will besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land, which the Lord thy God hath given thee.
005	DEU	028	053	And thou shalt eat the fruit of thy own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters, whom the Lord thy God hath given thee, in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thy enemy will distress thee.
005	DEU	028	054	The man that is the most tender among thee, and who is very delicate, —his eye shall look enviously toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children whom he may spare;
005	DEU	028	055	So as not to give to any of them of the flesh of his children which he may eat; because there is nothing left unto him, in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thy enemy will distress thee in all thy gates.
005	DEU	028	056	The woman, the most tender among thee, and the most delicate, who hath never adventured to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, —her eye shall look enviously toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter,
005	DEU	028	057	And toward her young one that is come from between her feet, and toward her children which she hath born; for she shall eat them for want of every thing secretly, in the siege and in the straitness, wherewith thy enemy will distress thee in thy gates.
005	DEU	028	058	If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law which are written in this book; to fear this glorious and fearful name, the Lord thy God:
005	DEU	028	059	Then will the Lord render peculiar thy plagues, and the plagues of thy seed, plagues great, and of long continuance, and sicknesses sore, and of long continuance.
005	DEU	028	060	And he will bring back upon thee all the diseases of Egypt, of which thou wast afraid; and they shall cleave unto thee.
005	DEU	028	061	Also every sickness, and every plague which is not written in the book of this law, will the Lord bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed.
005	DEU	028	062	And ye shall be left but few in number, instead of that ye once were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because thou didst not hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God.
005	DEU	028	063	And it shall come to pass, that, as the Lord rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you, so will the Lord rejoice over you to bring you to nought, and to destroy you; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it.
005	DEU	028	064	And the Lord will scatter thee among all the nations, from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth; and there wilt thou serve strange gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, even wood and stone.
005	DEU	028	065	And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, and there shall not be any rest for the sole of thy foot: and the Lord will give thee there a trembling heart, and a failing of eyes, and a faintness of soul.
005	DEU	028	066	And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt be in dread day and night, and thou shalt have no confidence of thy life;
005	DEU	028	067	In the morning thou wilt say, Who would but grant that it were only evening! and at evening thou wilt say, Who would but grant that it were only morning! from the dread of thy heart which thou wilt experience, and from the sight of thy eyes which thou wilt see.
005	DEU	028	068	And the Lord will bring thee back to Egypt in ships, by the way whereof I have spoken unto thee, Thou shalt no more see it again: and there will ye offer yourselves for sale unto your enemies for bond-men and bond-women, without any one to buy you.
005	DEU	029	001	These are the words of the covenant, which the Lord commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant which he had made with them in Horeb.
005	DEU	029	002	And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye yourselves have seen all that the Lord hath done before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all his land;
005	DEU	029	003	The great proofs which thy eyes have seen, those great signs, and miracles:
005	DEU	029	004	Yet the Lord gave you not a heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, until this day.
005	DEU	029	005	And I have led you forty years in the wilderness; your clothes did not fall worn out from off you, and thy shoe did not fall worn out from off thy foot.
005	DEU	029	006	Bread have ye not eaten, and wine or strong drink have ye not drunk; in order that ye might understand that I am the Lord your God.
005	DEU	029	007	And when ye came unto this place, Sichon the king of Cheshbon, and 'Og the king of Bashan went out against us unto battle, and we smote them:
005	DEU	029	008	And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of the Menassites.
005	DEU	029	009	Keep ye therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye may prosper in all that ye do.
005	DEU	029	010	Ye are standing this day, all of you, before the Lord your God; your heads of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, all the men of Israel,
005	DEU	029	011	Your little ones, your wives, and thy stranger that is in the midst of thy camp, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water:
005	DEU	029	012	That thou shouldst enter into the covenant of the Lord thy God, and into his oath of denunciation, which the Lord thy God maketh with thee this day.
005	DEU	029	013	In order to raise thee up today unto himself for a people, and that he may be unto thee a God, as he hath spoken unto thee, and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
005	DEU	029	014	And not with you alone do I make this covenant and this oath;
005	DEU	029	015	But with him that is standing here with us this day before the Lord our God, and with him that is not here with us this day.
005	DEU	029	016	(For ye know how we dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we passed through the nations through which ye have passed;
005	DEU	029	017	And ye saw their abominations, and their idols, of wood and stone, silver and gold, which they had with them:)
005	DEU	029	018	So that there may not be among you a man, or a woman, or a family, or a tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the Lord our God, to go to serve the gods of these nations; that there may not be among you a root that beareth abundantly poison and wormwood.
005	DEU	029	019	And it might come to pass, when he heareth the words of this denunciation, that he would bless himself in his heart, saying, There will be peace unto me, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart; in order that the indulgence of the passions may appease the thirst [for them]:
005	DEU	029	020	The Lord will not pardon him; but then the anger of the Lord and his jealousy will smoke against that man, and there shall rest upon him all the curse that is written in this book; and the Lord will blot out his name from under the heavens.
005	DEU	029	021	And the Lord will single him out unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the denunciations of the covenant which is written in this book of the law.
005	DEU	029	022	And the latest generation, your children that will rise up after you, and the stranger that will come from a far land, will say, when they see the plagues of that land, and its sufferings with which the Lord hath smitten it;
005	DEU	029	023	[That] the whole soil thereof is brimstone, and salt, and a burning waste, which is not sown, and beareth not, and in which no kind of grass springeth up, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboyim, which the Lord overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath: —
005	DEU	029	024	Even all the nations will say, Wherefore hath the Lord done thus unto this land? whence the heat of this great anger?
005	DEU	029	025	Then shall men say, Because they had forsaken the covenant of the Lord, the God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt;
005	DEU	029	026	And they went and served other gods, and bowed down to them, gods which they knew not, and which he had not assigned unto them;
005	DEU	029	027	And the anger of the Lord was kindled against this land, to bring upon it the entire curse that is written in this book;
005	DEU	029	028	And the Lord plucked them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and he cast them into another land, as it is this day.
005	DEU	029	029	The secret things belong unto the Lord our God; but those things which are publicly known belong unto us and to our children for ever, to do all the words of this law.
005	DEU	030	001	And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou reflectest on them in thy heart among all the nations, whither the Lord thy God hath driven thee,
005	DEU	030	002	So that thou returnest unto the Lord thy God, and hearkenest unto his voice according to all that I command this day, thou and thy children, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul:
005	DEU	030	003	That then the Lord thy God will restore thy captivity, and have mercy upon thee; and he will again gather thee from all the nations, whither the Lord thy God hath scattered thee.
005	DEU	030	004	If thy outcasts be at the outmost parts of heaven, from there will the Lord thy God gather thee, and from there will he fetch thee:
005	DEU	030	005	And the Lord thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.
005	DEU	030	006	And the Lord thy God will circumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, in order that thou mayest live.
005	DEU	030	007	And the Lord thy God will put all these denunciations upon thy enemies, and on those that hate thee, who have persecuted thee.
005	DEU	030	008	And thou wilt return and hearken unto the voice of the Lord, and thou wilt do all his commandments which I command thee this day.
005	DEU	030	009	And the Lord thy God will make thee pre-eminent in every work of thy hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy land, for good; for the Lord will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers;
005	DEU	030	010	If thou wilt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law; if thou wilt return unto the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul.
005	DEU	030	011	For this commandment which I command thee this day, is not hidden from thee, nor is it far off.
005	DEU	030	012	It is not in heaven; that thou shouldst say, Who will go up for us to heaven, and fetch it down unto us, and cause us to hear it, that we may do it?
005	DEU	030	013	Neither is it beyond the sea; that thou shouldst say, Who will go over the sea for us, and fetch it unto us, and cause us to hear it, that we may do it!
005	DEU	030	014	But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.
005	DEU	030	015	See, I have set before thee this day life and the good, death and the evil;
005	DEU	030	016	In that I command thee this day to love the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his ordinances; that thou mayest live and multiply; and that the Lord thy God may bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it.
005	DEU	030	017	But if thy heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hearken, and thou sufferest thyself to be drawn away, and thou bowest down to other gods, and servest them:
005	DEU	030	018	I announce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish; ye shall not remain many days upon the land, whither thou passest over the Jordan to go thither to possess it.
005	DEU	030	019	I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you this day, that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse; therefore choose thou life, in order that thou mayest live, both thou and thy seed;
005	DEU	030	020	To love the Lord thy God, to hearken to his voice, and to cleave unto him; for he is thy life, and the length of thy days; that thou mayest dwell in the land which the Lord swore unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give unto them.
005	DEU	031	001	And Moses went and spoke these words unto all Israel.
005	DEU	031	002	And he said unto them, I am a hundred and twenty years old this day; I am not able any more to go out and come in; for the Lord hath said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.
005	DEU	031	003	The Lord thy God it is who goeth over before thee; he will destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt dispossess them: Joshua it is who goeth over before thee, as the Lord hath spoken.
005	DEU	031	004	And the Lord will do unto them as he hath done to Sichon and to 'Og, the kings of the Emorites, and unto their land, whom he hath destroyed.
005	DEU	031	005	And the Lord will give them up before you; and ye shall do unto them according unto the whole of the commandment which I have commanded you.
005	DEU	031	006	Be strong and of a good courage, be not afraid and be not dismayed on account of them; for the Lord thy God it is that goeth with thee; he will not let thee fail, nor forsake thee.
005	DEU	031	007	And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him before the eyes of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage; for thou must go with this people unto the land which the Lord hath sworn unto their fathers to give unto them; and thou shalt divide it for them as a possession.
005	DEU	031	008	And the Lord it is that goeth before thee; he will be with thee, he will not let thee fail, nor will he forsake thee: fear not, nor be thou discouraged.
005	DEU	031	009	And Moses wrote down this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and unto all the elders of Israel.
005	DEU	031	010	And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of [every] seven years, at the fixed time of the year of release, on the feast of tabernacles,
005	DEU	031	011	When all Israel come to appear before the Lord thy God in the place which he will choose, shalt thou read this law in the presence of all Israel in their hearing.
005	DEU	031	012	Assemble the people together, the men, and the women, and the children, and thy stranger that is within thy gates; in order that they may hear, and in order that they may learn how they are to fear the Lord your God, and observe to do all the words of this law;
005	DEU	031	013	And that their children, who have not yet any knowledge, may hear, and learn to fear the Lord your God, all the days which ye live in the land whither ye go over the Jordan to possess it.
005	DEU	031	014	And the Lord said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou must die; call Joshua, and place yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation, that I may give him a charge: and Moses and Joshua went, and placed themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation.
005	DEU	031	015	And the Lord appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of cloud; and the pillar of cloud stood at the door of the tabernacle.
005	DEU	031	016	And the Lord said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers: and then will this people rise up, and go astray after the gods of the strangers of the land, whither they go to be in the midst of them, and they will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.
005	DEU	031	017	And my anger shall be kindled against them on that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be given to be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall overtake them; and they will say on that day, Is it not, because my God is not in the midst of me, that these evils have overtaken me?
005	DEU	031	018	But I will assuredly hide my face on that day on account of all the evils which they have wrought, because they have turned unto other gods.
005	DEU	031	019	Now therefore write ye for yourselves this song, and teach it the children of Israel, put it in their mouth; in order that this song may become for me a witness against the children of Israel.
005	DEU	031	020	For when I shall have brought them into the land which I have sworn unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and grown fat: then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant.
005	DEU	031	021	And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles have befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouth of their seed; for I know their inclination which they have shown, even this day, before I have brought them into the land which I have sworn.
005	DEU	031	022	And Moses wrote down this song on the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.
005	DEU	031	023	And he gave a charge unto Joshua the son of Nun, and said, Be strong and of a good courage; for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I have sworn unto them; and I will be with thee.
005	DEU	031	024	And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,
005	DEU	031	025	That Moses commanded the Levites, the bearers of the ark of the covenant of the Lord, saying,
005	DEU	031	026	Take this book of the law, and put it at the side of the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God, that it may remain there against thee for a witness.
005	DEU	031	027	For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, have ye been rebellious against the Lord, and how much more after my death?
005	DEU	031	028	Assemble unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers; and I will speak in their ears these words, and I will call as witnesses against them the heavens and the earth.
005	DEU	031	029	For I know that after my death ye will to a surety become corrupt, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and that the evil will befall you in the latter days, when ye do the evil in the eyes of the Lord, to incense him through the work of your hands.
005	DEU	031	030	And Moses spoke in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song, until they were ended.
005	DEU	032	001	Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and let the earth hear the words of my mouth.
005	DEU	032	002	My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew, as heavy rains upon the grass, and as showers upon herbs.
005	DEU	032	003	When I call on the name of the Lord, ascribe ye greatness unto our God.
005	DEU	032	004	He is the Rock, his work is perfect; for all his ways are just: the God of truth and without iniquity, just and upright is he.
005	DEU	032	005	The corruption is not his, it is the defect of his children, of the perverse and crooked generation.
005	DEU	032	006	Will ye thus requite the Lord, O people, worthless and unwise? is he not thy father who hath bought thee? is it not he who hath made thee, and established thee?
005	DEU	032	007	Remember the days of old, consider the years of former generations; ask thy father, and he will tell thee; thy elders, and they will say it unto thee:
005	DEU	032	008	When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of man: he set the bounds of the tribes according to the number of the sons of Israel.
005	DEU	032	009	For the portion of the Lord is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.
005	DEU	032	010	He found him in a desert land, and in the waste of the howling of the wilderness; he encircled him, he watched him, he guarded him as the apple of his eye.
005	DEU	032	011	As an eagle stirreth up his nest, fluttereth over his young, spreadeth abroad his wings, seizeth them, beareth them aloft on his pinions:
005	DEU	032	012	So did the Lord alone lead him, and there was not with him a stranger god.
005	DEU	032	013	He caused him to stride on the high places of the earth, and he ate the products of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty stone;
005	DEU	032	014	Cream of cows, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of wheat; and of the blood of the grape thou drunkest unmixed wine.
005	DEU	032	015	Thus did Yeshurun grow fat, and he kicked; [thou art grown fat, thick, fleshy;] and then he forsook the God who made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.
005	DEU	032	016	They incensed him with strange gods, with abominations they provoked him to anger.
005	DEU	032	017	They sacrificed unto evil spirits, things that are not god, gods that they know not, new ones lately come up, which your fathers dreaded not.
005	DEU	032	018	Of the Rock that begat thee thou wast unmindful, and forgottest the God that had brought thee forth.
005	DEU	032	019	And the Lord saw this, and he was angry; because of the provoking of his sons and of his daughters.
005	DEU	032	020	And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end will be; for a perverse generation are they, children in whom there is no faith.
005	DEU	032	021	They have moved me to wrath with things that are not god; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities; and I too will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a worthless nation.
005	DEU	032	022	For a fire is kindled in my anger, and it burneth unto the lowest deep; and it consumeth the earth with her products, and it setteth on fire the foundations of the mountains.
005	DEU	032	023	I will heap upon them miseries; all my arrows will I spend upon them.
005	DEU	032	024	They shall be wasted with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter deadly disease; also the tooth of beasts will I let loose against them, with the poison of serpents that crawl in the dust.
005	DEU	032	025	Without shall the sword destroy, and terror within the chambers, both the young man and the virgin, the suckling with the man of gray hairs.
005	DEU	032	026	I said, I would drive them into one corner, I would cause their remembrance to cease from among men:
005	DEU	032	027	Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their oppressors should mistake the truth, lest they should say, Our hand is high, and the Lord hath not wrought all this.
005	DEU	032	028	For a nation void of counsel are they, and there is no understanding in them.
005	DEU	032	029	If they were but wise, they would understand this, they would consider their latter end!
005	DEU	032	030	How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, and the Lord had delivered them up?
005	DEU	032	031	For not as our Rock is their rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.
005	DEU	032	032	For from the vine of Sodom is their vine, and from the fields of Gomorrah; their grapes are grapes of gall, they bear bitter clusters.
005	DEU	032	033	The poison of serpents is their wine, and the deadly venom of asps.
005	DEU	032	034	Behold! this is laid up in store with me, it is sealed up among my treasures!
005	DEU	032	035	Mine are vengeance and recompense, at the time that their foot shall slip; for nigh draweth the day of their calamity, and the future speedeth along for them.
005	DEU	032	036	For the Lord will espouse the cause of his people, and bethink himself concerning his servants: when he seeth that their power is gone, and the guarded and fortified axe no more.
005	DEU	032	037	Then will he say, Where are their gods, the rock in whom they trusted,
005	DEU	032	038	They that ate the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink-offerings? let them arise and help you, let them be a protection over you.
005	DEU	032	039	See now that I, even I, am he, ard there is no god with me: I alone kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal; and no one can deliver out of my hand.
005	DEU	032	040	For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.
005	DEU	032	041	When I whet my glittering sword, and my hand taketh hold on judgment: I will render vengeance unto my enemies, and those that hate me will I requite.
005	DEU	032	042	I will make my arrows drunken with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; from the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the crushed head of the enemy.
005	DEU	032	043	Speak aloud, O ye nations, the praises of his people; for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and vengeance will he render to his adversaries, and forgive his land, and people.
005	DEU	032	044	And Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.
005	DEU	032	045	And when Moses had made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:
005	DEU	032	046	He said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify against you this day, so that ye may command them your children, to observe to do all the words of this law.
005	DEU	032	047	For it is not a vain word for you; on the contrary, it is your life; and through this word shall ye live many days in the land, whither ye go over the Jordan to possess it.
005	DEU	032	048	And the Lord spoke unto Moses on that self-same day, saying,
005	DEU	032	049	Get thee up into this mountain of 'Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is in front of Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession;
005	DEU	032	050	And die on the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died on mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people;
005	DEU	032	051	Because ye trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of contention at Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.
005	DEU	032	052	For from afar shalt thou see the land; but thither shalt thou not go unto the land which I give the children of Israel.
005	DEU	033	001	And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses, the man of God, blessed the children of Israel before his death.
005	DEU	033	002	And he said, The Lord came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them: he shone forth from mount Paran, and he came from among myriads of saints; from his right hand he gave a fiery law unto them.
005	DEU	033	003	Yea, thou also lovedst the tribes; all their saints were in thy hand; and they, prostrate before thy feet, received thy words.
005	DEU	033	004	“The law which Moses commanded us, is the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.”
005	DEU	033	005	Thus became he king in Yeshurun, when the heads of the people were assembled, as one the tribes of Israel.
005	DEU	033	006	May Reuben live, and not die; and may not his men be few.
005	DEU	033	007	And this is [the blessing] of Judah, and he said, Hear, Lord, the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let the power of his hands contend for him; and be thou a help to him from his adversaries.
005	DEU	033	008	And of Levi he said, Thy Thummim and thy Urim are with thy holy man, whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;
005	DEU	033	009	Who said of his father and of his mother, I have not seen him; and who did not acknowledge his brothers, nor regarded his own children; for they observe thy word, and thy covenant they keep.
005	DEU	033	010	They shall teach thy ordinances unto Jacob, and thy law unto Israel: they shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt-sacrifice upon thy altar.
005	DEU	033	011	Bless, O Lord, his substance, and receive favorably the work of his hands: crush the loins of those that rise up against him, and those that hate him, that they cannot rise again.
005	DEU	033	012	And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the Lord [is he], he shall dwell in safety by him: he will shield him all the day long, and between his shoulders will he dwell.
005	DEU	033	013	And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the Lord be his land, through the precious gift of heaven, through the dew, and through the deep that coucheth beneath,
005	DEU	033	014	And through the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and through the precious things put forth by the moon,
005	DEU	033	015	And through the best things of the ancient mountains, and through the precious things of the everlasting hills,
005	DEU	033	016	And through the precious things of the earth and its fulness, and through the goodwill of him that dwelt in the thorn-bush: may this blessing come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the crown of the head of him that was separated from his brothers.
005	DEU	033	017	His first-born steer is adorned with glory, and his horns are like the horns of reem; with them shall he push nations together to the ends of the earth: and they are the myriads of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Menasseh.
005	DEU	033	018	And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and, Issachar, in thy tents.
005	DEU	033	019	They will call the tribes unto the mountain; there will they offer sacrifices of righteousness; for they will suck the abundance of the seas, and the treasures hid in the sand.
005	DEU	033	020	And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: like a lioness lieth he down, and teareth off the arm with the crown of the head.
005	DEU	033	021	And he provided the first part for himself, because there is the field of the law-giver, of the hidden; and he went forth at the head of the people: he executed the justice of the Lord, and his judgments with Israel.
005	DEU	033	022	And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's whelp, that leapeth forth from Bashan.
005	DEU	033	023	And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, and full of the blessing of the Lord, take thou possession of the west and the south.
005	DEU	033	024	And of Asher he said, More than [all] the children be Asher blessed: he shall be the most favored of his brethren, and bathe his foot in oil.
005	DEU	033	025	Iron and copper shall be thy bolts; and as thy [younger] days so shall thy old age be.
005	DEU	033	026	There is none like unto the God of Yeshurun, who rideth to help thee upon the heavens, and in his excellency upon the skies.
005	DEU	033	027	Thy refuge is the eternal God, and here beneath, the everlasting arms; and he thrust out the enemy from before thee; and he said, Destroy.
005	DEU	033	028	And then dwelt Israel in safety, alone, the fountain of Jacob; in a land of corn and wine; also its heavens shall drop down dew.
005	DEU	033	029	Happy art thou, O Israel! who is like unto thee, O people, saved by the Lord, the Shield of thy help, and who is the Sword of thy excellency! and thy enemies shall fawn upon thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high-places.
005	DEU	034	001	And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mount of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is before Jericho; and the Lord showed him all the land [from] Gil'ad unto Dan,
005	DEU	034	002	And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Menasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the western sea.
005	DEU	034	003	And the south, and the plain, the valley of Jericho, the city of palm-trees, unto Zoar.
005	DEU	034	004	And the Lord said unto him, This is the land which I swore unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it: I have let thee see it with thy eyes, but thither shalt thou not go over.
005	DEU	034	005	And Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab, according to the order of the Lord.
005	DEU	034	006	And he buried him in the valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth-peor; but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.
005	DEU	034	007	And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died; his eye was not dimmed, and his natural force had not abated.
005	DEU	034	008	And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days; and then were ended the days of weeping and mourning for Moses.
005	DEU	034	009	And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him; and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did, as the Lord had commanded Moses.
005	DEU	034	010	And there arose not a prophet since then in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face,
005	DEU	034	011	In respect to all the signs and the wonders, which the Lord had sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,
005	DEU	034	012	And in respect to all that mighty hand, and in all the great terrific deeds which Moses displayed before the eyes of all Israel.

# BOOK	006	JOS	Joshua	Joshua
006	JOS	001	001	And it came to pass after the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, that the Lord spoke unto Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, saying,
006	JOS	001	002	Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, pass over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, to the children of Israel.
006	JOS	001	003	Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses.
006	JOS	001	004	From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your boundary.
006	JOS	001	005	No man shall be able to stand up before thee all the days of thy life; as I was with Moses, so will I be with thee: I will not let thee fail, nor forsake thee.
006	JOS	001	006	Be strong and of a good courage; for thou shalt divide for an inheritance unto this people the land, which I swore unto their fathers to give to them.
006	JOS	001	007	Only be thou strong and very courageous, to observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant hath commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left; in order that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.
006	JOS	001	008	This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, in order that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein; for then shalt thou make thy way prosperous, and then shalt thou have good success.
006	JOS	001	009	Behold, I have commanded thee, Be strong and of good courage; be not dismayed, neither be thou discouraged; for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.
006	JOS	001	010	Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,
006	JOS	001	011	Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people, saying, Prepare yourselves provisions; for after only three days more ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the Lord your God giveth you, to possess it.
006	JOS	001	012	And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Menasseh, spoke Joshua, saying,
006	JOS	001	013	Remember the word which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, saying, The Lord your God hath granted you rest, and hath given you this land;
006	JOS	001	014	Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan; but ye shall pass over armed before your brethren, all the mighty men of valor, and help them;
006	JOS	001	015	Until the Lord shall have granted your brethren rest, as he hath done to you, and they also have taken possession of the land which the Lord your God giveth them: then shall ye return unto the land of your possession, and possess it, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you on this side of the Jordan, toward the rising of the sun.
006	JOS	001	016	And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou hast commanded us will we do, and whithersoever thou wilt send us will we go.
006	JOS	001	017	Entirely so as we have hearkened unto Moses, thus will we hearken unto thee: only the Lord thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.
006	JOS	001	018	Every man that doth rebel against thy order, and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou mayest command him, shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.
006	JOS	002	001	And Joshua, the son of Nun, had sent out from Shittim two men as spies, secretly, saying, Go ye, view the land and especially Jericho; and they went, and came unto the house of a woman, a harlot, whose name was Rachab, and they lodged there.
006	JOS	002	002	And it was told unto the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, men came in hither this night, of the children of Israel, to search out the country.
006	JOS	002	003	And the king of Jericho sent to Rachab, saying, Bring forth the men who are come to thee, who came to thy house; for, to search out all the country are they come.
006	JOS	002	004	But the woman had taken the two men, and hidden them; and she said, It is true, the men came unto me, but I knew not whence they were.
006	JOS	002	005	And it came to pass, about the time of shutting the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out; I know not whither the men are gone: pursue quickly after them, for ye can overtake them.
006	JOS	002	006	But she had brought them up to the roof, and had hidden them among the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.
006	JOS	002	007	And the men pursued after them, by the way to the Jordan unto the fords; and the gate was closed, as soon as those who pursued after them were gone out.
006	JOS	002	008	But they had not yet laid themselves down, when she came up unto them upon the roof.
006	JOS	002	009	And she said unto them, I know that the Lord hath given you the land, and that the terror of you hath fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land are become faint-hearted, because of you.
006	JOS	002	010	For we have heard, how that the Lord dried up the waters of the Red Sea before you, when ye went forth out of Egypt; and what ye have done unto the two kings of the Emorites, who were on the other side of the Jordan, unto Sichon and 'Og, whom ye have utterly destroyed.
006	JOS	002	011	And when we heard this, our heart melted, and there remained not any more courage in any man, because of you; for the Lord your God is alone God in the heavens above, and upon the earth beneath.
006	JOS	002	012	And now swear, I pray you, unto me by the Lord, because I have shown you kindness, that ye will also, for your part, show kindness, unto my father's house; and give me a sure token,
006	JOS	002	013	That ye will preserve the life of my father, and my mother, and my brothers, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.
006	JOS	002	014	And the men said unto her, Our life shall be [doomed] to death instead of yours, if ye tell not this our business; and it shall be, when the Lord giveth us the land, that we will show thee kindness and truth.
006	JOS	002	015	Then she let them down by a cord through the window; for her house was within the town wall, and within the wall she dwelt.
006	JOS	002	016	And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet with you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned; and afterward ye may go your way.
006	JOS	002	017	And the men said unto her, We will be blameless of this thy oath which thou hast caused us to swear.
006	JOS	002	018	Behold, when we come into the land, this line of scarlet thread shalt thou bind in the window by which thou hast let us down; and thy father, and thy mother, and thy brothers, and all thy father's household, thou must bring together unto thee into the house.
006	JOS	002	019	And it shall be, that whosoever will go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless; and whosoever will remain with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if a hand be laid upon him.
006	JOS	002	020	And if thou tell this our business, then will we be free of thy oath which thou hast caused us to swear.
006	JOS	002	021	And she said, According unto your words, so be it; and she dismissed them, and they departed; and she bound the scarlet line in the window.
006	JOS	002	022	And they went, and came unto the mountain, and they remained there three days, until the pursuers were returned; and the pursuers sought throughout all the way, but found nothing.
006	JOS	002	023	And the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and related to him all the things that had befallen them.
006	JOS	002	024	And they said unto Joshua, Truly the Lord hath given up into our hand all the country; for all the inhabitants of the country are already become faint-hearted because of us.
006	JOS	003	001	And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they broke up from Shittim, and came close to the Jordan, he and all the children of Israel; and they lodged there before they passed over.
006	JOS	003	002	And it came to pass at the end of three days, that the officers passed through the midst of the camp.
006	JOS	003	003	And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then shall ye break up from your place, and go after it.
006	JOS	003	004	Nevertheless there shall be a space between you and it, of about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, in order that ye may know the way by which ye must go; for ye have not passed this way heretofore.
006	JOS	003	005	And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves; for tomorrow will the Lord do wonders in the midst of you.
006	JOS	003	006	And Joshua said unto the priests, as followeth, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.
006	JOS	003	007	And the Lord said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to make thee great in the eyes of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so will I be with thee.
006	JOS	003	008	And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan, ye shall stand still in the Jordan.
006	JOS	003	009	And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Approach hither, and hear the words of the Lord your God.
006	JOS	003	010	And Joshua said, Hereby shall ye know that the living God is in the midst of you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Emorites, and the Jebusites.
006	JOS	003	011	Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into the Jordan.
006	JOS	003	012	And now take yourselves twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, one man each out of every tribe.
006	JOS	003	013	And it shall come to pass, that as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the Lord, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off, namely, the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand up as a wall.
006	JOS	003	014	And it came to pass, when the people broke up from their tents, to pass over the Jordan, and the priests the bearers of the ark of the covenant were before the people;
006	JOS	003	015	And as they that bore the ark were come up to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bore the ark were dipped in the edge of the water, [the Jordan, however, had overflowed all its banks all the time of harvest,]
006	JOS	003	016	That the waters which came down from above stood still and rose up as a wall, very far from the city Adam, which is beside Zarethan; and those that ran down toward the sea of the plain, the salt sea, failed, were cut off; and the people passed over opposite to Jericho.
006	JOS	003	017	And the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people had finished passing over the Jordan.
006	JOS	004	001	And it came to pass, when all the people had finished passing over the Jordan, That the Lord said unto Joshua, as followeth,
006	JOS	004	002	Take yourselves twelve men out of the people, one man each out of every tribe,
006	JOS	004	003	And command ye them, saying, Take yourselves hence out of the midst of the Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firmly, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging-place, where ye will lodge this night.
006	JOS	004	004	Then did Joshua call the twelve men, whom he had appointed out of the children of Israel, one man each out of every tribe:
006	JOS	004	005	And Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the Lord your God into the midst of the Jordan, and take yourselves up every man one stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel;
006	JOS	004	006	In order that this may be a sign among you, when your children ask in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones?
006	JOS	004	007	That ye shall answer them, That the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the Lord; when it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off; and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.
006	JOS	004	008	And the children of Israel did so as Joshua had commanded; and they took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, as the Lord had spoken unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel; and they carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.
006	JOS	004	009	Twelve stones also did Joshua set up in the midst of the Jordan, on the spot where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant had stood: and they have remained there unto this day.
006	JOS	004	010	But the priests who bore the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan, until every thing was finished that the Lord had commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua; and the people hastened and passed over.
006	JOS	004	011	And it came to pass, when all the people had finished passing over, that the ark of the Lord passed over with the priests in the presence of the people.
006	JOS	004	012	And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Menasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses had spoken unto them:
006	JOS	004	013	About forty thousand ready armed for war, did they pass over before the Lord unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.
006	JOS	004	014	On that day the Lord made Joshua great in the eyes of all Israel; and they feared him, as they had feared Moses, all the days of his life.
006	JOS	004	015	And the Lord said unto Joshua, as followeth,
006	JOS	004	016	Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of the Jordan.
006	JOS	004	017	And Joshua commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of the Jordan.
006	JOS	004	018	And it came to pass, when the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord were come up out of the midst of the Jordan, the soles of the feet of the priests were lifted up unto the dry land, that the waters of the Jordan returned unto their place, and flowed over all its banks, as on the preceding days.
006	JOS	004	019	And the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the extreme eastern border of Jericho.
006	JOS	004	020	And those twelve stones, which they had taken out of the Jordan, did Joshua set up in Gilgal.
006	JOS	004	021	And he said unto the children of Israel, thus, When your children shall ask in time to come their fathers, saying, What mean these stones?
006	JOS	004	022	Then shall ye let your children know, saying, On dry land did Israel pass over this Jordan;
006	JOS	004	023	That the Lord your God dried up the waters of the Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as the Lord your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over;
006	JOS	004	024	In order that all the nations of the earth may know the hand of the Lord, that it is mighty; in order that ye may fear the Lord your God all the days.
006	JOS	005	001	And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Emorites, who were on the side of the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, who were by the sea, heard that the Lord had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel, until they were passed over, that their heart melted, and there remained no more any courage in them, because of the children of Israel.
006	JOS	005	002	At that time the Lord said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.
006	JOS	005	003	And Joshua made himself sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of 'Araloth.
006	JOS	005	004	And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, the males, all the men of war, died in the wilderness on the way, after their going forth out of Egypt.
006	JOS	005	005	For all the people that came out were circumcised; but all the people that were born in the wilderness on the way at their going forth out of Egypt, they had not circumcised.
006	JOS	005	006	For during forty years the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness, till there was an end of all the people, the men of war, who were come out of Egypt, who had not obeyed the voice of the Lord; unto whom the Lord had sworn that he would not let them see the land, which the Lord had sworn unto their fathers that he would give unto us, a land flowing with milk and honey.
006	JOS	005	007	But their children he raised up in their stead: these did Joshua circumcise; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them on the way.
006	JOS	005	008	And it came to pass, when the whole people had all been circumcised, that they abode in their places in the camp till they were healed.
006	JOS	005	009	And the Lord said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. And he called the name of the place Gilgal unto this day.
006	JOS	005	010	And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and they prepared the passover-offering on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho.
006	JOS	005	011	And they ate of the corn of the land on the morrow after the passover-offering, unleavened cakes and parched corn, on the selfsame day.
006	JOS	005	012	And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the corn of the land; and the children of Israel had not any more manna; but they did eat of the product of the land of Canaan during that year.
006	JOS	005	013	And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, a man was standing over against him with his sword drawn in his hand; and Joshua went unto him, and said to him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?
006	JOS	005	014	And he said, No; for I am a captain of the host of the Lord: now am I come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and bowed himself, and said to him, What doth my lord speak unto his servant?
006	JOS	005	015	And the captain of the Lord's host said unto Joshua, Put off thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so.
006	JOS	006	001	Now Jericho was shut up, and barred up, because of the children of Israel: no one went out, and no one came in.
006	JOS	006	002	And the Lord said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thy hand Jericho and its king, even the mighty men of valor.
006	JOS	006	003	And ye shall compass the city, all the men of war, going round about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.
006	JOS	006	004	And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven cornets of rams' horns; and on the seventh day shall ye compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the cornets.
006	JOS	006	005	And it shall come to pass, that, when they blow a long blast with the ram's horn, when ye hear the sound of the cornet all the people shall utter a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him.
006	JOS	006	006	And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven cornets of rams' horns before the ark of the Lord.
006	JOS	006	007	And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let the armed men pass on before the ark of the Lord.
006	JOS	006	008	And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the seven priests, bearing the seven cornets of rams' horns before the Lord, passed on and blew with the cornets; and the ark of the covenant of the Lord followed them.
006	JOS	006	009	And the armed men went before the priests that blew the cornets, and the rereward came after the ark, going on, and blowing with the cornets.
006	JOS	006	010	And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you, Shout; and then shall ye shout.
006	JOS	006	011	So the ark of the Lord compassed the city, going round it once; and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.
006	JOS	006	012	And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the Lord.
006	JOS	006	013	And the seven priests bearing the seven cornets of rams' horns before the ark of the Lord went on continually, and blew with the cornets; and the armed men went before them; and the rereward came after the ark of the Lord, going on, and blowing with the cornets.
006	JOS	006	014	And they compassed the city on the second day once, and returned into the camp: so did they six days.
006	JOS	006	015	And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after this manner seven times; only on that day they compassed the city seven times.
006	JOS	006	016	And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priest blew with the cornets, that Joshua' said unto the people, Shout; for the Lord hath given you the city.
006	JOS	006	017	And the city shall be devoted, it, and all that is therein, to the Lord: only Rachab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house; because she did hide the messengers that we sent.
006	JOS	006	018	But ye, keep yourselves from the devoted things, lest ye devote and yet take of the devoted things, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.
006	JOS	006	019	And all the silver, and gold, and vessels of copper and iron, shall be holy unto the Lord: into the treasury of the Lord shall they come.
006	JOS	006	020	So the people shouted, when they blew with the cornets; and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the cornet, that the people uttered a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, and the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they captured the city.
006	JOS	006	021	And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and lamb, and ass, with the edge of the sword.
006	JOS	006	022	But unto the two men that had spied out the country, Joshua said, Go into the house of the woman, the harlot, and bring out thence the woman, and all belonging to her, as ye have sworn unto her.
006	JOS	006	023	And the young men, the spies, went in, and brought out Rachab, and her father, and her mother, and her brothers, and all belonging to her: and they brought out all her kindred, and they left them without the camp of Israel.
006	JOS	006	024	And the city they burnt with fire, and all that was therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of copper and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the Lord.
006	JOS	006	025	And Rachab the harlot did Joshua save alive, and her father's household, and all belonging to her; and she dwelt in the midst of Israel even unto this day; because she had hidden the messengers, whom Joshua had sent to spy out Jericho.
006	JOS	006	026	And Joshua adjured [the people] at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the Lord, that will rise up and build this city Jericho: with his first-born shall he lay its foundation, and with his youngest shall he set up its gates.
006	JOS	006	027	And the Lord was with Joshua; and his fame was spread throughout all the country.
006	JOS	007	001	But the children of Israel committed a trespass on the devoted things; for 'Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerach, of the tribe of Judah, took of the devoted things: and the anger of the Lord was kindled against the children of Israel.
006	JOS	007	002	And Joshua sent men from Jericho to 'Ai, which is beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Beth-el, and said unto them, thus, Go up and spy out the country. And the men went up and spied out 'Ai.
006	JOS	007	003	And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite 'Ai: do not fatigue all the people [to go] thither; for they are but few.
006	JOS	007	004	So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men; and they fled before the men of 'Ai.
006	JOS	007	005	And the men of 'Ai smote of them about thirty and six men; and they chased them from before the gate unto the stone-quarries, and smote them on the declivity [of the hill]; wherefore the heart of the people melted, and became as water.
006	JOS	007	006	And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell upon his face to the earth before the ark of the Lord until the evening, he with the elders of Israel, and they put dust upon their head.
006	JOS	007	007	And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord Eternal, wherefore hast thou caused this people to pass over the Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Emorites, to destroy us? and oh! that we had been content, and dwelt on the other side of the Jordan!
006	JOS	007	008	I pray thee, O Lord, what shall I say, since Israel have turned their back before their enemies!
006	JOS	007	009	And when the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, they will environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth; and what wilt thou do for thy great name?
006	JOS	007	010	And the Lord said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou upon thy face.
006	JOS	007	011	Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I have commanded them; and they have also taken of the devoted things, and have also stolen, and have also dissembled, and they have also put it into their own vessels.
006	JOS	007	012	Therefore will the children of Israel not be able to stand up before their enemies; their back will they turn before their enemies, because they have become accursed: I will not be any more with you, except ye destroy the accursed from among you.
006	JOS	007	013	Rise up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow; for thus hath said the Lord the God of Israel, An accursed thing is in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou shalt not be able to stand up before thy enemies, until ye have removed the accursed from among you.
006	JOS	007	014	And ye shall be brought near in the morning according to your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the Lord will seize shall come near according to its families; and the family which the Lord will seize shall come near by households; and the household which the Lord shall seize will come near by its men.
006	JOS	007	015	And it shall be, that he that is seized with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he, and all that he hath; because he hath transgressed the covenant of the Lord, and because he hath wrought wickedness in Israel.
006	JOS	007	016	So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel near by their tribes, and the tribe of Judah was seized;
006	JOS	007	017	And he brought near the family of Judah, and he seized the family of the Zarchites; and he brought near the family of the Zarchites by its men, and Zabdi was seized;
006	JOS	007	018	And he brought near his household by its men, and 'Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerach, of the tribe of Judah, was seized.
006	JOS	007	019	And Joshua said unto 'Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord, the God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me, I pray thee, what thou hast done: hide nothing from me.
006	JOS	007	020	And 'Achan answered Joshua, and said, Truly! I have indeed sinned against the Lord the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:
006	JOS	007	021	I saw among the spoil a handsome Babylonish mantle, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels in weight, and I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hidden in the earth in the midst of my tent, with the silver beneath the same.
006	JOS	007	022	Joshua thereupon sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hidden in his tent, and the silver beneath it.
006	JOS	007	023	And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and they laid them out before the Lord.
006	JOS	007	024	And Joshua took 'Achan the son of Zerach, and the silver, and the mantle, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his ox, and his ass, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had, and all Israel were with him, and they brought them up unto the valley of 'Achor.
006	JOS	007	025	And Joshua said, How hast thou troubled us! so shall the Lord trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burnt them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.
006	JOS	007	026	And they raised over him a great heap of stones [which is] unto this day; and the Lord turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of 'Achor, unto this day.
006	JOS	008	001	And the Lord said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou discouraged: take with thee all the people of war, and arise, go up to 'Ai; see, I have given into thy hand the king of 'Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land.
006	JOS	008	002	And thou shalt do to 'Ai and to its king as thou hast done unto Jericho and its king; only its spoil and its cattle shall ye take for booty unto yourselves; but lay thee an ambush for the city in its rear.
006	JOS	008	003	So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against 'Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valor, and sent them away by night.
006	JOS	008	004	And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city, in the rear of the city; go not very far from the city; and be ye all ready;
006	JOS	008	005	And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the city; and it shall come to pass that, when they come out against us, as at the first time, we will flee before them;
006	JOS	008	006	And they will come out after us, till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee from us as at the first time: and we will flee before them.
006	JOS	008	007	And then shall ye rise up from the ambush, and take possession of the city; and the Lord your God will deliver it in into your hand.
006	JOS	008	008	And it shall be, that as soon as ye have seized the city, ye shall set the city on fire; according to the word of the Lord shall ye do: see, I have commanded you.
006	JOS	008	009	And Joshua sent them off: and they went to lie in ambush, and remained between Beth-el and 'Ai, on the west side of 'Ai; but Joshua lodged that night among the people.
006	JOS	008	010	And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people, toward 'Ai.
006	JOS	008	011	And all the people of war that were with him went up, and drew nigh, and came opposite the city, and encamped on the north side of 'Ai; and the valley was between them and 'Ai.
006	JOS	008	012	And he took about five thousand men, and set them as an ambush between Beth-el and 'Ai, on the west side of 'Ai.
006	JOS	008	013	And the people, all the camp that was on the north of the city, and its ambush on the west of the city got ready; and Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.
006	JOS	008	014	And it came to pass, when the king of 'Ai saw this, the men of the city hastened and rose up early, and went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the time appointed, before the plain; but he knew not that there was an ambush against him in the rear of the city.
006	JOS	008	015	And Joshua and Israel feigned themselves beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.
006	JOS	008	016	And all the people that were in 'Ai were called together to pursue after them; and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.
006	JOS	008	017	And there was not a man left in 'Ai or Beth-el, that went not out after Israel; and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.
006	JOS	008	018	And the Lord said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in thy hand toward 'Ai; for into thy hand will I give it. And Joshua stretched out the spear which was in his hand toward the city.
006	JOS	008	019	And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he stretched out his hand; and they entered into the city, and took possession of it, and hastened and set the city on fire.
006	JOS	008	020	And the men of 'Ai turned [and looked] behind them, and they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven; and they had no power to flee this way or that way; and the people that had fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.
006	JOS	008	021	For when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had seized the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended: they turned back, and smote the men of 'Ai.
006	JOS	008	022	And the others issued out of the city against them; so that the Israelites had them in the middle, some on this side, and some on that side; and they smote them, until there was not left of them one that remained or escaped.
006	JOS	008	023	And the king of 'Ai they caught alive, and brought him to Joshua.
006	JOS	008	024	And it came to pass, that, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of 'Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they had pursued them, and when they were all fallen by the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, All the Israelites returned unto 'Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.
006	JOS	008	025	And [the number of] all that fell in that day, both of men and women, was twelve thousand, all the people of 'Ai.
006	JOS	008	026	And Joshua drew not back his hand, wherewith he had stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of 'Ai.
006	JOS	008	027	Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took as booty unto themselves, according to the word of the Lord which he had commanded Joshua.
006	JOS	008	028	And Joshua burnt 'Ai, and made it a ruinous heap of desolation for ever, even unto this day,
006	JOS	008	029	And the king of 'Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide; and at the going down of the sun, Joshua commanded, and they took his carcass down from the tree and cast it at the entrance of the city gate, and they raised over him a great heap of stones, [which is] even unto this day.
006	JOS	008	030	Then did Joshua build an altar unto the Lord, the God of Israel on mount 'Ebal,
006	JOS	008	031	As Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no one had lifted up any iron tool; and they offered thereon burnt-offerings unto the Lord, and sacrificed peace-offerings.
006	JOS	008	032	And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.
006	JOS	008	033	And all Israel, and their elders, and the officers, and their judges, stood on this side and on that side of the ark, opposite the priests the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord, the stranger no less than the native born: half of them turned toward mount Gerizzim, and the other half of them turned toward mount 'Ebal; as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded, to bless the people of Israel at first.
006	JOS	008	034	And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, all, just as it is written in the book of the law.
006	JOS	008	035	There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded, which Joshua did not read before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the stranger that walked in the midst of them.
006	JOS	009	001	And it came to pass, when all the kings that were on this side of the Jordan, in the mountain, and in the lowlands, and in all the coast of the great sea opposite Lebanon, the Hittites, and the Emorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, heard this,
006	JOS	009	002	That they assembled themselves all together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord.
006	JOS	009	003	And when the inhabitants of Gib'on heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and unto 'Ai,
006	JOS	009	004	They also did work wilily, and went and feigned to be messengers, and took old sacks for their asses, and wine-bottles, old, and rent, and bound up;
006	JOS	009	005	And [put] old and patched-up shoes upon their feet, and old garments upon themselves; and all the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy.
006	JOS	009	006	And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the men of Israel, We are come from a far-off country; and now make ye a covenant with us.
006	JOS	009	007	And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell in the midst of us; and how can we make a covenant with you:
006	JOS	009	008	And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua said unto them, Who are ye? and whence come ye!
006	JOS	009	009	And they said unto him, From a very far-off country are thy servants come, because of the name of the Lord thy God; for we have heard his fame, and all that he hath done in Egypt;
006	JOS	009	010	And all that he hath done to the two kings of the Emorites, that were beyond the Jordan, to Sichon the king of Cheshbon, and to 'Og the king of Bashan, who was at 'Ashtaroth.
006	JOS	009	011	Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country said to us, as followeth, Take provisions with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, Your servants are we: and now make ye with us a covenant.
006	JOS	009	012	This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; and now, behold, it is dry, and it is become mouldy:
006	JOS	009	013	And these wine-bottles, which we filled, when new, — but behold, they are now become rent; and these our garments and our shoes are become worn out by reason of the very long journey.
006	JOS	009	014	And the men took of their provisions, but the decision of the Lord they did not ask.
006	JOS	009	015	And Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them, to let them live; and the princes of the congregation swore unto them.
006	JOS	009	016	And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they were their neighbors, and that they dwelt in the midst of them.
006	JOS	009	017	And the children of Israel broke up, and came unto their cities on the third day; and their cities were Gib'on, and Kephirah, and Beeroth, and Kiryath-ye'arim.
006	JOS	009	018	And the children of Israel smote them not; because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the Lord, the God of Israel; but all the congregation murmured against the princes.
006	JOS	009	019	And all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by the Lord the God of Israel: and now we cannot touch them.
006	JOS	009	020	This will we do to them, and we will let them live, that there be no wrath upon us, on account of the oath which we have sworn unto them.
006	JOS	009	021	And the princes said unto them, Let them live: and they became hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation, as the princes had spoken unto them.
006	JOS	009	022	And Joshua called for them, and he spoke unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye deceived us, saying, We are very far from you: whereas ye dwell in the midst of us?
006	JOS	009	023	And now be ye cursed, and there shall not cease to be of you servants and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.
006	JOS	009	024	And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that the Lord thy God had commanded his servant Moses to give unto you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you; wherefore we were sore afraid for our lives because of you, and we have done this thing.
006	JOS	009	025	And now, behold, we are in thy hand; as it seemeth good and right in thy eyes to do unto us, so do.
006	JOS	009	026	And he did unto them thus; and he delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, and they slew them not.
006	JOS	009	027	And Joshua appointed them on that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the Lord, even unto this day, for the place which he should choose.
006	JOS	010	001	Now it came to pass, when Adoni-zedek, the king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had captured 'Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; [that] as he had done to Jericho and its king, so had he done to 'Ai and its king; and that the inhabitants of Gib'on had made peace with Israel, and were in the midst of them:
006	JOS	010	002	That they were greatly afraid; because Gib'on was a great city, like one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than 'Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty.
006	JOS	010	003	Therefore Adoni-zedek the king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham the king of Hebron, and unto Piram the king of Yarmuth, and unto Yaphia', the king of Lachish, and unto Debir the king of 'Eglon, saying,
006	JOS	010	004	Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gib'on; for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.
006	JOS	010	005	And the five kings of the Emorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Yarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of 'Eglon, assembled themselves together, and went up, they and all their camps, and encamped before Gib'on, and made war against it.
006	JOS	010	006	And the men of Gib'on sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Do not withdraw thy hand from thy servants: come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us; for all the kings of the Emorites that dwell in the mountains are assembled together against us.
006	JOS	010	007	And Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.
006	JOS	010	008	And the Lord said unto Joshua, Be not afraid of them; for into thy hand have I delivered them: there shall not stand a man of them before thee.
006	JOS	010	009	And Joshua came unto them suddenly; the whole night he went up from Gilgal.
006	JOS	010	010	And the Lord brought them in confusion before Israel, and they smote them with a great slaughter at Gib'on, and pursued them by the way of the ascent to Beth-choron, and smote them up to 'Azekah, and up to Makkedah.
006	JOS	010	011	And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, while they were in the declivity of Beth-choron, that the Lord cast down upon them great stones from heaven, up to 'Azekah, and they died: there were more who died by means of the hailstones than those whom the children of Israel had slain with the sword.
006	JOS	010	012	Then spoke Joshua to the Lord on the day when the Lord delivered up the Emorites before the children of Israel, and he said before the eyes of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gib'on; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ayalon.
006	JOS	010	013	And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Yashar? And the sun stood still in the midst of the heavens, and hastened not to go down about a whole day.
006	JOS	010	014	And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man; for the Lord fought for Israel.
006	JOS	010	015	And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.
006	JOS	010	016	But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah.
006	JOS	010	017	And it was told to Joshua, saying, The five kings have been found hidden in the cave at Makkedah.
006	JOS	010	018	And Joshua said, Roll great stones to the mouth of the cave, and set men over it to guard them;
006	JOS	010	019	But you, do ye not stay, pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them: suffer them not to enter into their cities; for the Lord your God hath delivered them into your hand.
006	JOS	010	020	And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of smiting them with a very great defeat, till they were all spent, and those that escaped had fled from them and entered into the fortified cities,
006	JOS	010	021	That all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: no one pointed against any man of the children of Israel his tongue.
006	JOS	010	022	Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out unto me those five kings out of the cave.
006	JOS	010	023	And they did so, and brought forth unto him those five kings out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Yarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of 'Eglon.
006	JOS	010	024	And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the chiefs of the men of war who had gone with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon their necks.
006	JOS	010	025	And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be disheartened, be strong and of good courage; for thus will the Lord do unto all your enemies against whom ye fight.
006	JOS	010	026	And Joshua smote them afterward, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees; and they remained hanging upon the trees until the evening.
006	JOS	010	027	And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hidden; and they placed great stones upon the mouth of the cave, [which remain] even until this very day.
006	JOS	010	028	And Joshua captured Makkedah on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and its king he devoted, them, and all the souls that were therein; he left none that escaped; and he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done unto the king of Jericho.
006	JOS	010	029	Then did Joshua, and all Israel with him, pass from Makkedah unto Libnah; and he fought against Libnah;
006	JOS	010	030	And the Lord delivered it also into the hand of Israel, with its king; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein; he left none in it that escaped; and he did unto its king as he had done unto the king of Jericho.
006	JOS	010	031	And Joshua, and all Israel with him, passed from Libnah unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it;
006	JOS	010	032	And the Lord delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel; and he captured it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein: just as he had done to Libnah.
006	JOS	010	033	Then came up Horam the king of Gezer to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none that escaped.
006	JOS	010	034	And Joshua and all Israel with him passed from Lachish unto 'Eglon; and they encamped against it, and fought against it;
006	JOS	010	035	And they captured it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword; and all the souls that were therein he devoted on that day: just as he had done to Lachish.
006	JOS	010	036	And Joshua and all Israel with him went up from 'Eglon unto Hebron; and they fought against it;
006	JOS	010	037	And they captured it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and its king, and all its cities, and all the souls that were therein; he left none that escaped, just as he had done to 'Eglon; and he devoted it, and all the souls that were therein.
006	JOS	010	038	And Joshua and all Israel with him returned to Debir; and fought against it;
006	JOS	010	039	And he captured it, and its king, and all its cities; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and devoted all the souls that were therein; he left none that escaped: as he had done to Hebron, so did he to Debir and to its king; and as he had done to Libnah and to its king.
006	JOS	010	040	And Joshua smote all the country, the mountain, and the south, and the lowlands, and the declivities, and all their kings; he left none that escaped; and all that breathed he utterly destroyed, as the Lord, the God of Israel had commanded.
006	JOS	010	041	And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea' even unto Gazzah, and all the country of Goshen, even up to Gib'on.
006	JOS	010	042	And all these kings and their land did Joshua capture at one time; because the Lord, the God of Israel fought for Israel.
006	JOS	010	043	And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.
006	JOS	011	001	And it came to pass, that, when Yabin the king of Chazor heard these things, he sent to Yobab the king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,
006	JOS	011	002	And to the kings that were at the north, on the mountains, and in the plains, south of Kinneroth, and in the lowlands, and in the district of Dor on the west,
006	JOS	011	003	To the Canaanites on the east and on the west, and to the Emorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites in the mountains, and to the Hivites under Chermon in the land of Mizpah.
006	JOS	011	004	And they went out, they and all their camps with them, much people, even as the sand that is upon the sea-shore in multitude, and with very many horses and chariots.
006	JOS	011	005	And all these kings assembled themselves together, and they came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.
006	JOS	011	006	And the Lord said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them; for tomorrow about this time will I give all of them up slain before Israel: their horses shalt thou hamstring and their chariots shalt thou burn with fire.
006	JOS	011	007	And Joshua and all the people of war with him came upon them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them.
006	JOS	011	008	And the Lord delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and pursued them unto great Zidon, and unto Missrephoth-mayim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none that escaped.
006	JOS	011	009	And Joshua did unto them as the Lord had said unto him: their horses he hamstringed and their chariots he burnt with fire.
006	JOS	011	010	And Joshua at that time turned back, and captured Chazor, and its kings he smote with the sword; for Chazor aforetimes was the head of all these kingdoms.
006	JOS	011	011	And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, and devoted them; there was not left any one having breath; and Chazor he burnt with fire.
006	JOS	011	012	And all the cities of these kings, and all their kings, did Joshua capture, and he smote them with the edge of the sword, and he devoted them, as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded.
006	JOS	011	013	But as for the cities that had been left standing in their strength, these did Israel not burn: save Chazor only did Joshua burn.
006	JOS	011	014	And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, did the children of Israel take as booty unto themselves; but all the men they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them: they left not any one having breath.
006	JOS	011	015	As the Lord had commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua: he left nothing undone of all that the Lord had commanded Moses.
006	JOS	011	016	And Joshua took all that land, the mountain, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the lowlands, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and its lowlands;
006	JOS	011	017	From the bald mountain that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Chermon; and all their kings he captured, and smote them, and slew them.
006	JOS	011	018	A long time did Joshua make war with all these kings.
006	JOS	011	019	There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gib'on: the whole they took by war.
006	JOS	011	020	For of the Lord it was to harden their heart, that they should come against Israel in battle, in order to destroy them utterly, that they might obtain no favor: but in order that he might exterminate them, as the Lord had commanded Moses.
006	JOS	011	021	And Joshua came at that time, and cut off the 'Anakim from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from 'Anab, and from the whole mountain of Judah, and from the whole mountain of Israel: with their cities did Joshua destroy them utterly.
006	JOS	011	022	There was none of the 'Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gazzah, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained some.
006	JOS	011	023	And Joshua' took the whole land, all just as the Lord had spoken unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel, according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war.
006	JOS	012	001	And these are the kings of the land whom the children of Israel smote, and whose land they took possession of on the other side of the Jordan, toward the rising of the sun, from the river Arnon unto mount Chermon, and all the plain on the east:
006	JOS	012	002	Sichon the king of the Emorites, who dwelt in Cheshbon, and ruled from 'Aro'er, which is upon the bank of the brook Arnon, and over the land in the middle of the brook, and from half Gil'ad, even unto the brook Yabbok, the boundary of the children of 'Ammon;
006	JOS	012	003	And over the plain up to the sea of Kinneroth on the east, and up to the sea of the plain, the salt sea on the east, on the way to Beth-hayeshimoth; and at the south, under the declivities of Pisgah;
006	JOS	012	004	And the territory of 'Og the king of Bashan, who was of the remnant of the Rephaim, that dwelt at 'Ashtaroth and at Edre'i,
006	JOS	012	005	And reigned over mount Chermon, and over Salchah, and over all Bashan, unto the border of the Geshurites and the Ma'achathites, and half Gil'ad, [to] the boundary of Sichon the king of Cheshbon.
006	JOS	012	006	These did Moses the servant of the Lord and the children of Israel smite; and Moses the servant of the Lord gave it for a possession unto the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Menasseh.
006	JOS	012	007	And these are the kings of the country whom Joshua and the children of Israel smote on this side of the Jordan on the west, from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon as far as the bald mountain, that goeth up to Seir; and Joshua gave it unto the tribes of Israel for a possession, according to their divisions;
006	JOS	012	008	In the mountains, and in the lowlands, and in the plain, and in the declivities, and in the wilderness, and in the south country: the Hittites, the Emorites, and the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
006	JOS	012	009	The king of Jericho, one; the king of 'Ai, which was beside Bethel one;
006	JOS	012	010	The king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;
006	JOS	012	011	The king of Yarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;
006	JOS	012	012	The king of 'Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;
006	JOS	012	013	The king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;
006	JOS	012	014	The king of Chormah, one; the king of 'Arad, one;
006	JOS	012	015	The king of Libnah, one; the king of 'Adullam, one;
006	JOS	012	016	The king of Makkedah, one; the king of Beth'el, one;
006	JOS	012	017	The king of Tappuach, one; the king of Chepher, one;
006	JOS	012	018	The king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one;
006	JOS	012	019	The king of Madon, one; the king of Chazor, one;
006	JOS	012	020	The king of Shimron-meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;
006	JOS	012	021	The king of Ta'anach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;
006	JOS	012	022	The king of Kedesh, one; the king of Yokne'am on Carmel, one;
006	JOS	012	023	The king of Dor in the district of Dor, one; the king of Goyim in Gilgal, one;
006	JOS	012	024	The king of Tirzah, one: in all thirty and one kings.
006	JOS	013	001	Now Joshua was old, well stricken in years; and the Lord said unto him, Thou art old, stricken in years, and of the land there remaineth yet very much to be taken possession of.
006	JOS	013	002	This is the land that yet remaineth: All the circles of the Philistines, and all [the land of the] Geshurites,
006	JOS	013	003	From the Shichor, which runneth before Egypt, even unto the boundary of 'Ekron northward, is counted to the Canaanites; the five lords of the Philistines; the Gazzathites, and the Ashdodites, the Eshkelonites, the Gittites, and the 'Ekronites; also the 'Avvim;
006	JOS	013	004	On the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Me'arah that belongeth to the Zidonians, up to Aphek, up to the border of the Emorites;
006	JOS	013	005	And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the rising of the sun, from Ba'al-gad under mount Chermon up to the entrance of Chamath.
006	JOS	013	006	All the inhabitants of the mountain from Lebanon unto Missrephoth-mayim, all the Zidonians: these will I drive out from before the children of Israel; only divide thou it by lot unto the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee.
006	JOS	013	007	And now divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes, and the half tribe of Menasseh.
006	JOS	013	008	With him the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance, which Moses gave unto them, beyond the Jordan eastward, as Moses the servant of the Lord hath given them;
006	JOS	013	009	From 'Aro'er, that is upon the bank of the brook Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the brook, and all the plain of Medeba up to Dibon;
006	JOS	013	010	And all the cities of Sichon the king of the Emorites, who reigned over Cheshbon, up to the border of the children of 'Ammon;
006	JOS	013	011	And Gil'ad, and the territory of the Geshurites and Ma'achathites, and all mount Chermon, and all Bashan up to Salchah;
006	JOS	013	012	All the kingdom of 'Og in Bashan, who reigned in 'Ashtaroth and in Edre'i; who had been left of the remnant of the Rephaim; and Moses smote them, and cast them out.
006	JOS	013	013	Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites and the Ma'achathites; but the Geshurites and the Ma'achathites continued to dwell in the midst of the Israelites until this day.
006	JOS	013	014	Only unto the tribe of Levi he gave no inheritance: the fire-offerings of the Lord, the God of Israel, are their inheritance, as he hath spoken unto them.
006	JOS	013	015	And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their families;
006	JOS	013	016	And their territory was from 'Aro'er, that is on the bank of the brook Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the brook, and all the plain by Medeba;
006	JOS	013	017	Cheshbon, and all its cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and Bamoth-ba'al, and Beth-ba'al-me'on,
006	JOS	013	018	And Yahzah, and Kedemoth, and Mepha'ath,
006	JOS	013	019	And Kiryathayim, and Sibmah, and Zereth-hashachar on the mount of the valley,
006	JOS	013	020	And Beth-pe'or, and the declivities of Pisgah, and Beth-hayeshimoth,
006	JOS	013	021	And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sichon the king of the Emorites, who reigned in Cheshbon, whom Moses smote with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Chur, and Reba', the dukes of Sichon, the dwellers of the country.
006	JOS	013	022	And Bil'am the son of Be'or, the soothsayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword among their slain.
006	JOS	013	023	And the boundary of the children of Reuben was the Jordan, and its bordering territory. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben after their families, the cities and their villages.
006	JOS	013	024	And Moses gave unto the tribe of Gad, unto the children of Gad according to their families;
006	JOS	013	025	And their territory was Ya'zer, and all the cities of Gil'ad, and half the land of the children of 'Ammon, up to 'Aro'er that is before Rabbah;
006	JOS	013	026	And from Cheshbon unto Ramath-mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Machanayim up to the border of Debir;
006	JOS	013	027	And in the valley, Beth-haram, and Beth-nimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sichon the king of Cheshbon, the Jordan and its bordering territory, up to the edge of the sea of Kinnereth on the other side of the Jordan eastward.
006	JOS	013	028	This is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their families, the cities and their villages.
006	JOS	013	029	And Moses gave unto the half tribe of Menasseh; and it belonged to the half tribe of the children of Menasseh after their families;
006	JOS	013	030	And their territory was from Machanayim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of 'Og the king of Bashan, and all the villages of Ya'ir, which are in Bashan, sixty cities;
006	JOS	013	031	And half Gil'ad and 'Ashtaroth, and Edre'i, the cities of the kingdom of 'Og in Bashan, [belonged] unto the children of Machir the son of Menasseh, even to the one half of the children of Machir after their families.
006	JOS	013	032	These are they to whom Moses did distribute an inheritance in the plans of Moab, on the other side of the Jordan, by Jericho, eastward.
006	JOS	013	033	But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance: the Lord the God of Israel is himself their inheritance, as he hath spoken unto them.
006	JOS	014	001	And these are the countries which the children of Israel obtained as an inheritance in the land of Canaan, which Elazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the divisions of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for an inheritance unto them,
006	JOS	014	002	By the lot as their inheritance: as the Lord had commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and the half tribe.
006	JOS	014	003	For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half tribe on the other side of the Jordan; but unto the Levites he had given no inheritance among them.
006	JOS	014	004	For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Menasseh and Ephraim; therefore they gave no portion unto the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, with their open spaces for their cattle and for their substance.
006	JOS	014	005	As the Lord had commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel, and so divided they the land.
006	JOS	014	006	And the children of Judah came near unto Joshua in Gilgal; and Caleb the son of Yephunneh the Kenizzite said unto him, Thou well knowest the word which the Lord spoke unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thyself in Kadesh-barnea'.
006	JOS	014	007	Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh-barnea' to spy out the land; and I brought him word again as it was in my heart.
006	JOS	014	008	But my brethren who had gone up with me caused the heart of the people to be faint; but I wholly followed the Lord my God.
006	JOS	014	009	And Moses swore on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy foot hath trodden shall belong to thee for an inheritance, and to thy children for ever; because thou hast wholly followed the Lord my God.
006	JOS	014	010	And now, behold, the Lord hath kept me alive, as he hath spoken: it is now forty and five years since the Lord spoke this word unto Moses, while Israel wandered in the wilderness; and now, behold, I am this day eighty and five years old.
006	JOS	014	011	I am yet this day as strong as I was on the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, and to go out, and to come in.
006	JOS	014	012	Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the Lord spoke on that day; for thou didst hear on that day that the 'Anakim were there, and great fortified cities: perhaps the Lord will be with me, and I shall drive them out, as the Lord hath spoken.
006	JOS	014	013	And Joshua blessed him, and gave Hebron unto Caleb the son of Yephunneh for an inheritance.
006	JOS	014	014	Therefore did Hebron become the inheritance of Caleb the son of Yephunneh the Kenizzite unto this day; for the cause that he had wholly followed the Lord the God of Israel.
006	JOS	014	015	And the name of Hebron was aforetimes Kiryatharba', who was the greatest man among the 'Anakim. And the land had rest from war.
006	JOS	015	001	And the lot for the tribe of the children of Judah after their families came by the border of Edom, with the wilderness of Zin, southward, as the uttermost southern boundary.
006	JOS	015	002	And their southern boundary was from the end of the salt sea, from the bay that bendeth southward:
006	JOS	015	003	And it went out to the south of the heights of 'Akrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side unto Kadesh-barnea, and passed along to Chezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compass to Karka';
006	JOS	015	004	And it passed on toward 'Azmon, and went out unto the river of Egypt; and the terminations of the boundary were at the sea: this shall be your southern boundary.
006	JOS	015	005	And the east boundary was the salt sea, unto the end of the Jordan. And the boundary in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the end of the Jordan;
006	JOS	015	006	And the boundary went up to Beth-choglah, and passed along by the north of Beth'arabah; and the boundary went up to Ebenbohan the son of Reuben;
006	JOS	015	007	And the boundary went up toward Debir from the Valley of 'Achor, and at the north it bent toward Gilgal, that is opposite the heights of Adummim, which is on the south side of the valley; and the boundary passed toward the waters of 'En-shemesh, and its terminations were at En-rogel;
006	JOS	015	008	And the boundary went up to the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the south side of the Jebusite, the same is Jerusalem; and the boundary went up to the top of the mount that lieth before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the valley of Rephaim northward;
006	JOS	015	009	And the boundary extended from the top of the mount unto the spring of the waters of Nephtoach, and went out to the cities of mount 'Ephron; and the boundary extended to Ba'alah, which is Kiryath-ye'arim;
006	JOS	015	010	And the boundary compassed from Ba'alah westward unto mount Seir, and passed along unto the side of mount Ye'arim, which is Kessalon, on the north side, and went down to Beth-shemesh, and passed on to Timnah;
006	JOS	015	011	And the boundary went out unto the side of 'Ekron northward; and the boundary extended to Shikron, and passed along to the mount of Ba'alah, and went out unto Yabneel; and the terminations of the boundary were at the sea.
006	JOS	015	012	And the west boundary was by the great sea, and the coast thereof. This is the boundary of the children of Judah round about according to their families.
006	JOS	015	013	And unto Caleb the son of Yephunneh he gave as a portion among the children of Judah, according to the order of the Lord to Joshua, Kiryath-arba' the father of 'Anak, which is Hebron.
006	JOS	015	014	And Caleb drove out from there the three sons of 'Anak, Sheshai, and Achiman, and Talmai, the children of 'Anak.
006	JOS	015	015	And he went up from there to the inhabitants of Debir; and the name of Debir before was Kiryath-sepher.
006	JOS	015	016	And Caleb said, He that will smite Kiryath-sepher, and capture it, to him will I give 'Achsah my daughter for wife.
006	JOS	015	017	And 'Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, captured it; and he gave him 'Achsah his daughter for wife.
006	JOS	015	018	And it came to pass, as she came thither, that she persuaded him to ask of her father a field: and she alighted from her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What aileth thee?
006	JOS	015	019	And she said, Give me a blessing; for a dry land hast thou given me: give me then also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
006	JOS	015	020	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families.
006	JOS	015	021	And the cities of the boundary line of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the border of Edom, on the south, were Kabzeel, and 'Eder, and Yagur,
006	JOS	015	022	And Kinah, and Dimonah, and 'Ad'adah,
006	JOS	015	023	And Kedesh, and Chazor, and Yithnan,
006	JOS	015	024	Ziph, and Telem, and Be'aloth,
006	JOS	015	025	And Chazor-chadattah, and Keriyoth-chezron, which is Chazor,
006	JOS	015	026	Amam, and Shema', and Moladah,
006	JOS	015	027	And Chazar-gaddah, and Cheshmon, and Beth-palet,
006	JOS	015	028	And Chazar-shual, and Beer-sheba, and Bizyotheyah,

006	JOS	015	030	And Eltolad, and Kessil, and Chormah,
006	JOS	015	031	And Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah,
006	JOS	015	032	And Lebaoth, and Shilchim, and 'Ayin, and Rimmon: in all twenty and nine cities, with their villages.
006	JOS	015	033	And in the lowlands, Eshtaol, and Zor'ah, and Ashnah.
006	JOS	015	034	And Zanoach, and 'En-gannim, Tappuach, and 'Enam,
006	JOS	015	035	Yarmuth, and 'Adullam, Sochoh, and 'Azekah,
006	JOS	015	036	And Sha'arayim, and 'Adithayim, and Gederah, and Gede-rothayim: fourteen cities with their villages.
006	JOS	015	037	Zenan, and Chadashah, and Migdalgad,
006	JOS	015	038	And Dil'an, and Mizpeh, and Yoktheel,
006	JOS	015	039	Lachish, and Bozkath, and 'Eglon,
006	JOS	015	040	And Cabbon, and Lachmass, and Kithlish,
006	JOS	015	041	And Gederoth, Beth-dagon, and Na'amah, and Makkedah: sixteen cities with their villages.
006	JOS	015	042	Libnah, and 'Ether, and 'Ashan,

006	JOS	015	044	And Ke'ilah, and Achzib, and Mareshah: nine cities with their villages.
006	JOS	015	045	'Ekron, with its towns and its villages:
006	JOS	015	046	From 'Ekron even unto the sea, all that lay alongside of Ashdod, with their villages.
006	JOS	015	047	Ashdod with its towns and its villages, Gazzah, with its towns and its villages, up to the brook of Egypt, and the great sea, and its territory.
006	JOS	015	048	And in the mountains, Shamir, and Yattir, and Sochoh,
006	JOS	015	049	And Dannah and Kiryath-sannah, which is Debir,
006	JOS	015	050	And 'Anab, and Eshtemoh, and 'Anim.
006	JOS	015	051	And Goshen, and Cholon, and Giloh: eleven cities with their villages.
006	JOS	015	052	Arab, and Dumah, and Esh'an,
006	JOS	015	053	And Vanum, and Beth-tappuach, and Aphekah,
006	JOS	015	054	And Chumtah, and Kiryath-arba', which is Hebron, and Zi'or: nine cities with their villages.
006	JOS	015	055	Ma'on, Carmel, and Ziph, and Yutah,
006	JOS	015	056	And Yizre'el, and Yokde'am, and Zanoach,
006	JOS	015	057	Kayin, Gib'ah, and Timnah: ten cities with their villages.
006	JOS	015	058	Chatchul, Beth-zur, and Gedor,
006	JOS	015	059	And Ma'arath, and Beth-'anoth, and Eltekon: six cities with their village.
006	JOS	015	060	Kiryath-baal, which is Kiryath-ye'arim, and Rabbah; two cities with their villages.
006	JOS	015	061	In the wilderness, Beth-ha'arabah, Middin, and Sechachah,
006	JOS	015	062	And Nibshan, and 'Ir-hammelach, and 'En-gedi: six cities with their villages.
006	JOS	015	063	As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem, these the children of Judah could not drive out; but the Jebusites dwelt with the children of Judah at Jerusalem, even unto this day.
006	JOS	016	001	And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from the Jordan by Jericho, unto the waters of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness that goeth up from Jericho by the mount Beth-el,
006	JOS	016	002	And [the boundary] went out from Beth-el to Luz, and passed along unto the boundary of the Arkites to 'Ataroth,
006	JOS	016	003	And went down westward to the boundary of the Yaphleti, unto the border of Beth-choron the lower, and to Gezer; and its terminations were toward the sea.
006	JOS	016	004	This did the children of Joseph, Menasseh and Ephraim, take as their inheritance.
006	JOS	016	005	And [this] was the boundary of the children of Ephraim according to their families; and the boundary of their inheritance on the east side was 'Atroth-addar, up to Beth-choron the upper;
006	JOS	016	006	And the boundary went out toward the sea to Michmethath on the north; and the boundary fetched a compass eastward unto Taanathshiloh, and passed by it on the east to Yanochah;
006	JOS	016	007	And it went down from Yanochah to 'Ataroth, and to Na'arath, and touched on Jericho, and went out at the Jordan.
006	JOS	016	008	From Tappuach westward the border went out unto the brook Kanah; and its terminations were toward the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim after their families;
006	JOS	016	009	And [in addition to this] the cities which were separated for the children of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the children of Menasseh, all the cities with their villages.
006	JOS	016	010	And they drove not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt among the Ephraimites until this day, and became tributary servants.
006	JOS	017	001	And then came the lot for the tribe of Menasseh; for he was the first-born of Joseph: to wit, for Machir the first-born of Menasseh, the father of Gil'ad; because he was a man of war, therefore he obtained Gil'ad and Bashan.
006	JOS	017	002	There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Menasseh after their families; for the children of Abi'ezer, and for the children of Chelek, and for the children of Assriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Chepher, and for the children of Shemida': these were the male children of Menasseh the son of Joseph after their families.
006	JOS	017	003	But Zelophchad, the son of Chepher, the son of Gil'ad, the son of Machir, the son of Menasseh, had no sons, but only daughters, and these are the names of his daughters, Machlah, and No'ah, Choglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
006	JOS	017	004	And they came near before Elazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The Lord commanded Moses to give unto us an inheritance among our brethren. And he gave them, according to the order of the Lord, an inheritance among the brethren of their father.
006	JOS	017	005	And there fell ten portions of Menasseh, beside the lands of Gil'ad and Bashan, which were on the other side of the Jordan;
006	JOS	017	006	Because the daughters of Menasseh obtained an inheritance among his sons: and the land of Gil'ad belonged to the rest of the sons of Manasseh.
006	JOS	017	007	And the boundary of Menasseh was from Asher to Michmethath, that lieth before Shechem; and the boundary went along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of 'En-tappuach.
006	JOS	017	008	To Menasseh belonged the land of Tappuach; but Tappuach on the borders of Menasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim;
006	JOS	017	009	And the boundary descended unto the brook Kanah, southward of the brook; these cities belonging to Ephraim are in the midst of the cities of Menasseh; and the boundary of Menasseh was on the north side of the river, and its terminations were toward the sea:
006	JOS	017	010	Southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was Menasseh's, and the sea was [there] his boundary; and on Asher they touched on the north, and on Issachar on the east.
006	JOS	017	011	And to Menasseh belonged in Issachar and in Asher Beth-shean and its towns, and Yible'am and its towns, together with the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of 'En-dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Ta'anach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns, namely the three districts.
006	JOS	017	012	Yet the children of Menasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of these cities; but the Canaanites succeeded to dwell in this land;
006	JOS	017	013	Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were become strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute; but they did not drive them out.
006	JOS	017	014	And the children of Joseph spoke unto Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion as an inheritance, seeing I am a numerous people, to which extent the Lord hath hitherto blessed me?
006	JOS	017	015	And Joshua said unto them, If thou art a numerous people, then get thee up to the wood country, and cut down [a space] for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim, if the mountain of Ephraim be too narrow for thee.
006	JOS	017	016	And the children of Joseph said, The mountain will not be enough for us; and chariots of iron are belonging to all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley, to those who are at Beth-shean and its towns, and to those who are in the valley of Yizre'el.
006	JOS	017	017	And Joshua said unto the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and to Menasseh, as followeth, Thou art a numerous people, and hast great power; thou shalt not have one lot only;
006	JOS	017	018	But the mountain shall be thine; it is indeed a wood, yet thou canst cut it down; and the terminations of it shall be thine; for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots, though they be strong.
006	JOS	018	001	And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh, and set up there the tabernacle of the congregation. And the land was subdued before them.
006	JOS	018	002	And there remained among the children of Israel, that had not yet received their inheritance, seven tribes.
006	JOS	018	003	And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long will ye show yourselves slack to go to take possession of the land, which the Lord the God of your fathers hath given to you!
006	JOS	018	004	Furnish for yourselves three men for each tribe; and I will send them out, and they shall arise, and walk through the land, and describe it according to their inheritance, and come again to me.
006	JOS	018	005	And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall remain on his boundary at the south, and the house of Joseph shall remain on their boundary at the north.
006	JOS	018	006	But you shall make a description of the land in seven parts, and bring it hither to me; and I will cast the lot for you here, before the Lord our God.
006	JOS	018	007	For to the Levites there is no portion among you; for the priesthood of the Lord is their inheritance; and Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of Menasseh have already received their inheritance beyond the Jordan, at the east, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave to them.
006	JOS	018	008	And the men arose, and went away; and Joshua charged those that went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and describe it, and return again to me; and here will I cast the lot for you before the Lord, in Shiloh.
006	JOS	018	009	And the men went and passed through the land, and described it according to the cities in seven parts in a book; and they came again to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh.
006	JOS	018	010	And Joshua cast the lot for them in Shiloh before the Lord; and Joshua divided there the land unto the children of Israel according to their divisions.
006	JOS	018	011	And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families; and the boundary of their lot came forth between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.
006	JOS	018	012	And their boundary was on the north side [starting] from the Jordan; and the boundary went up to the side of Jericho on the north, and went up through the mountains westward; and its terminations were at the wilderness of Beth-aven.
006	JOS	018	013	And the boundary went over from there toward Luz, to the south side of Luz, which is Beth-el; and the boundary descended to 'Atroth-addar, upon the mount that is on the south side of the lower Beth-choron.
006	JOS	018	014	And the border extended [thence], and fetched a compass to the west side, to the south of the mount that is before Beth-choron at the south; and its terminations were at Kiryath-ba'al, which is Kiryath-ye'arim, a city of the children of Judah: this was the west side.
006	JOS	018	015	And the south side commenced from the end of Kiryath-ye'arim, and the boundary went out on the west, and went out to the spring of the waters of Nephtoach:
006	JOS	018	016	And the boundary went down to the end of the mountain that is before the valley of the son of Hinnom, and which is in the valley of Rephaim at the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of the Jebusi on the south, and descended to 'Enrogel,
006	JOS	018	017	And extended northwardly, and went forth to 'En-shemesh, and went forth toward Geliloth, which is opposite to the ascent of Adummim, and descended to Eben-bohan the son of Reuben,
006	JOS	018	018	And passed along on this side opposite to 'Arabah northward; and went down unto 'Arabah;
006	JOS	018	019	And the boundary passed along to the side of Beth-choglah northward; and the terminations of the border were at the north bay of the Salt Sea at the south end of the Jordan: this was the south boundary.
006	JOS	018	020	And the Jordan bounded it on the east side. This was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by its boundaries round about, according to their families.
006	JOS	018	021	Now these were the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families, Jericho, and Beth-choglah, and 'Emekkeziz,
006	JOS	018	022	And Beth-ha'arabah, and Zemarayim, and Beth-el,
006	JOS	018	023	And Avvim, and Parah, and 'Ophrah,
006	JOS	018	024	And Kephar-ha'ammonah, and 'Ophni, and Geba': twelve cities with their villages.
006	JOS	018	025	Gib'on, and Ramah, and Beeroth,
006	JOS	018	026	And Mizpeh, and Kephirah, and Mozah,
006	JOS	018	027	And Rekem, and Yirpeel, and Taralah,
006	JOS	018	028	And Zela', Eleph, and Jebusi, which is Jerusalem, Gib'ath, and Kiryath: fourteen cities with their villages. This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families.
006	JOS	019	001	And then came forth the second lot for Simeon, for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families; and their inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of Judah.
006	JOS	019	002	And they obtained in their inheritance Beer-sheba', [or] Sheba', and Moladah,
006	JOS	019	003	And Chazar-shu'al, and Balah, and 'Ezem,
006	JOS	019	004	And Eltolad, and Bethul, and Chormah,
006	JOS	019	005	And Ziklag, and Beth-hamarcaboth, and Chazar-sussah,
006	JOS	019	006	And Beth-lebaoth, and Sharuchen: thirteen cities and their villages.
006	JOS	019	007	'Ayin, Rimmon, and 'Ether, and 'Ashan; four cities and their villages.
006	JOS	019	008	And all the villages that were round about these cities up to Ba'alath-beer, South Ramah. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families.
006	JOS	019	009	Out of the portion of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon; for the portion of the children of Judah was too much for them; therefore the children of Simeon obtained their inheritance within their inheritance.
006	JOS	019	010	And then came up the third lot for the children of Zebulun according to their families; and the boundary of their inheritance extended up to Sarid;
006	JOS	019	011	And their boundary went up toward the sea, and Mar'alah, and touched on Dabbesheth, and touched on the brook that is before Yokne'am;
006	JOS	019	012	And turned from Sarid eastward toward the rising of the sun unto the border of Kisloth-tabor, and then went out to Daberath, and went up to Yaphia';
006	JOS	019	013	And from there it passed on in front to the east unto Gath-Chepher, to 'Eth-kazin, and went out to Rimmon, whence it extended to Ne'ah;
006	JOS	019	014	And this boundary turned about on the north side to Channathon; and its terminations were in the valley of Yiph-thach-el;
006	JOS	019	015	And Kattath, and Nahallal, and Shimron, and Yidalah, and Beth-lechem: twelve cities with their villages.
006	JOS	019	016	This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according to their families, these cities with their villages.
006	JOS	019	017	For Issachar came out the fourth lot, for the children of Issachar according to their families.
006	JOS	019	018	And their boundary went to Yizre'el, and Kessulloth, and Shunem,
006	JOS	019	019	And Chapharayim, and Shion, and Anacharath,
006	JOS	019	020	And Rabbith, and Kishyon, and Abez,
006	JOS	019	021	And Remeth, and 'En-gannim, and 'En-chaddah, and Beth-pazazz;
006	JOS	019	022	And the boundary touched on Tabor, and Shachazimah, and Beth-shemesh; and the terminations of their boundaries were at the Jordan: sixteen cities with their villages.
006	JOS	019	023	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar according to their families, the cities and their villages.
006	JOS	019	024	And then came out the fifth lot for the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families.
006	JOS	019	025	And their boundary was Chelkath, and Chali, and Beten, and Achshaph,
006	JOS	019	026	And Allammelech, and 'Am'ad, and Mishal; and it touched on Carmel at the sea, and on Shichor-libnath;
006	JOS	019	027	And it turned toward the rising of the sun to Beth-dagon, and touched on Zebulun, and on the valley of Yiphthach-el at the north, on Beth-ha'emek, and Ne'iel, and went out to Cabul on the left,
006	JOS	019	028	And 'Ebron, and Rechob, and Chammon, and Kanah, up to Zidon the great city,
006	JOS	019	029	And then the boundary turned back to Ramah, and to the city of Mibzar-zor; and then the boundary turned back to Chossah; and the terminations were by the sea in the district toward Achzib;
006	JOS	019	030	And 'Ummah and Aphek, and Rechob: twenty and two cities with their villages.
006	JOS	019	031	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages.
006	JOS	019	032	Unto the children of Naphtali came out the sixth lot, for the children of Naphtali according to their families.
006	JOS	019	033	And their boundary was from Cheleph, from Allon-beza-'anannim, and Adami-hanekeb, and Yabneel, as far as Lakkum; and its terminations were at the Jordan;
006	JOS	019	034	And then the boundary turned westward to Aznoth-tabor, and went out from there to Chukkok, and touched on Zebulun on the south, and touched on Asher on the west, and on Judah upon the Jordan toward the rising of the sun.
006	JOS	019	035	And fortified cities, Ziddim, Zer, and Chammath, Rakkath, and Kinnereth,
006	JOS	019	036	And Adamah, and Ramah, and Chazor,
006	JOS	019	037	And Kedesh, and Edre'i, and 'En-chazor,
006	JOS	019	038	And Yiron, and Migdal-el, Chorem, and Beth-'anath, and Beth-shemesh: nineteen cities with their villages.
006	JOS	019	039	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali according to their families, the cities and their villages.
006	JOS	019	040	For the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families came out of the seventh lot.
006	JOS	019	041	And the boundary of their inheritance was Zor'ah, and Eshtaol, and 'Ir-shemesh,
006	JOS	019	042	And Sha'alabbin, and Ayalon, and Yithlah,
006	JOS	019	043	And Elon, and Thimnathah, and 'Ekron,
006	JOS	019	044	And Eltekeh, and Gibbethon, and Ba'alath,
006	JOS	019	045	And Yehud, and Bene-berak, and Gathrimmon.
006	JOS	019	046	And Me-hayarkon, and Rakkon, with the boundary before Yapho.
006	JOS	019	047	And the territory of the children of Dan went out beyond these; for the children of Dan went up and fought against Leshem, and captured it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and took possession of it, and dwelt therein, and they called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father.
006	JOS	019	048	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages.
006	JOS	019	049	And they made an end of dividing the land for inheritance after its boundaries; and the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun among them;
006	JOS	019	050	By the order of the Lord did they give him the city which he had asked, Timnathserach on the mountain of Ephraim: and he built the city, and dwelt therein.
006	JOS	019	051	These are the inheritances, which Elazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the divisions of the tribes of the children of Israel, divided for an inheritance by lot, at Shiloh before the Lord, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. So they made an end of dividing the country.
006	JOS	020	001	And the Lord spoke unto Joshua, saying,
006	JOS	020	002	speak to the children of Israel, saying, Appoint for yourselves the cities of refuge, whereof I have spoken unto you by the hand of Moses;
006	JOS	020	003	That thither may flee the manslayer that killeth any person unawares, without knowledge; and they shall be unto you for a refuge from the avenger of the blood.
006	JOS	020	004	And he shall flee unto one of those cities, and he shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city, and speak in the ears of the elders of that city his words; and they shall take him into the city unto them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them.
006	JOS	020	005	And if the avenger of the blood should pursue after him, then shall they not deliver the manslayer up into his hand; because without knowledge did he smite his neighbor, and he was not an enemy to him in time past.
006	JOS	020	006	And he shall dwell in that city, until he shall have stood before the congregation for judgment, [and] until the death of the high-priest that may be in those days: then shall the manslayer return, and come unto his own house, unto the city whence he hath fled.
006	JOS	020	007	And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in the mountain of Naphtali, and Shechem in the mountain of Ephraim, and Kiryath-arba', which is Hebron, in the mountain of Judah.
006	JOS	020	008	And on the other side of the Jordan by Jericho eastward, they appointed Bezer in the wilderness in the plain from the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gil'ad from the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan from the tribe of Menasseh.
006	JOS	020	009	These were the cities assigned for all the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them, that thither might flee whosoever killeth any person at unawares, and that he should not die by the hand of the avenger of the blood, until he have stood before the congregation.
006	JOS	021	001	Then came near the heads of the divisions of the Levites unto Elazar the priest, and unto Joshua the son of Nun, and unto the heads of the divisions of the tribes of the children of Israel;
006	JOS	021	002	And they spoke unto them at Shiloh, in the land of Canaan, saying, The Lord commanded by the hand of Moses to give unto us cities to dwell in, with the open spaces thereof for our cattle.
006	JOS	021	003	And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites from their inheritance, at the order of the Lord, these cities and their open spaces.
006	JOS	021	004	And the lot came out for the families of the Kehathites: and the children of Aaron the priest, who were of the Levites, obtained from the tribe of Judah, and from the tribe of Simeon, and from the tribe of Benjamin, by lot, thirteen cities.
006	JOS	021	005	And the rest of the children of Kehath obtained from the families of the tribe of Ephraim, and from the tribe of Dan, and from the half tribe of Menasseh, by lot, ten cities.
006	JOS	021	006	And the children of Gershon obtained from the families of the tribe of Issachar, and from the tribe of Asher, and from the tribe of Naphtali, and from the half tribe of Menasseh in Bashan, by lot, thirteen cities.
006	JOS	021	007	The children of Merari after their families obtained from the tribe of Reuben, and from the tribe of Gad, and from the tribe of Zebulun, twelve cities.
006	JOS	021	008	And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites these cities with their open spaces, as the Lord had commanded by the hand of Moses, by lot.
006	JOS	021	009	And they gave from the tribe of the children of Judah, and from the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are called by name.
006	JOS	021	010	And the children of Aaron, of the families of the Kehathites, of the children of Levi, obtained them; —for they had the first lot.
006	JOS	021	011	And they gave unto them Kiryath-arba', [the father of 'Anak,] which is Hebron, in the mountain of Judah, with the open spaces thereof round about it;
006	JOS	021	012	But the fields of the city, and its villages, they gave to Caleb the son of Yephunneh for his possession.
006	JOS	021	013	And to the children of Aaron the priest they gave the city of refuge for the manslayer, Hebron with its open spaces, and Libnah with its open spaces,
006	JOS	021	014	And Yattir with its open spaces, and Eshtemoa' with its open spaces.
006	JOS	021	015	And Cholon with its open spaces, and Debir with its open spaces,
006	JOS	021	016	And 'Ayin with its open spaces, and Yuttah with its open spaces, and Beth-shemesh with its open spaces: nine cities from those two tribes.
006	JOS	021	017	And from the tribe of Benjamin, Gib'on with its open spaces, Geba' with its open spaces,
006	JOS	021	018	'Anathoth with its open spaces, and 'Almon with its open spaces: four cities.
006	JOS	021	019	All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities with their open spaces.
006	JOS	021	020	And the families of the children of Kehath, the Levites, who remained of the children of Kehath, obtained the cities of their lot from the tribe of Ephraim.
006	JOS	021	021	And they gave to them the city of refuge for the manslayer, Shechem with its open spaces in the mountain of Ephraim, and Gezer with its open spaces,
006	JOS	021	022	And Kibzayim with its open spaces, and Beth-choron with its open spaces: four cities.
006	JOS	021	023	And from the tribe of Dan, Elteke with its open spaces, Gibbethon with its open spaces,
006	JOS	021	024	Ayalon with its open spaces, Gath-rimmon with its open spaces: four cities.
006	JOS	021	025	And from the half tribe of Menasseh, Ta'nach with its open spaces, and Gath-rimmon with its open spaces: two cities.
006	JOS	021	026	All the cities were ten with their open spaces for the families of the children of Kehath that remained.
006	JOS	021	027	And unto the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites, [they gave] from the other half tribe of Menasseh the city of refuge for the manslayer, Golan in Bashan with its open spaces, and Be'eshterah with its open spaces: two cities.
006	JOS	021	028	And from the tribe of Issachar, Kishyon with its open spaces, Daberath with its open spaces,
006	JOS	021	029	Yarmuth with its open spaces, 'En-gannim with its open spaces: four cities.
006	JOS	021	030	And from the tribe of Asher, Mishal with its open spaces, Abdon with its open spaces.
006	JOS	021	031	Chelkath with its open spaces, and Rechob with its open spaces: four cities.
006	JOS	021	032	And from the tribe of Naphtali, the city of refuge for the manslayer, Kedesh in Galilee with its open spaces, and Chammothdor with its open spaces, and Karthan with its open spaces: three cities.
006	JOS	021	033	All the cities of the Gershunites according to their families were thirteen cities with their open spaces.
006	JOS	021	034	And unto the families of the children of Merari, the remainder of the Levites, [they gave] from the tribe of Zebulun, Yokne'am with its open spaces, and Karthah with its open spaces,
006	JOS	021	035	Dimnah with its open spaces, Nahalal with its open spaces: four cities.
006	JOS	021	038	And from the tribe of Gad, the city of refuge for the manslayer, Ramoth in Gil'ad with its open spaces, and Machanayim with its open spaces,
006	JOS	021	039	Cheshbon with its open spaces, Ya'zer with its open spaces: four cities in all.
006	JOS	021	040	All the cities for the children of Merari after their families, they who were remaining of the families of the Levites, even their lot was twelve cities.
006	JOS	021	041	All the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the children of Israel were forty and eight cities with their open spaces.
006	JOS	021	042	These cities were every one with their open spaces round about them: thus it was with all these cities.
006	JOS	021	043	And the Lord gave unto Israel all the land which he had sworn to give unto their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt therein.
006	JOS	021	044	And the Lord gave them rest round about, all just as he had sworn unto their fathers: and there stood not up before them a man of all their enemies; all their enemies the Lord delivered into their hand.
006	JOS	021	045	There failed not aught of all the good thing which the Lord had spoken unto the house of Israel: it all came to pass.
006	JOS	022	001	Then did Joshua call the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Menasseh,
006	JOS	022	002	And he said unto them, Ye have indeed kept all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, and ye have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you:
006	JOS	022	003	Ye have not forsaken your brethren these many days, until this day; but ye have kept the obligation of the commandment of the Lord your God.
006	JOS	022	004	And now the Lord your God hath given rest unto your brethren, as he promised them; therefore now turn yourselves, and get you unto your tents, unto the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave unto you on the other side of the Jordan.
006	JOS	022	005	Only take diligent heed to practise the commandment and the law, which Moses the servant of the Lord hath commanded you, to love the Lord your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.
006	JOS	022	006	And Joshua blessed them, and sent them away; and they went unto their tents.
006	JOS	022	007	Now to the one half of the tribe of Menasseh Moses had given possession in Bashan; but unto the other half thereof gave Joshua with their brethren on this side of the Jordan westward; and when Joshua sent them also away unto their tents, he blessed them;
006	JOS	022	008	And he said unto them, as followeth, With much riches return unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with copper, and with iron, and with very many garments: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.
006	JOS	022	009	And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Menasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel from Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go unto the country of Gil'ad, to the land of their possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the order of the Lord by the hand of Moses.
006	JOS	022	010	And when they came unto the districts of the Jordan, that are in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Menasseh built there an altar by the Jordan, a great altar for a show.
006	JOS	022	011	And the children of Israel heard, as followeth, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Menasseh have built an altar in the front of the land of Canaan, in the districts of the Jordan, at the side belonging to the children of Israel.
006	JOS	022	012	And when the children of Israel heard it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled themselves together at Shiloh, to go up against them to war.
006	JOS	022	013	And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Menasseh, into the land of Gil'ad, Phinehas the son of Elazar the priest.
006	JOS	022	014	And ten princes with him, one prince each for every division of all the tribes of Israel; and each one was a head of their family divisions among the thousands of Israel.
006	JOS	022	015	And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Menasseh, unto the land of Gil'ad, and they spoke with them, saying:
006	JOS	022	016	Thus have said the whole congregation of the Lord, What trespass is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel to turn away this day from following the Lord, in that ye have built yourselves an altar, that ye might rebel this day against the Lord?
006	JOS	022	017	Have we had too little in the iniquity of Peor, —from which we are not yet cleansed until this day, —when there was a plague in the congregation of the Lord?
006	JOS	022	018	And will ye turn away this day from following the Lord? and it will be, that when ye will rebel this day against the Lord, tomorrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel.
006	JOS	022	019	But, notwithstanding, if the land of your possession be unclean, then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the Lord, wherein dwelleth the tabernacle of the Lord, and take possession in the midst of us; but rebel not against the Lord and against us do not rebel, in building yourselves an altar beside the altar of the Lord our God.
006	JOS	022	020	Did not 'Achan the son of Zerach commit a trespass on the devoted things, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and he, though but one man, perished not alone in his iniquity.
006	JOS	022	021	But the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Menasseh answered, and they spoke unto the heads of the thousands of Israel,
006	JOS	022	022	The God of gods, the Eternal, the God of gods, the Eternal, he knoweth, and Israel also shall know: if it be in rebellion, or if in transgression against the Lord, [aid us not this day,]
006	JOS	022	023	That we have built us an altar to turn away from following the Lord; or if to offer thereon burnt-offering or meat-offering, or if to offer thereon peace-offerings, may the Lord himself require it;
006	JOS	022	024	Or whether we have not done it for fear of this thing, saying, In time to come your children might say unto our children, as followeth, What have ye to do with the Lord, the God of Israel?
006	JOS	022	025	For the Lord hath made a boundary between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children of Gad, —the Jordan; ye have no part in the Lord: thus might your children make our children cease so as not to fear the Lord.
006	JOS	022	026	Wherefore we said, Let us now act for ourselves to build this altar, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice;
006	JOS	022	027	But it shall be a witness between us, and you, and our generations after us, that we may perform the service of the Lord before him with our burnt-offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our, peace-offerings; and that your children may not say in time to come to our children, Ye have no portion in the Lord.
006	JOS	022	028	And we said, that it shall be! when they should say this to us and to our generations in time to come, that we may say, Behold the pattern of the altar of the Lord, which our fathers made, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice; but it is a witness between us and you.
006	JOS	022	029	Far be it from us that we should rebel against the Lord, and turn away this day from following the Lord, to build an altar for burnt-offering, for meat-offering, or for sacrifice, beside the altar of the Lord our God that is before his dwelling.
006	JOS	022	030	And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation and the heads of the thousands of Israel who were with him, heard the words which the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Menasseh had spoken, it was pleasing in their eyes.
006	JOS	022	031	And Phinehas the son of Elazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Menasseh, This day do we know that the Lord is in our midst, because ye have not committed this trespass against the Lord: now have ye delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the Lord.
006	JOS	022	032	And Phinehas the son of Elazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gil'ad, unto the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and they brought them word again.
006	JOS	022	033	And the thing was pleasing in the eyes of the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God; and they did not speak any more to go up against them to battle, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt.
006	JOS	022	034	And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar [“'Ed”]; for [they said] it is a witness between us that the Eternal is God.
006	JOS	023	001	And it came to pass after many days, after the Lord had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, and Joshua had grown old and was well stricken in age,
006	JOS	023	002	That Joshua called for all Israel, for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said unto them, I am become old and well stricken in age;
006	JOS	023	003	And ye have yourselves seen all that the Lord your God hath done unto all these nations, because of you; for the Lord your God it is that hath fought for you.
006	JOS	023	004	Behold, I have divided unto you by lot those nations that yet remain, to be an inheritance according to your tribes, from the Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, as far as the great sea, toward the setting of the sun.
006	JOS	023	005	And the Lord your God will indeed expel them from before you, and drive them out from before you; and ye shall possess their land, as the Lord your God hath spoken unto you.
006	JOS	023	006	But be ye very steadfast to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, so as not to turn aside therefrom to the right or to the left;
006	JOS	023	007	So as not to come among these nations, those that are left remaining near you; and of the name of their gods shall ye not make mention, nor cause any to swear thereby, neither shall ye serve them, nor bow yourselves down unto them;
006	JOS	023	008	But unto the Lord your God shall ye cleave, as ye have done unto this day.
006	JOS	023	009	And the Lord drove out from before you great and mighty nations; but as for you, no man hath been able to stand up before you unto this day.
006	JOS	023	010	One man of you can chase a thousand; for the Lord your God it is that fighteth for you, as he hath spoken unto you.
006	JOS	023	011	Take good heed therefore for your souls' sake, to love the Lord your God.
006	JOS	023	012	For if ye do in any wise turn back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, those that are left remaining near you, and make marriages with them, and come in among them, and they among you:
006	JOS	023	013	Know for a certainty that the Lord your God will no more drive out these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and stings in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which the Lord your God hath given you.
006	JOS	023	014	And, behold, I am going this day the way of all the earth; and ye know with all your heart and with all your soul, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the Lord your God spoke concerning you: all are come to pass unto you, not one thing thereof hath failed.
006	JOS	023	015	But it shall come to pass, that as every good thing is come upon you, which the Lord your God spoke unto you: so will the Lord bring upon you every evil thing, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which the Lord your God hath given unto you.
006	JOS	023	016	When ye transgress the covenant of the Lord your God, which he hath commanded you, and go and serve other gods, and bow yourselves down to them: then will the anger of the Lord be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you.
006	JOS	024	001	And Joshua assembled all the tribes of Israel to Shechem; and he called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and they presented themselves before God.
006	JOS	024	002	And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus hath said the Lord the God of Israel, On the other side of the river did your fathers dwell in old time, even Terach, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor; and they served other gods.
006	JOS	024	003	And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the river, and I led him throughout all the land of Canaan; and I multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.
006	JOS	024	004	And I gave unto Isaac, Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.
006	JOS	024	005	And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt in the manner as I have done among them; and after that I brought you out.
006	JOS	024	006	And I brought your fathers out of Egypt; and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red Sea.
006	JOS	024	007	And they cried unto the Lord, and he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and he brought the sea over them, and covered them; and your eyes saw what I had done on Egypt; and ye dwelt in the wilderness many days.
006	JOS	024	008	And I brought you into the land of the Emorites, that dwelt on the other side of the Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave them into your hand, and ye took possession of their land; and I destroyed them from before you.
006	JOS	024	009	Then Balak the son of Zippor, the king of Moab, arose and warred against Israel; and he sent and called Bil'am the son of Beor to curse you;
006	JOS	024	010	And I would not hearken unto Bil'am; but he had to bless you instead: and I delivered you out of his hand.
006	JOS	024	011	And ye passed over the Jordan, and came unto Jericho; and then fought the men of Jericho against you, the Emorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I gave them up into your hand.
006	JOS	024	012	And I sent before you the hornet which drove them out from before you, even the two kings of the Emorites: not with thy sword, and not with thy bow.
006	JOS	024	013	And I gave you a land for which ye had not toiled, and cities which ye had not built, and ye dwell in them; of vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.
006	JOS	024	014	Now therefore fear the Lord, and serve him in sincerity and truth; and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the river and in Egypt, and serve the Lord.
006	JOS	024	015	And if it be displeasing in your eyes to serve the Lord, choose for yourselves this day whom ye will serve: whether the gods which your fathers that were on the other side of the river served, or the gods of the Emorites, in whose land ye dwell; but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.
006	JOS	024	016	And the people answered and said, Far be it from us to forsake the Lord, to serve other gods;
006	JOS	024	017	For the Lord our God it is that hath brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery, and who hath done those great signs before our eyes, and preserved us upon all the way whereon we have gone, and among all the people through the midst of whom we have passed:
006	JOS	024	018	And the Lord hath driven out all the nations, and the Emorites who dwelt in the land, from before us; therefore also will we serve the Lord; for he is our God.
006	JOS	024	019	And Joshua said unto the people, Ye will not be able to serve the Lord; for he is a holy God; he is a watchful God; he will not have any indulgence for your transgressions and for your sins;
006	JOS	024	020	If ye forsake the Lord, and serve strange gods, then will he again do ye evil, and consume ye, after that he hath done you good.
006	JOS	024	021	And the people said unto Joshua, No; nevertheless the Lord will we serve.
006	JOS	024	022	And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye yourselves have chosen for you the Lord, to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses.
006	JOS	024	023	And now put away the strange gods which are in the midst of you, and incline your heart unto the Lord the God of Israel.
006	JOS	024	024	And the people said unto Joshua, The Lord our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey.
006	JOS	024	025	And Joshua made a covenant with the people on that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.
006	JOS	024	026	And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God; and he took a great stone, and set it up there under the oak, that was by the sanctuary of the Lord.
006	JOS	024	027	And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be among us as a witness; for it hath heard all the words of the Lord which he spoke unto us: it shall be therefore as a witness against you, that ye may not deny your God.
006	JOS	024	028	And Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance.
006	JOS	024	029	And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died, one hundred and ten years old.
006	JOS	024	030	And they buried him on the border of his inheritance at Timnath-serach, which is on the mountain of Ephraim, on the north side of mount Ga'ash.
006	JOS	024	031	And Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who lived many days after Joshua, and who had known all the deeds of the Lord, that he had done for Israel.
006	JOS	024	032	And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel had brought up out of Egypt, they buried in Shechem, in a parcel of the field which Jacob had bought of the sons of Chamor the father of Shechem for one hundred kessitah: and it remained the inheritance of the children of Joseph.
006	JOS	024	033	And Elazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him on the hill of Phinehas his son, which was given him in the mountain of Ephraim.

# BOOK	007	JDG	Judges	Judges
007	JDG	001	001	And it came to pass after the death of Joshua, that the children of Israel asked the Lord, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites at the first, to fight against them?
007	JDG	001	002	And the Lord said, Judah shall go up; behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.
007	JDG	001	003	And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, and we will fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.
007	JDG	001	004	And Judah went up; and the Lord delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand; and they smote [of] them in Bezek ten thousand men.
007	JDG	001	005	And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek; and they fought against him, and they smote the Canaanites and the Perizzites.
007	JDG	001	006	But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.
007	JDG	001	007	And Adoni-bezek said, Seventy kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered food under my table: as I have done, so hath God requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.
007	JDG	001	008	And the children of Judah fought against Jerusalem, and captured it, and they smote it with the edge of the sword, and the city they set on fire.
007	JDG	001	009	And afterward did the children of Judah go down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the lowlands.
007	JDG	001	010	And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron; [now the name of Hebron was formerly Kiryath-arba';] and they smote Sheshai, and Achiman, and Talmai.
007	JDG	001	011	And he went from there against the inhabitants of Debir; and the name of Debir was formerly Kiryath-sepher:
007	JDG	001	012	And Caleb said, He that will smite Kiryath-sepher, and capture it, to him will I give 'Achsah my daughter for wife.
007	JDG	001	013	And 'Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, captured it: and he gave him 'Achsah his daughter for wife.
007	JDG	001	014	And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she persuaded him to ask of her father a field: and she alighted from off her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What aileth thee?
007	JDG	001	015	And she said unto him, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a dry land: give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.
007	JDG	001	016	And the children of the Kenite, the father-in-law of Moses, went up out of the city of palm-trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which is at the south of 'Arad; and they went and dwelt with the people.
007	JDG	001	017	And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they smote the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and devoted it. And the name of the city was called Chormah.
007	JDG	001	018	And Judah captured Gazzah with its territory, and Ashkelon with its territory, and 'Ekron with its territory.
007	JDG	001	019	And the Lord was with Judah; and he took possession of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.
007	JDG	001	020	And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses had spoken; and he drove out thence the three sons of 'Anak.
007	JDG	001	021	And the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem, the children of Benjamin did not drive out; but the Jebusites dwelt with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem until this day.
007	JDG	001	022	And the house of Joseph, these also, went up against Beth-el; and the Lord was with them.
007	JDG	001	023	And the house of Joseph sent to spy out Beth-el: now the name of the city formerly was Luz.
007	JDG	001	024	And the watchers saw a man coming forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Show us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will show thee kindness.
007	JDG	001	025	And he showed them the entrance into the city, and they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but the man and all his family they let go free.
007	JDG	001	026	And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called its name Luz: this is its name unto this day.
007	JDG	001	027	Neither did Menasseh drive out [the inhabitants of] Beth-shean and its towns, nor Ta'anach and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Yible'am and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; but the Canaanites succeeded to remain in this land.
007	JDG	001	028	And it came to pass, when Israel became strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute; but they did not drive them out entirely.
007	JDG	001	029	Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; and the Canaanites dwelt in the midst of them at Gezer.
007	JDG	001	030	Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; and the Canaanites dwelt in the midst of them, and became tributary.
007	JDG	001	031	Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of 'Akko, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Achlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Chelbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rechob;
007	JDG	001	032	And the Asherites dwelt in the midst of the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out.
007	JDG	001	033	Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-'anath; and he dwelt in the midst of the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became tributary unto them.
007	JDG	001	034	And the Emorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain; for they would not suffer them to come down into the valley;
007	JDG	001	035	And the Emorites succeeded to remain on mount Cheres, in Ayalon, and in Sha'albim; but when the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, they became tributary.
007	JDG	001	036	And the territory of the Emorites was from the ascent of 'Akrabbim, from the Rock upward.
007	JDG	002	001	And a messenger of the Lord came up from Gilgal to Bochim, And he said, I caused you to go up out of Egypt, and I brought you unto the land which I had sworn unto your fathers; and I said, I will not break my covenant with you for ever.
007	JDG	002	002	But ye for your part shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; their altars shall ye throw down; but ye have not obeyed my voice: what is this ye have done?
007	JDG	002	003	And I also have said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be evil neighbors to you, and their gods shall become a snare unto you.
007	JDG	002	004	And it came to pass, when the messenger of the Lord spoke these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.
007	JDG	002	005	And they called the name of that place, Bochim; and they sacrificed there unto the Lord.
007	JDG	002	006	And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to take possession of the land.
007	JDG	002	007	And the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that lived many days after Joshua, who had seen all the great deeds of the Lord, which he had done for Israel.
007	JDG	002	008	Then died Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, being one hundred and ten years old.
007	JDG	002	009	And they buried him on the border of his inheritance in Timnath-cheres, in the mountain of Ephraim, on the north side of mount Ga'ash.
007	JDG	002	010	And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers; and there arose another generation after them, who knew not the Lord, and likewise not the deeds which he had done for Israel.
007	JDG	002	011	And the children of Israel did the evil in the eyes of the Lord, and served the Be'alim:
007	JDG	002	012	And they forsook the Lord the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt, and they went after other gods, of the gods of the nations that were round about them, and they bowed themselves unto them, and incensed the Lord.
007	JDG	002	013	And they forsook the Lord, and served Baal and 'Ashtaroth.
007	JDG	002	014	And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of spoilers who spoiled them, and he sold them into the hand of their enemies round about, and they were not able any longer to stand before their enemies.
007	JDG	002	015	Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the Lord was against them for evil, as the Lord had spoken, and as the Lord had sworn unto them: and they were greatly distressed.
007	JDG	002	016	And the Lord raised up judges, and they delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.
007	JDG	002	017	But also unto their judges they did not hearken; but they went astray after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers had walked in, to obey the commandments of the Lord; they did not so.
007	JDG	002	018	And when the Lord raised them up judges, then was the Lord with the judge, and he delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for the Lord bethought himself because of their groaning by reason of those that oppressed them and ill-treated them.
007	JDG	002	019	And it came to pass, when the judge died, that they returned, and became more corrupt than their fathers, in going after other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them: they omitted nothing from their doings, and from their stubborn way.
007	JDG	002	020	And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel; and he said, For the cause that this people have transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice:
007	JDG	002	021	So will I also for my part not drive out henceforth any man from before them out of the nations which Joshua left when he died;
007	JDG	002	022	In order to prove through them the Israelites, whether they will keep the way of the Lord, to walk therein, as their fathers did keep it, or not.
007	JDG	002	023	And thus did the Lord leave these nations, so as not to drive them out speedily; and he delivered them not into the hand of Joshua.
007	JDG	003	001	Now these are the nations that the Lord left, to prove by them the Israelites, namely, all those who had not experienced all the wars of Canaan;
007	JDG	003	002	Only in order that the future generations of the children of Israel might obtain knowledge, to teach them war; but only such as before had learned nothing thereof;
007	JDG	003	003	Namely, the five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Zidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt on mount Lebanon, from mount Ba'al-chermon unto the entrance of Chamath.
007	JDG	003	004	And they were left to prove by them the Israelites, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the Lord, which he had commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.
007	JDG	003	005	And the children of Israel dwelt in the midst of the Canaanites, the Hittites, and the Emorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites;
007	JDG	003	006	And they took their daughters to themselves for wives, and their daughters they gave to their sons; and they served their gods.
007	JDG	003	007	And the children of Israel did [thus] the evil in the eyes of the Lord, and forgot the Lord their God, and served the Be'alim and the groves.
007	JDG	003	008	Wherefore the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan-rish'athayim the king of Mesopotamia; and the children of Israel served Cushan-rish'athayim eight years.
007	JDG	003	009	And the children of Israel cried then unto the Lord, and the Lord raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, namely, 'Othniel the son of Kenaz, the younger brother of Caleb.
007	JDG	003	010	And the spirit of the Lord came over him, and he judged Israel, and went out to battle: and the Lord delivered Cushan-rish'athayim the king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed over Cushan-rish'athayim.
007	JDG	003	011	And the land had rest forty years; and then died 'Othniel the son of Kenaz.
007	JDG	003	012	And the children of Israel did again the evil in the eyes of the Lord; and the Lord strengthened 'Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done the evil in the eyes of the Lord.
007	JDG	003	013	And he gathered unto him the children of 'Ammon and 'Amalek, and they went and smote Israel, and took possession of the city of palm-trees.
007	JDG	003	014	And the children of Israel served 'Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
007	JDG	003	015	But the children of Israel cried then unto the Lord; and the Lord raised up unto them a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera a Benjamite, a man who was lamed in his right hand; and the children of Israel sent by him a present unto 'Eglon the king of Moab.
007	JDG	003	016	But Ehud made himself a sword which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he girded it under his garments upon his right thigh.
007	JDG	003	017	And he brought the present near unto 'Eglon the king of Moab; now 'Eglon was a very fat man.
007	JDG	003	018	And it came to pass when he had made an end to offer the present, that he sent away the people who had borne the present.
007	JDG	003	019	But he himself returned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret word unto thee, O King. And he said, Keep silence. And thereupon went out from his presence all that stood by him.
007	JDG	003	020	And Ehud came in unto him; and he was sitting in the summer upper chamber, which was for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a word of God unto thee. And he arose out of his chair.
007	JDG	003	021	And Ehud stretched forth his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his body.
007	JDG	003	022	And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade; for he did not draw the sword out of his body, and it passed into the fundament.
007	JDG	003	023	And Ehud went forth into the ante-room, and shut the doors of the upper chamber after him, and locked them.
007	JDG	003	024	He was just gone out, when his servants came; and they saw, behold, the doors of the upper chamber were locked; and they said, Surely he covereth his feet in the summer chamber.
007	JDG	003	025	And they tarried till they were ashamed; and behold, he opened not the doors of the upper chamber; wherefore they took the key and opened them: and, behold, their lord was lying dead on the floor.
007	JDG	003	026	And Ehud had escaped while they were tarrying, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Se'irah.
007	JDG	003	027	And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew the cornet on the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mountain, and he before them.
007	JDG	003	028	And he said unto them, Pursue after me; for the Lord hath delivered your enemies, the Moabites, into your hand. And they went down after him, and seized on the fords of the Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.
007	JDG	003	029	And they smote of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valor; and there escaped not a man.
007	JDG	003	030	And Moab was humbled that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest eighty years.
007	JDG	003	031	And after him was Shamgar the son of 'Anath, who smote of the philistines six hundred men with an ox-goad; and he also delivered Israel.
007	JDG	004	001	And the children of Israel again did the evil in the eyes of the Lord, when Ehud was dead.
007	JDG	004	002	And the Lord sold them into the hand of Yabin the king of Canaan, that reigned in Chazor; and the captain of his army was Sissera, who dwelt in Charosheth-hagoyim.
007	JDG	004	003	And the children of Israel cried unto the Lord; for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and he oppressed the children of Israel with might twenty years.
007	JDG	004	004	And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, —she judged Israel at that time.
007	JDG	004	005	And she held her sitting under the palm-tree of Deborah between Ramah and Beth-el on the mountain of Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.
007	JDG	004	006	And she sent and called Barak the son of Abino'am out of Kedesh-naphtali; and she said unto him, Behold, the Lord the God of Israel hath commanded, Go and lead on toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun.
007	JDG	004	007	And I will draw unto thee, to the brook Kishon, Sissera, the captain of Yabin's army, and his chariots and his multitude; and I will give him up into thy hand.
007	JDG	004	008	And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then will I go; but if thou wilt not go with me, I will not go.
007	JDG	004	009	And she said, I will indeed go with thee; nevertheless it will not be for thy honor, on the way which thou goest; for into the hand of a woman will the Lord deliver Sissera; and Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.
007	JDG	004	010	And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh; and there went up in his train ten thousand men; also Deborah went up with him.
007	JDG	004	011	Now Cheber the Kenite had severed himself from the Kenites, from the children of Chobab the father-in-law of Moses; and he had pitched his tent as far as Elon-beza'anannim, which is near Kedesh.
007	JDG	004	012	And they told Sissera that Barak the son of Abino'am was gone up to mount Tabor.
007	JDG	004	013	And Sissera called together all his chariots, nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Charosheth-hagoyim unto the brook Kishon.
007	JDG	004	014	And Deborah said unto Barak, Up! for this is the day on which the Lord hath given Sissera into thy hand; behold, the Lord is gone out before thee: so Barak went down from mount Tabor, with ten thousand men after him.
007	JDG	004	015	And the Lord confounded Sissera, and all his chariots, and all his army, with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sissera alighted from his chariot, and fled away on foot.
007	JDG	004	016	And Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the army, unto Charosheth-hagoyim: and all the army of Sissera fell by the edge of the sword; there was not left even one.
007	JDG	004	017	But Sissera had fled away on foot to the tent of Ja'el the wife of Cheber the Kenite; for there was peace between Yabin the king of Chazor and the house of Cheber the Kenite.
007	JDG	004	018	And Ja'el went out to meet Sissera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in unto me, fear not: and he turned in unto her into the tent, and she covered him with a blanket.
007	JDG	004	019	And he said unto her, Give me to drink, I pray thee, a little water; for I am thirsty: and she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him to drink, and covered him up.
007	JDG	004	020	And he said unto her, Stand at the door of the tent; and it shall be, that, when any man should come and ask of thee, and say, Is there any man here? thou shalt say, No.
007	JDG	004	021	And Ja'el the wife of Cheber took thereupon the nail of the tent, and placed a hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and struck the nail into his temple, and it became fastened in the ground; but he was fast asleep and weary; so he died.
007	JDG	004	022	And, behold, Barak came in pursuit of Sissera, and Ja'el came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will show thee the man whom thou art seeking: and he came to her, and behold, Sissera was lying dead, with the nail in his temple.
007	JDG	004	023	So did God humble on that day Yabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.
007	JDG	004	024	And the hand of the children of Israel became constantly heavier upon Yabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Yabin the king of Canaan.
007	JDG	005	001	Then sang Deborah with Barak the son of Abino'am on that day, saying,
007	JDG	005	002	When depravity had broken out in Israel, then did the people offer themselves willingly; [therefore] praise ye the Lord.
007	JDG	005	003	Hear, O kings; give ear, O princes; I—unto the Lord will I sing; I will sing praise to the Lord, the God of Israel.
007	JDG	005	004	Lord, at thy going forth out of Seir, at thy marching along out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, also the heavens dropped, also the clouds dropped water.
007	JDG	005	005	The mountains melted away because of the presence of the Lord, yonder Sinai, because of the presence of the Lord, the God of Israel.
007	JDG	005	006	In the days of Shamgar the son of 'Anath, in the days of Ja'el, the highways were unoccupied, and those who travelled on roads walked through crooked by-paths.
007	JDG	005	007	Desolate were the open towns in Israel, they were desolate, until that I arose, Deborah, that I arose a mother in Israel.
007	JDG	005	008	They chose new gods, then was there war in the gates: was there a shield seen or a spear among forty thousand in Israel?
007	JDG	005	009	My heart [belongeth] to the governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the people: praise ye the Lord.
007	JDG	005	010	Ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and ye who walk on the way, utter praise!
007	JDG	005	011	[Urged on] by the voice of those who divide [the flocks] between the watering wells, there shall they rehearse the benefits of the Lord, the benefits toward his open towns in Israel; [for] now go down [again] to the gates the people of the Lord.
007	JDG	005	012	Awake, awake, Deborah! awake, awake, utter a song! up, Barak, and lead away thy captives, son of Abino'am.
007	JDG	005	013	Then obtained dominion a few that had escaped for the nobles among the people—the Lord gave me dominion over the mighty.
007	JDG	005	014	They whose root is out of Ephraim were against 'Amalek; after thee, Benjamin, with thy armies; out of Machir came down lawgivers, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.
007	JDG	005	015	And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; yea Issachar, the support of Barak; into the valley he hastened down in his train; [but] at the streams of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart.
007	JDG	005	016	Why didst thou sit among the sheepfolds to hear the bleatings of the flocks? At the streams of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.
007	JDG	005	017	Gil'ad abode beyond the Jordan; and Dan—why would he tarry in ships? Asher remained on the seashore, and abode near his bays.
007	JDG	005	018	Zebulun is a people that jeoparded its life unto death, and Naphtali—on the high places of the [battle] field.
007	JDG	005	019	There came kings, [and] fought, then fought the kings of Canaan, in Ta'anach by the waters of Megiddo: gain of money they took not away.
007	JDG	005	020	From heaven they fought—the stars in their courses fought against Sissera.
007	JDG	005	021	The stream of Kishon swept them away, that ancient stream, the stream of Kishon: step along, O my soul, in victorious strength.
007	JDG	005	022	Then were crushed the hoofs of the horses, through the prancings, the prancings of their mighty ones.
007	JDG	005	023	Curse ye Meroz, saith the messenger of the Lord, yea, curse ye bitterly its inhabitants; because they came not to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord among the mighty.
007	JDG	005	024	Blessed above [other] women shall be Ja'el the wife of Cheber the Kenite, above [other] women [dwelling] in the tent may she be blessed.
007	JDG	005	025	Water he asked, milk she gave [him]: in a lordly dish she brought him cream.
007	JDG	005	026	Her hand she put forth to the nail, and her right hand to the laborious workmen's hammer; and she hammered Sissera, she struck his head, and crushed and smote through his temple.
007	JDG	005	027	Between her feet he bent, he fell, he lay; between her feet he bent, he fell: where he had bent, there he fell down, bereft of life.
007	JDG	005	028	Out of the window looked and moaned the mother of Sissera, through the lattice, Why tarrieth his chariot so long in coming? why lag the wheels of his chariot?
007	JDG	005	029	The wise among her ladies answered her, she also returned a reply to herself.
007	JDG	005	030	Will they not find, —divide booty? one maiden, two maidens for every man, a booty of colored garments for Sissera, a booty of colored embroidered garments, colored, double-worked garments round the necks of the captives!
007	JDG	005	031	Thus may perish all thy enemies, O Lord; but may those that love him be as the rising of the sun in his might. And the land had rest forty years.
007	JDG	006	001	And the children of Israel did the evil in the eyes of the Lord: and the Lord delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.
007	JDG	006	002	And the hand of Midian prevailed over Israel; and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made for themselves the passes which are in the mountains, and the caves, and the strongholds.
007	JDG	006	003	And it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the 'Amalekites, and the children of the east, and they went up against them;
007	JDG	006	004	And they encamped against them, and destroyed the products of the earth, as far as Gazzah, and they left no sustenance for Israel, neither lamb, nor ox, nor ass.
007	JDG	006	005	For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and came as locusts in multitude; and both they and their camels were without number; and they came into the land to destroy it.
007	JDG	006	006	And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the children of Israel cried unto the Lord.
007	JDG	006	007	And it came to pass, when the children of Israel had cried unto the Lord because of the Midianites,
007	JDG	006	008	That the Lord sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, and he said unto them, Thus hath said the Lord the God of Israel, I led you forth out of Egypt, and brought you out of the house of slavery;
007	JDG	006	009	And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and I drove them out from before you, and gave you their land;
007	JDG	006	010	And I said unto you, I am the Lord your God: ye shall not fear the gods of the Emorites, in whose land ye dwell; but ye have not obeyed my voice.
007	JDG	006	011	And there came an angel of the Lord, and sat down under the oak which was in 'Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abi'ezrite; and Gid'on his son was beating out wheat in the wine-press, to hide it from the Midianites.
007	JDG	006	012	And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him, and said unto him, The Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of valor.
007	JDG	006	013	And Gid'on said unto him, Pardon, my lord, if the Lord be indeed with us, why then hath all this befallen us? and where are all his wonders of which our fathers have told us, saying, Did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt! But now the Lord hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hand of Midian.
007	JDG	006	014	And the Lord turned toward him, and said, Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: behold, I have sent thee.
007	JDG	006	015	And he said unto him, Pardon my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my family is the weakest in Menasseh, and I am the youngest of my father's house.
007	JDG	006	016	And the Lord said unto him, Because I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.
007	JDG	006	017	And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy eyes, then give me a sign that thou hast been speaking with me;
007	JDG	006	018	Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present, and set it before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thy return.
007	JDG	006	019	And Gid'on went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and the broth he put in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it.
007	JDG	006	020	And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and the broth pour out. And he did so.
007	JDG	006	021	Then the angel of the Lord put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. And the angel of the Lord departed out of his sight.
007	JDG	006	022	And when Gid'on perceived that it was an angel of the Lord, Gid'on said, Alas, O Lord Eternal! because I have surely seen an angel of the Lord face to face.
007	JDG	006	023	And the Lord said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou shalt not die.
007	JDG	006	024	And Gid'on built there an altar unto the Lord, and called it Adonay-shalom [the Eternal of Peace:] unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abi'ezrites.
007	JDG	006	025	And it came to pass in the same night, that the Lord said unto him, Take thy father's young bullock, and the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal which belongeth to thy father, and the grove that is around it shalt thou cut down.
007	JDG	006	026	And build an altar unto the Lord thy God upon the top of this rock, on the level place, and take the second bullock, and offer [it as] a burnt-sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down.
007	JDG	006	027	And Gid'on took ten men of his servants, and did as the Lord had spoken unto him; but it came to pass, because he feared his father's household, and the men of the city, to do it by day, that he did it by night.
007	JDG	006	028	And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was overthrown, and the grove that was around it was cut down, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar which had been built.
007	JDG	006	029	And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And they inquired and searched, and then said, Gid'on the son of Joash hath done this thing.
007	JDG	006	030	Thereupon said the men of the city unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die; because he hath overthrown the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the grove that was around it.
007	JDG	006	031	But Joash said unto all that stood around him, Will ye indeed contend for Baal? will ye assist him? he that will contend for him, shall be put to death; [wait] until morning: if he be a god, let him contend for himself, because one hath overthrown his altar.
007	JDG	006	032	And the people called him on that day Yerubba'al, saying, Let Baal contend against him, because he hath overthrown his altar.
007	JDG	006	033	And all the Midianites and 'Amalekites and the children of the east assembled together, and went over and encamped in the valley of Yizre'el.
007	JDG	006	034	But the Spirit of the Lord endued Gid'on, and he blew the cornet: and Abi'ezer assembled and followed him.
007	JDG	006	035	And he sent messengers throughout all Menasseh, who also assembled and followed him; and he sent messengers through Asher, and through Zebulun, and through Naphtali, and they came up to meet them.
007	JDG	006	036	And Gid'on said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast spoken,
007	JDG	006	037	Behold, I set up this fleece of wool in the threshing floor: if now there be dew on the fleece alone, and it be dry upon all the ground, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast spoken.
007	JDG	006	038	And it was so; and when he rose up early on the morrow, he squeezed the fleece together, and wrung dew out of the fleece, [making] a bowl full of water.
007	JDG	006	039	And Gid'on said unto God, Let not thy anger be kindled against me, and I will speak but this once [more]; let me have a proof, I pray thee, but this once more with the fleece; let it, I pray, be dry upon the fleece alone, and upon all the ground let there be dew.
007	JDG	006	040	And God did so that night; and it was dry upon the fleece alone, and on all the ground there was dew.
007	JDG	007	001	Then Yerubba'al, who is Gid'on, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and encamped beside the spring of Charod; and the camp of the Midianites was on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.
007	JDG	007	002	And the Lord said unto Gid'on, The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand: lest Israel should vaunt themselves against me, saying, my own hand hath saved me.
007	JDG	007	003	Now therefore, do proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gil'ad. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and ten thousand remained.
007	JDG	007	004	And the Lord said unto Gid'on, The people are yet too many; let them go down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, that of whom I will say unto thee, This one shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee: and of whomsoever I will say unto thee, This one shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.
007	JDG	007	005	So he caused the people to go down unto the water: and the Lord said unto Gid'on, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as the dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that bendeth down upon his knees to drink.
007	JDG	007	006	And the number of those that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men; but all the rest of the people bent down upon their knees to drink water.
007	JDG	007	007	And the Lord said unto Gid'on, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thy hand; and let all the other people go every man unto his place.
007	JDG	007	008	And they took the provision of the people in their hand, and their cornets; and all the rest of Israel he dismissed, every man unto his tent; but those three hundred men he retained: and the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley.
007	JDG	007	009	And it came to pass, during the same night, that the Lord said unto him, Arise, get thee down into the camp; for I have delivered it into thy hand.
007	JDG	007	010	And if thou fear to go down, then go thou down with Purah thy servant to the camp.
007	JDG	007	011	And thou shalt hear what they will say; and after that shall thy hands be strengthened, and thou wilt go down unto the camp. And he went down with Purah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the camp.
007	JDG	007	012	And the Midianites and the 'Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like the locusts for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand which is by the seaside for multitude.
007	JDG	007	013	And when Gid'on was come, behold, a man was telling a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream, and, lo, a baked cake of barley bread was rolling round through the camp of Midian, and came unto the tent, and struck against it so that it fell, and it turned it bottom upward, and the tent thus tumbled down.
007	JDG	007	014	And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gid'on the son of Joash, a man of Israel; into whose hand God hath delivered Midian, and the whole camp.
007	JDG	007	015	And it was, when Gid'on heard the narration of the dream, and its interpretation, that he prostrated himself, and returned unto the camp of Israel, and said, Arise; for the Lord hath delivered into your hand the camp of Midian.
007	JDG	007	016	And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put cornets in the hand of all of them, with empty pitchers, and torches in the pitchers.
007	JDG	007	017	And he said unto them, What you see me do, do ye likewise; and, behold, when I am come to the edge of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do.
007	JDG	007	018	When I blow the cornet, I and all that are with me, then shall ye blow the cornets also on every side of all the camp, and say, For the Lord, and for Gid'on.
007	JDG	007	019	And Gid'on, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the edge of the camp in the bcginning of the middle watch; when they had but newly set the sentinels: and they blew the cornets, and broke the pitchers that were in their hand.
007	JDG	007	020	And the three companies blew the cornets, and broke the pitchers, and seized with their left hand the torches, and with their right hand the cornets to blow; and they cried, The sword for the Lord, and for Gid'on.
007	JDG	007	021	And they remained standing every man in his place round about the camp; and all [in] the camp ran, and shouted, and fled.
007	JDG	007	022	And as the three hundred cornets sounded, the Lord set every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the camp; and [those in] the camp fled as far as Beth-hashittah to Zererah, up to the border of Abelmecholah, near Tabbath.
007	JDG	007	023	And the men of Israel were called together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Menasseh, and they pursued after the Midianites.
007	JDG	007	024	And Gid'on sent messengers throughout all the mountain of Ephraim, saying, Come down against the Midianites, and seize from them the waters as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan. And all the men of Ephraim assembled themselves, and seized on the waters as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan.
007	JDG	007	025	And they captured two princes of the Midianites, 'Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew 'Oreb upon the rock 'Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued the Midianites; and the heads of 'Oreb and Zeeb they brought to Gid'on from the other side of the Jordan.
007	JDG	008	001	And the men of Ephraim said unto him, What is this thing that thou hast done unto us, not to call for us, when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites? And they quarrelled with him vehemently.
007	JDG	008	002	And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abi'ezer?
007	JDG	008	003	Into your hand God delivered the princes of Midian, 'Oreb and Zeeb: and what have I been able to do in comparison with you? Then was their anger abated from him, when he had spoken this speech.
007	JDG	008	004	And Gid'on came to the Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, and in pursuit.
007	JDG	008	005	And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, a few loaves of bread unto the people that are in my train; for they are faint, and I am pursuing after Zebach and Zalmunna,' the kings of Midian.
007	JDG	008	006	And the princes of Succoth said, Is the sole of the foot of Zebach and Zalmunna' now already in thy hand, that we should give unto thy army bread?
007	JDG	008	007	And Gid'on said, Therefore when the Lord hath delivered Zebach and Zalmunna' into my hand, then will I thresh your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.
007	JDG	008	008	And he went up thence to Penuel, and spoke unto them in the same manner: and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered.
007	JDG	008	009	And he said also unto the men of Penuel thus, When I return again in peace, I will break down this tower.
007	JDG	008	010	Now Zebach and Zalmunna' were in Karkor, and their camps with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that had been left of all the camp of the children of the east; but those who had fallen were one hundred and twenty thousand men that drew the sword.
007	JDG	008	011	And Gid'on went up by the way of those that dwelt in tents, to the east of Nobach and Yogbehah, and smote the camp; but the camp thought itself secure.
007	JDG	008	012	And Zebach and Zalmunna' fled; but he pursued after them, and captured the two kings of Midian, Zebach and Zalmunna', and all the camp he discomfited.
007	JDG	008	013	And Gid'on the son of Joash returned from the battle before the rising of the sun,
007	JDG	008	014	And he caught a young man of the people of Succoth, and inquired of him: and he wrote down for him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof, seventy and seven men.
007	JDG	008	015	And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold here are Zebach and Zalmunna', with whom ye derided me, saying, Is the sole of the foot of Zebach and Zalmunna' now already in thy hand, that we should give unto thy weary men bread?
007	JDG	008	016	And he took the elders of the city, and the thorns of the wilderness and briers, and chastised with them the men of Succoth.
007	JDG	008	017	And the tower of Penuel he beat down, and slew the men of the city.
007	JDG	008	018	And he said unto Zebach and Zalmunna', What kind of men were those whom ye slew at Tabor! And they answered, As thou art, so were they; one was in form like that of the children of a king.
007	JDG	008	019	And he said, They were my brothers, the sons of my mother; as the Lord liveth, if ye had spared them alive, I would not slay you.
007	JDG	008	020	And he said unto Yether his first-born, Rise up, and slay them. But the youth drew not his sword; for he was afraid, because he was yet a youth.
007	JDG	008	021	Then said Zebach and Zalmunna', Rise thou, and fall upon us; for as the man is, so is his strength. And Gid'on arose, and slew Zebach and Zalmunna'; and he took away the crescent ornaments that were on the necks of their camels.
007	JDG	008	022	And the men of Israel said unto Gid'on, Rule thou over us, both thou and thy son, and thy son's son also; for thou hast delivered us out of the hand of Midian.
007	JDG	008	023	And Gid'on said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the Lord shall rule over you.
007	JDG	008	024	And Gid'on said unto them, I would ask one request of you, that ye should give me every man the earring of his booty; for they had had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.
007	JDG	008	025	And they answered, We will willingly give. And they spread out a garment, and they cast therein every man the earring of his booty.
007	JDG	008	026	And the weight of the golden earrings that he had requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; besides the crescent ornaments, and ear-drops, and purple garments that were on the kings of Midian, and besides the chains that were about their camels' necks.
007	JDG	008	027	And Gid'on made thereof an ephod, and set it up in his city, in 'Ophrah: and all Israel went astray after it thither; and it became a snare unto Gid'on, and to his house.
007	JDG	008	028	And Midian was humbled before the children of Israel, so that they lifted not up their head any more. And the country was quiet forty years in the days of Gid'on.
007	JDG	008	029	And Yerubba'al the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.
007	JDG	008	030	And Gid'on had seventy sons begotten of his body; for he had many wives.
007	JDG	008	031	And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bore him a son, and he gave him the name, Abimelech.
007	JDG	008	032	And Gid'on the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in 'Ophrah of the Abi'ezrites.
007	JDG	008	033	And it came to pass, when Gid'on was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went astray after the Be'alim, and made themselves Ba'al-berith for a god.
007	JDG	008	034	And the children of Israel remembered not the Lord their God, who delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies on every side.
007	JDG	008	035	Neither showed they kindness to the house of Yerubba'al, namely, Gid'on, in accordance with all the good which he had done unto Israel.
007	JDG	009	001	And Abimelech the son of Yerubba'al went to Shechem unto his mother's brothers, and spoke unto them, and unto all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying,
007	JDG	009	002	Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, What is better for you, either that there should rule over you seventy men, all the sons of Yerubba'al, or that there reign over you one man? and remember that I am your bone and your flesh.
007	JDG	009	003	And his mother's brothers spoke concerning him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words; and their heart became inclined after Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother.
007	JDG	009	004	And they gave him seventy pieces of silver out of the house of Ba'al-berith; and Abimelech hired therewith idle and heedless persons, who followed him.
007	JDG	009	005	And he came unto his father's house at 'Ophrah, and slew his brothers the sons of Yeruhba'al, seventy persons, upon one stone; and there was yet left Yotham the youngest son of Yerubba'al; for he had hidden himself.
007	JDG	009	006	And all the men of Shechem and all Beth-millo assembled together, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the oak of the pillar that was by Shechem.
007	JDG	009	007	And they told it to Yotham; and he went and stood on the top of mount Gerizzim, and he lifted up his voice, and cried; and he said unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, so that God may hearken unto you.
007	JDG	009	008	The trees went once forth to anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive-tree, Reign thou over us.
007	JDG	009	009	But the olive-tree said unto them, Should I give up my fatness, wherewith through me they honor God and men, and shall I go to be promoted over the trees!
007	JDG	009	010	And the trees said to the fig-tree, Come thou, reign over us.
007	JDG	009	011	But the fig-tree said unto them, Should I give up my sweetness, and my good productiveness, and go to be promoted over the trees?
007	JDG	009	012	Then said the trees unto the vine, Come thou, reign over us.
007	JDG	009	013	But the vine said unto them, Should I give up my fresh wine, which rejoiceth God and men, and go to be promoted over the trees!
007	JDG	009	014	Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, reign over us.
007	JDG	009	015	And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me as king over you, then come seek protection in my shadow; and if not, then let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of the Lebanon.
007	JDG	009	016	And now, if ye have acted in truth and sincerity, when ye made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Yerubba'al and his house, and have done unto him according to the merit of his hands;
007	JDG	009	017	(In that my father fought for you, and cast his life far away, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian;
007	JDG	009	018	While ye are risen up against my father's house this day, and have slain his sons, seventy men, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maid-servant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother;)
007	JDG	009	019	If ye have thus acted in truth and sincerity with Yerubba'al and with his house this day: then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you.
007	JDG	009	020	But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem and Beth-millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from Beth-millo, and devour Abimelech.
007	JDG	009	021	And Yotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.
007	JDG	009	022	And Abimelech ruled over Israel three years;
007	JDG	009	023	And then did God send an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem became unfaithful toward Abimelech;
007	JDG	009	024	So that the violence [done] to the seventy sons of Yerubba'al might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother, who had slain them; and upon the men of Shechem, who had strengthened his hands to slay his brothers.
007	JDG	009	025	And the men of Shechem set persons to lie in wait for him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all that passed by them on that way: and it was told unto Abimelech.
007	JDG	009	026	And there came Ga'al the son of 'Ebed with his brothers, and passed through Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.
007	JDG	009	027	And they went out into the field, and gathered their vineyards, and trod [the grapes], and made joyful feasts, and went into the house of their god, and ate and drank, and cursed Abimelech.
007	JDG	009	028	And Ga'al the son of 'Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of Yerubba'al? and Zebul his superintendent? serve the men of Chamor the father of Shechem; for why indeed should we serve him?
007	JDG	009	029	And O that some one would put this people into my power! and I would remove Abimelech. And he let it be said to Abimelech, Increase thy army, and come out.
007	JDG	009	030	And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Ga'al the son of 'Ebed, his anger was kindled.
007	JDG	009	031	And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privately, saying, Behold, Ga'al the son of 'Ebed and his brothers are come to Shechem; and, behold, they incite the city to enmity against thee.
007	JDG	009	032	And now rise up by night, thou and the people that are with thee, and lie in wait in the field:
007	JDG	009	033	And it shall be, in the morning, the moment the sun shineth, that thou shalt rise early, and set upon the city; and, behold, when he and the people that are with him come out against thee, then mayest thou do to him as thy means may let thee.
007	JDG	009	034	And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by night, and they lay in wait against Shechem in four companies.
007	JDG	009	035	And Ga'al the son of 'Ebed went out, and stood in the entrance of the city-gate: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with him, from the ambush.
007	JDG	009	036	And when Ga'al saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, people are coming down from the tops of the mountains. And Zebul said unto him, Thou regardest the shadow of the mountains as men.
007	JDG	009	037	And Ga'al spoke again and said, See people are coming down from the highest point of the land, and one company is coming along by the way of the grove of Me'onenim.
007	JDG	009	038	Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now thy mouth, wherewith thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him! is not this the people that thou hast despised? go out now, I pray, and fight with them.
007	JDG	009	039	And Ga'al went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.
007	JDG	009	040	And Abimelech pursued him, and he fled before him, and many fell slain, even as far as the entrance of the gate.
007	JDG	009	041	And Abimelech remained at Arumah: and Zebul banished Ga'al and his brothers, that they should not remain in Shechem.
007	JDG	009	042	And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and it was told to Abimelech.
007	JDG	009	043	And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and lay in wait in the field; and as he saw, and, behold, that the people were coming forth out of the city, he rose up against them, and smote them.
007	JDG	009	044	And Abimelech, and the companies that were with him, spread forward, and took position in the entrance of the city-gate: and the two other companies spread over all that were in the fields, and smote them.
007	JDG	009	045	And Ahimelech fought against the city all that day; and he captured the city, and the people that were therein he slew; and he beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.
007	JDG	009	046	And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard this, they entered into the stronghold of the house of the god Berith.
007	JDG	009	047	And it was told unto Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.
007	JDG	009	048	And Abimelech went thereupon up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from a tree, and bore it, and laid it on his shoulder; and he said unto the people that were with him, What ye have seen that I have done, make haste, and do like me.
007	JDG	009	049	And all the people also cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put the same to the stronghold, and set the stronghold over them on fire: and thus died also all the people of the tower of Shechem, about a thousand men and women.
007	JDG	009	050	And Abimelech went then to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and captured it.
007	JDG	009	051	But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and the women, and all the chief persons of the city, and shut the doors behind them, and went up to the roof of the tower.
007	JDG	009	052	And Abimelech came up to the tower, and fought against it, and approached as far as the door of the tower to burn it with fire.
007	JDG	009	053	But a certain woman cast a piece of an upper millstone upon Abimelech's head, and crushed his skull.
007	JDG	009	054	Then called he hastily unto the young man that bore his armor, and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that people may not say of me, A woman hath slain him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.
007	JDG	009	055	And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man to his place.
007	JDG	009	056	Thus did God compensate the evil of Abimelech, which he had done unto his father, in slaying his seventy brothers:
007	JDG	009	057	And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God bring back upon their own head; and there came upon them the curse of Yotham the son of Yerubba'al.
007	JDG	010	001	And there arose after Abimelech to deliver Israel Tola' the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in the mountain of Ephraim.
007	JDG	010	002	And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and then died, and was buried in Shamir.
007	JDG	010	003	And after him arose Yair, the Gil'adite, and judged Israel twenty and two years;
007	JDG	010	004	And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass-colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Chavvoth-yair unto this day, which are in the land of Gil'ad.
007	JDG	010	005	And Yair died, and was buried in Kamon.
007	JDG	010	006	And the children of Israel repeated to do the evil in the eyes of the Lord, and they served the Be'alim, and 'Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of 'Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and they forsook the Lord, and served not him.
007	JDG	010	007	And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the children of 'Ammon.
007	JDG	010	008	And they afflicted and oppressed the children of Israel that year; [and] for eighteen years all the children of Israel that were on the other side of the Jordan in the land of the Emorites, which is in Gil'ad.
007	JDG	010	009	And the children of 'Ammon passed over the Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was sorely distressed.
007	JDG	010	010	And the children of Israel cried unto the Lord, saying, We have sinned against thee, because we have forsaken our God, and have served the Be'alim.
007	JDG	010	011	And the Lord said unto the children of Israel, Behold [I delivered you] from the Egyptians, and from the Emorites, from the children of 'Ammon, and from the Philistines.
007	JDG	010	012	And when the Zidonians, and the 'Amalekites, and the Ma'onites did oppress you, and ye cried to me, I delivered you also out of their hand.
007	JDG	010	013	And yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods; wherefore I will deliver you no more.
007	JDG	010	014	Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let these deliver you in the time of your tribulation.
007	JDG	010	015	And the children of Israel said unto the Lord, We have sinned: do thou unto us entirely as it seemeth good in thy eyes; only deliver us, we pray thee, this time.
007	JDG	010	016	And they put away the strange gods from their midst, and served the Lord; and his soul was grieved for the trouble of Israel.
007	JDG	010	017	And the children of 'Ammon were called together, and they encamped in Gil'ad. And the children of Israel also assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpah.
007	JDG	010	018	And the people, the princes of Gil'ad, said one to another, Whatever man it be that will begin to fight against the children of 'Ammon, shall become the head over all the inhabitants of Gil'ad.
007	JDG	011	001	Now Yiphthach the Gil'adite was a mighty man of valor, but he was the son of a harlot; and Gil'ad had begotten Yiphthach.
007	JDG	011	002	And the wife of Gil'ad also bore him sons; and when the sons of the wife were grown up, they drove away Yiphthach, and said unto him, Thou shalt not inherit in the house of our father: for the son of another woman art thou.
007	JDG	011	003	And Yiphthach fled away from his brothers, and dwelt in the land of Tob; and there gathered themselves to Yiphthach idle men, and they went out with him.
007	JDG	011	004	And it came to pass after some time, that the children of 'Ammon made war against Israel.
007	JDG	011	005	And it was so, when the children of 'Ammon made war against Israel, that the elders of Gil'ad went to fetch Yiphthach out of the land of Tob.
007	JDG	011	006	And they said unto Yiphthach, Come, and become a leader unto us, that we may fight with the children of 'Ammon.
007	JDG	011	007	And Yiphthach said unto the elders of Gil'ad, Did ye not hate me, and drive me away out of my father's house? and why are ye come unto me now, when ye are in distress?
007	JDG	011	008	And the elders of Gil'ad said unto Yiphthach, Therefore are we now come back to thee, that thou mayest go with us, and fight against the children of 'Ammon; and thou shalt become unto us a head, unto all the inhabitants of Gil'ad.
007	JDG	011	009	And Yiphthach said unto the elders of Gil'ad, If ye bring me home again to fight against the children of 'Ammon, and the Lord give them up before me, shall I remain your head?
007	JDG	011	010	And the elders of Gil'ad said unto Yiphthach, The Lord shall be a hearer between us, if we do not so according to thy word.
007	JDG	011	011	Then went Yiphthach with the elders of Gil'ad, and the people appointed him over them as head and as leader; and Yiphthach spoke all his words before the Lord in Mitzpah.
007	JDG	011	012	And Yiphthach sent messengers unto the king of the children of 'Ammon, saying, What have I to do with thee, that thou art come unto me to fight against my land?
007	JDG	011	013	And the king of the children of 'Ammon said unto the messengers of Yiphthach, Because Israel took away my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from the Arnon even unto the Yabbok, and unto the Jordan: and now restore these [lands] again in peace.
007	JDG	011	014	And Yiphthach again sent messengers unto the king of the children of 'Ammon;
007	JDG	011	015	And he said unto him, Thus hath said Yiphthach, Israel did not take away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of 'Ammon;
007	JDG	011	016	For when they came up out of Egypt, Israel walked through the wilderness unto the Red Sea, and came to Kadesh;
007	JDG	011	017	And Israel then sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me pass, I pray thee, through thy land; but the king of Edom would not hearken; and also to the king of Moab they sent; but he would not consent: and Israel remained in Kadesh.
007	JDG	011	018	Then they wandered through the wilderness, and traveled round the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came from the rising of the sun to the land of Moab, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon: but they came not within the border of Moab; for the Arnon is the boundary of Moab.
007	JDG	011	019	And Israel sent messengers unto Sichon the king of the Emorites, the king of Cheshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land unto my place.
007	JDG	011	020	But Sichon trusted not Israel to [let them] pass through his territory; and Sichon assembled all his people, and encamped in Yahaz, and fought against Israel.
007	JDG	011	021	and the Lord the God of Israel delivered Sichon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them; and Israel took possession of all the land of the Emorites, the inhabitants of that country.
007	JDG	011	022	And they took possession of all the territory of the Emorites, from the Arnon even unto the Yabbok, and from the wilderness even unto the Jordan.
007	JDG	011	023	So now the Lord the God of Israel hath dispossessed the Emorites from before his people Israel, and shouldst thou possess it?
007	JDG	011	024	Truly! that which Kemosh thy god may give thee to possess, even that canst thou possess; but whatsoever the Lord our God hath driven out from before us, even that will we possess.
007	JDG	011	025	And now art thou then any better than Balak the son of Zippor, the king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them?
007	JDG	011	026	[And] while Israel hath dwelt in Cheshbon and in its towns, and in 'Ar'or and in its towns, and in all the cities that are along the margins of the Arnon, three hundred years: why did ye not recover them within that time?
007	JDG	011	027	Whereas I myself have not sinned against thee, and thou doest me wrong to war against me: may the Lord, the Judge, decide this day between the children of Israel and the children of 'Ammon.
007	JDG	011	028	Nevertheless the king of the children of 'Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Yiphthach which he had sent to him.
007	JDG	011	029	Then came upon Yiphthach the spirit of the Lord, and he passed through Gil'ad and Menasseh, and passed through Mitzpeh of Gil'ad, and from Mitzpeh of Gil'ad he passed over unto the children of Ammon.
007	JDG	011	030	And Yiphthach made a vow unto the Lord, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver the children of 'Ammon into my hand,
007	JDG	011	031	Then shall it be, that whatsoever cometh forth out of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of 'Ammon, shall belong to the Lord, and I will offer it up for a burnt-offering.
007	JDG	011	032	So Yiphthach passed over unto the children of 'Ammon to fight against them: and the Lord delivered them into his hand.
007	JDG	011	033	And he smote them from 'Aro'er, even till thou comest to Minnith, twenty cities, and unto Abel-keramin, with a very great defeat; and the children of 'Ammon were humbled before the children of Israel.
007	JDG	011	034	And Yiphthach came to Mizpah unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his sole child; he had beside her neither son nor daughter.
007	JDG	011	035	And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his garments, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast bent me down very low, and thou art one of those that trouble me; for I have opened my mouth unto the Lord, and I cannot go back.
007	JDG	011	036	And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the Lord, do to me in accordance with what hath proceeded out of thy mouth; since the Lord hath taken vengeance for thee on thy enemies, on the children of 'Ammon.
007	JDG	011	037	And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: Let me alone two months, that I may descend to the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I with my companions.
007	JDG	011	038	And he aid, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity on the mountains.
007	JDG	011	039	And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, and he fulfilled on her his vow which he had vowed; and she knew no man; and it became a custom in Israel,
007	JDG	011	040	That the daughters of Israel went from year to year to lament for the daughter of Yiphthach the Gil'adite four days in the year.
007	JDG	012	001	And the men of Ephraim were called together, and went northward, and said unto Yiphthach, Wherefore didst thou pass over to fight against the children of 'Ammon, and didst not call for us to go with thee? thy house will we burn over thee with fire.
007	JDG	012	002	And Yiphthach said unto them, I and my people were greatly engaged in strife with the children of 'Ammon; and I called you, but ye helped me not out of their hand.
007	JDG	012	003	And when I saw that ye helped me not, I put my life in my hand, and passed over to the children of 'Ammon, and the Lord delivered them into my hand; and why then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me?
007	JDG	012	004	Then Yiphthach gathered together all the men of Gil'ad, and fought with Ephraim; and the men of Gil'ad smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye are fugitives of Ephraim: Gil'ad is in the midst, between Ephraim and Menasseh.
007	JDG	012	005	And the Gil'adites seized on the passages of the Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it came to pass, when the Ephraimites who had escaped said, Let me pass over; that the men of Gil'ad said unto him, Art thou an Ephrathite? and if he said, No;
007	JDG	012	006	Then said they unto him, Do say, Shibboleth; but when he said, Sibboleth, and was not able to pronounce it correctly, they laid hold of him and slew him on the passages of the Jordan; and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand.
007	JDG	012	007	And Yiphthach judged Israel six years; and then died Yiphthach the Gil'adite, and was buried in [one of] the cities of Gil'ad.
007	JDG	012	008	And after him there judged Israel Ibzan of Beth-lechem.
007	JDG	012	009	And he had thirty sons; and thirty daughters he sent abroad, and thirty daughters he brought in for his sons from abroad: and he judged Israel seven years.
007	JDG	012	010	Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Beth-lechem.
007	JDG	012	011	And after him there judged Israel Elon the Zebulonite; and he judged Israel ten years.
007	JDG	012	012	Then died Elon the Zebulonite, and was buried in Ayalon in the country of Zebulun.
007	JDG	012	013	And after him there judged Israel 'Abdon the son of Hillel the Pir'athonite.
007	JDG	012	014	And he had forty sons and thirty grandsons, that rode on seventy ass-colts; and he judged Israel eight years.
007	JDG	012	015	Then died 'Abdon the son of Hillel the Pir'athonite, and was buried in Pir'athon in the land of Ephraim, in the mountain of the 'Amalekites.
007	JDG	013	001	And the children of Israel did again the evil in the eyes of the Lord; and the Lord delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.
007	JDG	013	002	And there was a certain man of Zor'ah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoach; and his wife was barren, and did not bear.
007	JDG	013	003	And there appeared an angel of the Lord unto the woman, and he said unto her, Behold, thou art barren, and hast not born; but thou wilt conceive, and bear a son.
007	JDG	013	004	And now do beware, and drink neither wine nor strong drink, and eat not any thing unclean.
007	JDG	013	005	For, lo, thou wilt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head; for a Nazarite of God shall the lad be from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.
007	JDG	013	006	And the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his appearance was like the appearance of an angel of God, very terrible; but I asked him not whence he might be, and his name he did not tell me.
007	JDG	013	007	And he said unto me, Behold, thou wilt conceive, and bear a son; and now thou must drink neither wine nor strong drink, and not eat anything unclean; for the child shall be a Nazarite of God from the womb until the day of his death.
007	JDG	013	008	And Manoach entreated the Lord, and said, Hear me, O Lord, let the man of God, whom thou didst send, come again unto us, and instruct us what we shall do unto the child that is to be born.
007	JDG	013	009	And God hearkened to the voice of Manoach; and the angel of God came again unto the woman, as she was sitting in the field; and Manoach her husband was not with her.
007	JDG	013	010	And the woman made haste, and ran, and informed her husband; and she said unto him, Behold, there hath appeared unto me the man, that came unto me the other day.
007	JDG	013	011	And Manoach arose, and went after his wife; and he came to the man, and said unto him, Art thou the man that spokest unto the woman? and he said, I am.
007	JDG	013	012	And Manoach said, If now thy words come to pass, what shall be [our] proceeding with the child, and what shall be done unto him?
007	JDG	013	013	And the angel of the Lord said unto Manoach, Of all that I have said unto the woman must she beware.
007	JDG	013	014	Of any thing that cometh of the grape-vine she may not eat, and wine or strong drink she may not drink, and any thing unclean she may not eat: all that I commanded her must she observe.
007	JDG	013	015	And Manoach said unto the angel of the Lord, Let us, I pray thee, detain thee, and we will make a kid ready for thee.
007	JDG	013	016	And the angel of the Lord said unto Manoach, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread; but if thou wilt offer a burnt-offering, thou must offer it unto the Lord; for Manoach knew not that he was an angel of the Lord.
007	JDG	013	017	And Manoach said unto the angel of the Lord, What is thy name, that, when thy word cometh to pass, we may do thee honor?
007	JDG	013	018	And the angel of the Lord said unto him, Why is it that thou wilt ask after my name, seeing it is secret?
007	JDG	013	019	And Manoach took the kid and the meat-offering, and offered it upon the rock unto the Lord: and he did wondrously; and Manoach and his wife looked on.
007	JDG	013	020	And it came to pass, when the flame went up from off the altar toward heaven, that the angel of the Lord ascended in the flame of the altar; and Manoach and his wife looked on, and they fell on their faces to the ground.
007	JDG	013	021	And the angel of the Lord was no longer visible to Manoach and to his wife: then knew Manoach that he was an angel of the Lord.
007	JDG	013	022	And Manoach said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because a divine being have we seen.
007	JDG	013	023	But his wife said unto him, If the Lord were pleased to kill us, he would not have received from our hand a burnt-offering and a meat-offering, nor would he have let us see all these things, and at this time he would not have let us hear [such a thing] as this.
007	JDG	013	024	And the woman bore a son, and called his name Samson; and the child grew up, and the Lord blessed him.
007	JDG	013	025	And the Spirit of the Lord began to move him in Machaneh-dan between Zor'ah and Eshtaol.
007	JDG	014	001	And Samson went down to Timnathah, and saw a woman in Timnathah of the daughters of the Philistines.
007	JDG	014	002	And he went up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnathah of the daughters of the Philistines; and now take her to me for wife.
007	JDG	014	003	Then said unto him his father and his mother, Is there not among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, a woman, that thou art going to take a wife from the Philistines, the uncircumcised? And Samson said unto his father, This one take for me; for she pleaseth me well.
007	JDG	014	004	But his father and his mother knew not that it was from the Lord, that he sought but an occasion against the Philistines; and at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.
007	JDG	014	005	And Samson thus went down, with his father and his mother, to Timnathah; and when they were come as far as the vineyards of Timnathah, behold, a young lion came roaring toward him.
007	JDG	014	006	And the Spirit of the Lord came suddenly over him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand; but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.
007	JDG	014	007	And he went down, and spoke unto the woman; and she pleased Samson well.
007	JDG	014	008	And when he returned after a time to take her, he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees in the carcass of the lion and honey likewise.
007	JDG	014	009	And he took it out in his hands, and went on, eating as he was going, and came to his father and mother, and he gave unto them, and they did eat; but he told them not that out of the carcass of the lion he had taken the honey.
007	JDG	014	010	And his father went down unto the woman; and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.
007	JDG	014	011	And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions, and they remained with him.
007	JDG	014	012	And Samson said unto them, I will now propound unto you a riddle; if ye can in anywise tell it me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then will I give you thirty shirts and thirty changes of garments;
007	JDG	014	013	But if ye will not be able to tell it to me, then shall ye give me thirty shirts and thirty changes of garments. And they said unto him, Propound thy riddle, that we may hear it.
007	JDG	014	014	And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth food, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not solve the riddle in three days.
007	JDG	014	015	And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson's wife, Persuade thy husband, that he may solve unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire: have ye invited us to impoverish us? is it not so?
007	JDG	014	016	And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou doest but hate me, and lovest me not: that riddle hast thou propounded unto the children of my people, and me hast thou not told [the solution]. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it to my father and to my mother, and thee shall I tell it?
007	JDG	014	017	And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted; and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she had worried him: and she told [the solution of] the riddle to the children of her people.
007	JDG	014	018	Then said unto him the men of the city on the seventh day before the sun was yet gone down, What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion? And he said unto them, If ye had not ploughed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.
007	JDG	014	019	And the Spirit of the Lord came suddenly over him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew of them thirty men, and he took their apparel, and gave the changes of garments unto the expounders of the riddle; but his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house.
007	JDG	014	020	And Samson's wife was given to his companion who had been given him as his associate.
007	JDG	015	001	And it came to pass after some time, in the time of wheat-harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, Let me go in to my wife into the chamber; but her father would not suffer him to go in.
007	JDG	015	002	And her father said, I verily thought that thou didst utterly hate her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger sister fairer than she? Let her be thine, I pray thee, instead of her.
007	JDG	015	003	And Samson said to them, Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do them evil.
007	JDG	015	004	And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took torches, and turned tail to tail, and put one torch between two tails in the midst;
007	JDG	015	005	And he set the torches on fire, and let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both shocks and standing corn, as also olive-yards.
007	JDG	015	006	Then said the Philistines, Who hath done this! And they answered, Samson, the son-in-law of the Thimnite, because he hath taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines went up, and burnt her and her father with fire.
007	JDG	015	007	And Samson said unto them, Since ye will do the like of this, I will surely be avenged on you, and after that will I cease.
007	JDG	015	008	And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter; and he went down and tarried in the cleft of the rock 'Etam.
007	JDG	015	009	And the Philistines went up, and encamped in Judah, and spread themselves in Lechi.
007	JDG	015	010	And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And they answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us.
007	JDG	015	011	Thereupon went three thousand men of Judah down to the cleft of the rock 'Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines rule over us? and what is this that thou hast done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them.
007	JDG	015	012	And they said unto him, To bind thee are we come down, to deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not assail me yourselves.
007	JDG	015	013	And they said unto him, thus, No; for we will [only] bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand; but we will in no-wise kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock.
007	JDG	015	014	When he was come unto Lechi, the Philistines shouted against him; but the Spirit of the Lord came suddenly over him, and the cords that were upon his arms became as flax threads that are burnt with fire, and his bands melted from off his hands.
007	JDG	015	015	And he found a fresh jaw-bone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and smote therewith a thousand men.
007	JDG	015	016	And Samson said, With a jaw-bone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw-bone of an ass have I smitten a thousand men.
007	JDG	015	017	And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jaw-bone out of his hand, and called that place Ramath-lechi.
007	JDG	015	018	And he became very thirsty, and he called on the Lord, and said, Thou hast granted through the hand of thy servant this great deliverance; and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?
007	JDG	015	019	But God clave a hollow place that was at Lechi, and there came forth water out of it; and he drank, and his spirit came again, and he revived; wherefore he called the name thereof 'En-hakkore, which is in Lechi unto this day.
007	JDG	015	020	And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.
007	JDG	016	001	Then went Samson to Gazzah, and saw there a harlot, and went in unto her.
007	JDG	016	002	And it was told to the Gazzites, saying, Samson is come hither: and they compassed him in, and lay in wait for him all the night in the gate of the city, and held themselves quiet all the night, saying, By the time it is light in the morning will we kill him.
007	JDG	016	003	And Samson lay till midnight; but he arose at midnight, and took hold of the doors of the city-gate, and the two door-posts, and tore them away with the bolt, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of the mount that is before Hebron.
007	JDG	016	004	And it came to pass after this, that he loved a woman in the valley of Shorek, whose name was Delilah.
007	JDG	016	005	And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Persuade him, and see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what means we may prevail over him, that we may bind him to subdue him: and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.
007	JDG	016	006	And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith thou canst be bound to subdue thee.
007	JDG	016	007	And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven moist cords which have not yet been dried, then shall I become weak, and be like any other of mankind.
007	JDG	016	008	And the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven moist cords which had not yet been dried, and she bound him with them.
007	JDG	016	009	And she had men lying in wait, sitting near her in the chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he tore the cords, as a thread of tow is torn when it toucheth the fire; and his strength was not perceived.
007	JDG	016	010	And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast deceived me, and told me lies; now do tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou canst be bound.
007	JDG	016	011	And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that have never been used in work, then shall I become weak, and be like any other of mankind.
007	JDG	016	012	And Delilah took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And the liers in wait were sitting in the chamber. But he tore them from off his arms like a thread.
007	JDG	016	013	And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast deceived me, and told me lies; do tell me wherewith thou canst be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.
007	JDG	016	014	And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he awakened out of his sleep, and tore away the pin of the loom, with the web.
007	JDG	016	015	And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thy heart is not with me? these three times hast thou deceived me, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.
007	JDG	016	016	And it came to pass, when she worried him daily with her words, and urged him, that his soul became impatient to die;
007	JDG	016	017	And he told her all his heart, and said unto her, A razor hath not passed over my head; for a Nazarite of God have I been from my mother's womb; if I were shaved, my strength would depart from me, and I should become weak, and be like all other men.
007	JDG	016	018	And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once; for he hath told me all his heart. Then came the lords of the Philistines up unto her, and brought the money in their hand.
007	JDG	016	019	And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called a man, and caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to subdue him, and his strength departed from him.
007	JDG	016	020	And she said, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and thought, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself free. But he knew not that the Lord had departed from him.
007	JDG	016	021	And the Philistines seized him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gazzah, and bound him with fetters of copper; and he had to grind in the prison-house.
007	JDG	016	022	But the hair of his head began to grow again after it was shaved off.
007	JDG	016	023	And the lords of the Philistines gathered themselves together to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice; and they said, Our god hath delivered into our hand Samson our enemy.
007	JDG	016	024	And when the people saw him, they praised their god; for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hand our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, and him who hath slain so many of us.
007	JDG	016	025	And it came to pass, when their heart was merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make sport for us. And they called for Samson out of the prison-house; and he made sport before them; and they placed him between the pillars.
007	JDG	016	026	And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me [to go] and let me feel the pillars whereupon the house is supported, that I may lean upon them.
007	JDG	016	027	Now the house was full of men and women; and there were all the lords of the Philistines; and upon the roof were about three thousand men and women, that looked on while Samson made sport.
007	JDG	016	028	And Samson called unto the Lord, and said, O Lord Eternal, remember me, I pray thee, and do thou strengthen me only this once, O God, that I may be avenged for one of my two eyes on the Philistines.
007	JDG	016	029	And Samson threw his arms around the two middle pillars upon which the house was supported, and he leaned on them, [on] one with his right hand, and [on] the other with his left.
007	JDG	016	030	And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bent [them] with might, and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead whom he slew at his death were more than those whom he had slain in his life.
007	JDG	016	031	Then came down his brothers and all the house of his father, and they took him up, and carried him up, and buried him between Zor'ah and Eshtaol, in the burying-place of Manoach his father. And he had judged Israel twenty years.
007	JDG	017	001	And there was a man of the mountain of Ephraim, whose name was Michayhu.
007	JDG	017	002	And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spokest of also in my ears, —behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be my son unto the Lord.
007	JDG	017	003	And he restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother; and his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the Lord from my hand, for my son, to make a graven and molten image; and now I will give it back unto thee.
007	JDG	017	004	Yet he gave the money back unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the silversmith, who made thereof a graven and molten image; and it was in the house of Micah.
007	JDG	017	005	And the man Micah had a house of god, and he made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.
007	JDG	017	006	In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did what seemed right in his own eyes.
007	JDG	017	007	And there was a young man out of Beth-lechem-judah of the family of Judah, but he was a Levite, and sojourned there.
007	JDG	017	008	And the man departed from the city, from Beth-lechem-judah, to sojourn where he could find [a place]; and he came to the mountain of Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he was pursuing his journey.
007	JDG	017	009	And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I am a Levite from Beth-lechem-judah, and I go to sojourn where I may find [a place].
007	JDG	017	010	And Micah said unto him, Remain with me, and become unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten shekels of silver for the year, and suitable apparel, and thy victuals. And the Levite went in.
007	JDG	017	011	And the Levite consented to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.
007	JDG	017	012	And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and remained in the house of Micah.
007	JDG	017	013	Then said Micah, Now I know that the Lord will do me good, seeing I have obtained a Levite for priest.
007	JDG	018	001	In those days there was no king in Israel; and in those days the tribe of the Danites were seeking for themselves an inheritance to dwell in; for there had not fallen to their share up to that day among the tribes of Israel a [sufficient] inheritance.
007	JDG	018	002	And the children of Dan sent from their family five men from among themselves, men of valor, from Zor'ah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land. And they came to the mountain of Ephraim, as far as the house of Micah, and lodged there.
007	JDG	018	003	They were just by the house of Micah, when they recognized the voice of the young man the Levite; and they turned in thither, and said unto him, Who brought thee hither? and what doest thou in this place? and what hast thou here?
007	JDG	018	004	And he said unto them, Thus and thus hath Micah done unto me; and he hired me, and I became his priest.
007	JDG	018	005	And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way on which we are going shall be prosperous.
007	JDG	018	006	And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the Lord is your way on which ye will go.
007	JDG	018	007	And the five men departed, and came to Layish, and saw the people that were therein, dwelling in security, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and no one inflicted any wrong in the land, as hereditary ruler; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no concern with any man.
007	JDG	018	008	And they came unto their brethren to Zor'ah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said unto them, What [news bring] ye?
007	JDG	018	009	And they said, Arise, and let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and you keep still! be not slothful, to go, to enter to take possession of the land.
007	JDG	018	010	When ye enter, ye will come unto a secure people, and the land is roomy; for God hath given it into your hand; a place where there is no want of anything that is on the earth.
007	JDG	018	011	And there went from there of the family of the Danites, out of Zor'ah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men girded with weapons of war.
007	JDG	018	012	And they went up, and encamped in Kiryath-ye'arim, in Judah; wherefore they called that place Machaneh-dan until this day; behold, it is behind Kiryath-ye'arim.
007	JDG	018	013	And they passed thence unto the mountain of Ephraim, and came as far as the house of Micah.
007	JDG	018	014	Then commenced the five men that had gone to spy out the country of Layish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there are in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven and molten image? and now consider what ye have to do.
007	JDG	018	015	And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, unto the house of Micah, and asked him after his welfare.
007	JDG	018	016	And the six hundred men who were of the children of Dan, girded with their weapons of war, remained standing by the entrance of the gate.
007	JDG	018	017	And the five men that had gone to spy out the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image; and the priest stood in the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men that were girded with the weapons of war.
007	JDG	018	018	And these went into Micah's house, and took the graven image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image; and the priest said unto them, What are ye doing?
007	JDG	018	019	And they said unto him, Be still, lay thy hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and become to us a father and a priest: is it better that thou be a priest unto the house of one man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel?
007	JDG	018	020	And the priest's heart became glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and came into the midst of the people.
007	JDG	018	021	And they turned and went away, and placed the little ones and the cattle and the heavy things before them.
007	JDG	018	022	When they were at a distance from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah's house were called together, and they overtook the children of Dan.
007	JDG	018	023	And they called unto the children of Dan, who turned their faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou hast called out thy people?
007	JDG	018	024	And he said, My god which I made have ye taken away, and the priest, and are gone away; and what have I more? and what is this ye say unto me, What aileth thee?
007	JDG	018	025	And the children of Dan said unto him, Cause not thy voice to be heard among us, lest men of an embittered spirit assail thee, and thou lose thy life, with the life of thy household.
007	JDG	018	026	And the children of Dan went on their way; and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house.
007	JDG	018	027	And they took what Micah had made, and the priest whom he had had, and came over Layish, over a people that were quiet and secure; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and the city they burnt with fire.
007	JDG	018	028	And there was no deliverer; because it was far from Zidon, and the people had no business with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth by Beth-rechob. And they rebuilt the city, and dwelt therein.
007	JDG	018	029	And they called the name of the city, Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: nevertheless, Layish was the name of the city at first.
007	JDG	018	030	And the children of Dan erected for themselves the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Menasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the exile of the land.
007	JDG	018	031	And they set up for themselves Micah's graven image, which he had made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.
007	JDG	019	001	And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the lower edge of the mountain of Ephraim, who took to himself a concubine out of Beth-lechem-judah.
007	JDG	019	002	And his concubine became faithless unto him, and she went away from him unto her father's house to Beth-lechem-judah, and was there one year and four months.
007	JDG	019	003	And then her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto her, to bring her back; and he had his servant with him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father's house; and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.
007	JDG	019	004	And his father-in-law, the damsel's father, detained him; and he abode with him three days: and they ate and drank, and lodged there.
007	JDG	019	005	And it came to pass on the fourth day, that they arose early in the morning, and he rose up to depart; but the damsel's father said unto his son-in-law, Comfort thy heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward can ye go your way.
007	JDG	019	006	And they sat down, and both of them ate together and drank; and the damsel's father said unto the man, Do consent, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thy heart be merry.
007	JDG	019	007	Still the man rose up to depart; but his father-in-law urged him, and he turned back and lodged there.
007	JDG	019	008	And when he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart, the damsel's father said, Comfort thy heart, I pray thee, and tarry until the decline of the day: and both of them did eat.
007	JDG	019	009	And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father-in-law, the damsel's father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, tarry all night, I pray you: behold, it is the resting time of day, lodge here, and let thy heart be merry; and you may get early tomorrow on your way, and go then to thy tent.
007	JDG	019	010	But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and went away, and came as far as opposite Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and he had with him two saddled asses, and his concubine also was with him.
007	JDG	019	011	When they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn in unto this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.
007	JDG	019	012	And his master said unto him, We will not turn into one of the cities of the stranger, that are not belonging to the children of Israel; but we will pass on as far as Gib'ah.
007	JDG	019	013	And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of these places; and let us lodge all night in Gib'ah, or in Ramah.
007	JDG	019	014	And they passed on and went forward; and the sun went down unto them by Gib'ah, which belongeth to Benjamin.
007	JDG	019	015	And they turned aside thither, to go in to lodge in Gib'ah; and when he went in, he sat down in the street of the city; for there was no man that brought them into his house to lodge.
007	JDG	019	016	And, behold, an old man was coming from his work out of the field at evening, and this man was from the mountain of Ephraim, and he sojourned in Gib'ah; but the men of the place were Benjamites.
007	JDG	019	017	And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the wayfaring man in the street of the city: and then said the old man, Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?
007	JDG	019	018	And he said unto him, We are passing from Beth-lechem-judah toward the lower edge of the mountain of Ephraim; from there am I, and I went as far as Beth-lechem-judah; but I am going to the house of the Lord; and there is no man that bringeth me into his house.
007	JDG	019	019	Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there are also bread and wine for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man who is with thy servants; there is no want of any thing.
007	JDG	019	020	And the old man said, Peace be with thee; only let all thy wants lie upon me; at least lodge not in the street.
007	JDG	019	021	So he brought him to his house, and gave provender unto the asses: and they washed their feet, and they ate and drank.
007	JDG	019	022	As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, worthless people, beset the house round about, knocking at the door; and they said to the master of the house, the old man, thus, Bring forth the man that in come to thy house, that we may know him.
007	JDG	019	023	And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them, No, my brethren, I pray you, act not wickedly; since this man is once come into my house, do not this scandalous thing.
007	JDG	019	024	Behold, here is my daughter a virgin, and his concubine; let me bring them out now, and humble ye them, and do to them what seemeth good in your eyes; but unto this man do not this scandalous thing.
007	JDG	019	025	But the men would not hearken to him; so the man took hold of his concubine, and brought her forth unto them into the street; and they knew her, and ill-used her all the night until the morning; and they let her go when the day began to dawn.
007	JDG	019	026	Then came the woman [home] in the early part of the morning, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, [and lay] till it was light.
007	JDG	019	027	And when her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go on his way: behold, the woman, his concubine, was lying at the door of the house, with her hands upon the threshold.
007	JDG	019	028	And he said unto her, Rise up, and let us be going; but no one answered. Then he took her upon the ass, and the man rose up, and went unto his place.
007	JDG	019	029	And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, according to her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her about in all the territory of Israel.
007	JDG	019	030	And it happened, that whoever saw it said, There hath no such deed been done or seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt until this day: reflect well on it, give advice, and speak.
007	JDG	020	001	Then went out all the children of Israel, and the congregation was assembled together as one man, from Dan even to Beer-sheba', with the land of Gil'ad, unto the Lord in Mizpah.
007	JDG	020	002	and there presented themselves the chiefs of all the people, of all the tribes of Israel, in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand men on foot that drew the sword.
007	JDG	020	003	(And the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpah.) And the children of Israel said, Speak, how did this wickedness take place?
007	JDG	020	004	And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was murdered, answered and said, I came to Gib'ah that belongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to stay one night,
007	JDG	020	005	When the men of Gib'ah rose against me, and beset the house round about against me by night; me they intended to slay; and my concubine they humbled, so that she died.
007	JDG	020	006	And I took hold of my concubine and cut her in pieces, and sent her about throughout all the fields of the inheritance of Israel; for they had committed incest and scandal in Israel.
007	JDG	020	007	Behold, ye are all here children of Israel: furnish for yourselves here advice and counsel.
007	JDG	020	008	And all the people then arose as one man, saying, We will not go any of us to his tent, neither will we turn any of us into his house.
007	JDG	020	009	And now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gib'ah: We will go up against it by lot;
007	JDG	020	010	And we will take ten men out of every hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred out of every thousand, and a thousand out of every ten thousand, to procure provisions for the people; that they may do, when they come to Gib'ah of Benjamin, in accordance with all the scandalous deed that they have wrought in Israel.
007	JDG	020	011	So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, associated together as one man.
007	JDG	020	012	And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the divisions of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that hath been done among you?
007	JDG	020	013	Now therefore deliver up the men, those worthless people, who are in Gib'ah, that we may put them to death, and remove evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel.
007	JDG	020	014	And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gib'ah, to go out to battle with the children of Israel.
007	JDG	020	015	And at that time there were numbered of the children of Benjamin out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew the sword, beside the inhabitants of Gib'ah, who were numbered seven hundred chosen men.
007	JDG	020	016	Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men lame in the right hand: every one of these could sling a stone at a hair, and would not miss.
007	JDG	020	017	And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew the sword: all these were men of war.
007	JDG	020	018	And they arose, and went up to Beth-el, and asked counsel of God; and the children of Israel said, Who of us shall go up at first to the battle with the children of Benjamin? And the Lord said, Judah, at first.
007	JDG	020	019	And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gib'ah.
007	JDG	020	020	And the men of Israel went out to battle with Benjamin; and the men of Israel put themselves in battle-array against them by Gib'ah.
007	JDG	020	021	And the Children of Benjamin came forth out of Gib'ah, and struck down to the ground of the Israelites on that day twenty and two thousand men.
007	JDG	020	022	And the people the men of Israel took courage, and set themselves again in battle-array in the place where they had arrayed themselves on the first day.
007	JDG	020	023	And the children of Israel went up and wept before the Lord until the evening, and asked counsel of the Lord, saying, Shall I again approach to battle with the children of Benjamin my brother? And the Lord said, Go up against him.
007	JDG	020	024	And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin on the second day.
007	JDG	020	025	And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gib'ah on the second day, and struck down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men: all these were men that drew the sword.
007	JDG	020	026	Now all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came unto Beth-el, and wept, and sat there before the Lord, and fasted on that day until the evening, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before the Lord.
007	JDG	020	027	And the children of Israel inquired of the Lord, (for there was the ark of the covenant of God in those days,
007	JDG	020	028	And Phinehas, the son of Elazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, shall I yet continue to go out to battle with the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I forbear? And the Lord said, Go up; for tomorrow will I deliver him into thy hand.
007	JDG	020	029	And Israel sent men to lie in wait round about Gib'ah.
007	JDG	020	030	And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gib'ah, as at previous times.
007	JDG	020	031	And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite some of the people, and kill, as at previous times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to Beth-el, and the other to Gib'ah in the field, about thirty men of Israel.
007	JDG	020	032	And the children of Benjamin said, They are defeated before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them from the city unto the highways.
007	JDG	020	033	And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array at Ba'al-thamar: and those that lay in wait of Israel rushed forth out of their place, out of the meadows of Gib'ah.
007	JDG	020	034	And there came against Gib'ah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was severe; but they knew not that the evil was overtaking them.
007	JDG	020	035	And the Lord smote Benjamin before Israel; and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjamites on that day twenty and five thousand and one hundred men: all these were those that drew the sword.
007	JDG	020	036	And the children of Benjamin saw that they were defeated; for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted unto those that lay in wait whom they had set against Gib'ah.
007	JDG	020	037	And those in ambush hastened, and spread themselves over Gib'ah; and those that lay in wait moved along, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword.
007	JDG	020	038	Now there was an understanding between the men of Israel and those that lay in wait, that they should make an abundance of columns of smoke rise up out of the city.
007	JDG	020	039	And when the men of Israel turned round in the battle, and Benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons; for they said, Surely they are entirely defeated before us, as in the first battle:
007	JDG	020	040	Then began the cloud to arise up out of the city as a pillar of smoke; and when the Benjamites looked behind them, behold, the flames of all the city were ascending up to heaven.
007	JDG	020	041	And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were amazed; for they saw that the evil had overtaken them.
007	JDG	020	042	Therefore they turned round before the men of Israel unto the way to the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and those who came out of the cities destroyed them in the midst of them.
007	JDG	020	043	They enclosed the Benjamites round about, chased them, they overtook them in their places of rest, as far as opposite to Gib'ah toward the rising of the sun.
007	JDG	020	044	And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men: all these were men of valor.
007	JDG	020	045	And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon; and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and they pursued hard after them as far as Gid'om, and slew of them two thousand men.
007	JDG	020	046	So that all who fell on that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword: all these were men of valor.
007	JDG	020	047	But six hundred men turned and fled into the wilderness unto the rock Rimmon, and they abode on the rock Rimmon four months.
007	JDG	020	048	And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of every city, as the beasts, and all that was found: also all the cities that they came upon did they set on fire.
007	JDG	021	001	Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah, saying, Not any of us shall give his daughter unto Benjamin for wife.
007	JDG	021	002	And the people came to Beth-el, and abode there till the evening, before God, and they lifted up their voices, and wept with a great lamentation;
007	JDG	021	003	And they said, Wherefore, O Lord, God of Israel, is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be lacking this day out of Israel one tribe?
007	JDG	021	004	And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings.
007	JDG	021	005	And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto the Lord? For there had been taken the great oath concerning him that came not up to the Lord to Mizpah, saying, He shall surely be put to death.
007	JDG	021	006	And the children of Israel felt regret for Benjamin their brother, and they said, One tribe hath this day been cut down from Israel.
007	JDG	021	007	What shall we do as respecteth wives for those that remain, since we have sworn by the Lord that we will give none of our daughters unto them for wives?
007	JDG	021	008	And they said, what one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up unto the Lord to Mizpah? And, behold, there had not come to the camp a man from Yabesh-gil'ad to the assembly.
007	JDG	021	009	For the people were numbered, and, behold, there was not present a man of the inhabitants of Yabesh-gil'ad.
007	JDG	021	010	And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand persons of the valiant men, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Yabesh-gil'ad with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children.
007	JDG	021	011	And this is the thing that ye shall do, every male, and every woman that hath known [man] by lying with him, shall ye devote.
007	JDG	021	012	And they found among the inhabitants of Yabesh-gil'ad four hundred young virgins that had not known man by lying with any male: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.
007	JDG	021	013	And the whole congregation sent and spoke to the children of Benjamin that were on the rock Rimmon, and offered them peace.
007	JDG	021	014	And Benjamin returned at that time: and they gave unto them the wives whom they had saved alive out of the women of Yabesh-gil'ad; but they found not sufficient for them in this way.
007	JDG	021	015	And the people felt regret for Benjamin; because that the Lord had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.
007	JDG	021	016	And the elders of the congregation said, What shall we do for those that remain as respecteth wives; because the women have been destroyed out of Benjamin?
007	JDG	021	017	And they said, Their inheritance must be secured for Benjamin, that not a tribe may be blotted out from Israel.
007	JDG	021	018	Nevertheless we ourselves are not able to give them wives of our daughters; for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin.
007	JDG	021	019	And they said, Behold, there is a feast of the Lord in Shiloh from year to year [at a place] which is on the north side of Beth-el, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Beth-el to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.
007	JDG	021	020	And they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go ye and lie in wait in the vineyards;
007	JDG	021	021	And look out, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh go out to dance in dances: then come ye forth out of the vineyards, and snatch you every man his wife from the daughters of Shiloh, and go then to the land of Benjamin.
007	JDG	021	022	And it shall be, when their fathers or their brothers come to contend with us, that we will say unto them, Be favorable unto them for our sakes; because we took not for each man his wife in the war; [and] because ye yourselves did not give them unto them, that ye should at this time be guilty.
007	JDG	021	023	And the children of Benjamin did so, and took themselves wives, according to their number, from the dancers whom they had stolen away; and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and rebuilt the cities, and dwelt in them.
007	JDG	021	024	And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from there every man to his inheritance.
007	JDG	021	025	In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did what was right in his own eyes.

# BOOK	008	RUT	Ruth	Ruth
008	RUT	001	001	And it came to pass in the days when the judges judged, that there was a famine in the land: and there went a certain man of Beth-lechem-judah to sojourn in the fields of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.
008	RUT	001	002	And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Na'omi, and the name of his two sons Machlon and Kilyon, Ephrathites of Beth-lechem-judah. And they came into the fields of Moab, and remained there.
008	RUT	001	003	Thereupon died Elimelech Na'omi's husband; and she was left, with her two sons.
008	RUT	001	004	And they took themselves wives of the women of Moab; the name of one was 'Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelt there about ten years.
008	RUT	001	005	And then died also both of these, Machlon and Kilyon, and the woman was left [deprived] of her two children and her husband.
008	RUT	001	006	Then did she arise with her daughters-in-law, and returned homeward from the fields of Moab; for she had heard in the fields of Moab that the Lord had thought of his people in giving them bread.
008	RUT	001	007	Therefore she went forth out of the place where she had been, and her two daughters-in-law [were] with her; and they went on their way to return unto the land of Judah.
008	RUT	001	008	Then said Na'omi unto her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each one to her mother's house: may the Lord deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.
008	RUT	001	009	May the Lord grant unto you that ye may find rest, each one in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voice, and wept.
008	RUT	001	010	And they said unto her, [No,] for truly we will return with thee unto thy people.
008	RUT	001	011	Then said Na'omi, Return back, my daughters; why will ye go with me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may become your husbands?
008	RUT	001	012	Return back, my daughters, go; for I am too old to become [the wife] of any man; yea, if I were even to think, I have hope; should I even obtain this night a husband, and should also bear sons:
008	RUT	001	013	Would ye wait in hopes for them till they were grown? would ye debar yourselves for them so as not to become the wives of any man? not so, my daughters; for I feel much more bitter pain than you; because the hand of the Lord is gone out against me.
008	RUT	001	014	And they lifted up their voice and wept a long time; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law; but Ruth cleaved unto her.
008	RUT	001	015	And she said, Behold, thy sister-in-law is returned back unto her people, and unto her gods; return thou after thy sister-in-law.
008	RUT	001	016	But Ruth said, Urge me not to leave thee, to return from following thee; for whither thou goest, will I go; and where thou lodgest, will I lodge; thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God.
008	RUT	001	017	Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried; may the Lord do so to me, and may he so continue, if aught but death shall part me from thee.
008	RUT	001	018	When she thus saw that she was persisting to go with her, she left off speaking unto her.
008	RUT	001	019	So these two went until they came to Beth-lechem. And it came to pass, when they entered Beth-lechem, that all the city was in commotion about them, and people said, Is this Na'omi?
008	RUT	001	020	And she said unto them, Call me not Na'omi, call me Mara; for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.
008	RUT	001	021	I went out full, but empty hath the Lord brought me home again; why then will ye call me Na'omi, seeing the Lord hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath sent me affliction?
008	RUT	001	022	So did Na'omi return, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who had returned out of the fields of Moab; and they came to Beth-lechem at the beginning of the barley-harvest.
008	RUT	002	001	And Na'omi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty, valiant man, of the family of Elimelech, whose name was Bo'az.
008	RUT	002	002	And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Na'omi, Let me go, I pray thee, into the field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose eyes I shall find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.
008	RUT	002	003	And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers; and the accident happened to her, that it was a part of the field belonging unto Bo'az, who was of the family of Elimelech.
008	RUT	002	004	And, behold, Bo'az came from Beth-lechem, and he said unto the reapers, The Lord be with you. And they said unto him, May the Lord bless thee.
008	RUT	002	005	Then said Bo'az unto his young man that was appointed over the reapers, Whose maiden is this?
008	RUT	002	006	And the young man that was appointed over the reapers answered and said, It is a Moabitish maiden that is returned with Na'omi out of the fields of Moab;
008	RUT	002	007	And she said, Let me glean, I pray you, and gather among the sheaves after the reapers: so she came, and hath remained ever from the morning even until now; it is but a little while that she hath sat down in the house.
008	RUT	002	008	Then said Bo'az unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go away from this; but keep close company with my own maidens.
008	RUT	002	009	Let thy eyes be on the field which they may reap, and go thou after them; behold, I have charged the young men that they shall not touch thee: and when thou art thirsty, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men may draw.
008	RUT	002	010	Thereupon she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thy eyes, that thou shouldst take cognizance of me, seeing I am but a stranger?
008	RUT	002	011	But Bo'az answered and said unto her, It hath fully been told me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law after the death of thy husband; and how thou hast forsaken thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy birth, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not yesterday or the day before.
008	RUT	002	012	May the Lord recompense thy work, and may thy reward be complete from the Lord the God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to seek shelter.
008	RUT	002	013	Then said she, Let me find grace in thy eyes, my lord; for thou hast comforted me, and because thou hast spoken [kindly] unto the heart of thy handmaid, though I be not like one of thy handmaids.
008	RUT	002	014	And Bo'az said unto her, At mealtime come near hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she seated herself beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she ate, and was satisfied, and had some left.
008	RUT	002	015	Then did she arise to glean: and Bo'az commanded his young men, saying, Even between the sheaves let her glean, and do not cause her to feel any shame;
008	RUT	002	016	And ye shall also draw out some for her from the bundles on purpose, and leave it, that she may glean it, and ye shall not rebuke her.
008	RUT	002	017	So she gleaned in the field until the evening; and when she beat out what she had gleaned, it was about an ephah of barley.
008	RUT	002	018	And she took it up, and she went into the city; and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned; and she brought forth and gave to her what she had left over after she was satisfied.
008	RUT	002	019	And her mother-in-law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned today? and where hast thou wrought? may he that took cognizance of thee be blessed. And she told her mother-in-law with whom she had wrought, and said, The name of the man with whom I wrought today is Bo'az.
008	RUT	002	020	Then said Na'omi unto her daughter-in-law, Blessed be he unto the Lord, who hath not withheld his kindness from the living and from the dead. And Na'omi said unto her, The man is nearly related unto us, he is one of our next kinsmen.
008	RUT	002	021	And Ruth the Moabitess said, He hath also said unto me, Thou shalt keep close company with my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.
008	RUT	002	022	Then said Na'omi unto Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, and that men may not meet with thee in any other field.
008	RUT	002	023	So she kept close company with the maidens of Bo'az in gleaning until the end of the barley-harvest and of the wheat-harvest; and she dwelt with her mother-in-law.
008	RUT	003	001	Then said Na'omi her mother-in-law unto her, My daughter, behold I will seek for thee a resting-place, where it may be well with thee.
008	RUT	003	002	And now, behold, Bo'az is our kinsman, he with whose maidens thou hast been. Lo, he is winnowing the barley to-night in the threshing-floor.
008	RUT	003	003	Therefore bathe, and anoint thyself, and put thy garments upon thee, and go down to the threshing-floor; [but] make thyself not known unto the man, until he shall have finished eating and drinking.
008	RUT	003	004	And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt note the place where he will lie, and thou shalt then go in, and lift up the covering that is on his feet, and lay thyself down: and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.
008	RUT	003	005	And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me will I do.
008	RUT	003	006	And she went down unto the threshing-floor, and did in accordance with all that her mother-in-law had commanded her.
008	RUT	003	007	And Bo'az ate and drank, and his heart became merry; and he then went in to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came in softly, and lifted up the covering that was on his feet, and laid herself down.
008	RUT	003	008	And it came to pass at midnight, that the man became terrified, and bent himself forward; and, behold, a woman was lying at his feet.
008	RUT	003	009	And he said, Who art thou? And she said, I am Ruth thy handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thy handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman.
008	RUT	003	010	And he said, Blessed be thou unto the Lord, my daughter; for thou hast shown more kindness in the last instance than the first, by not going after the young men, whether they be poor or rich.
008	RUT	003	011	And now, my daughter, fear not: all that thou mayest say will I do for thee; for all [the men in] the gate of my people know that thou art a virtuous woman.
008	RUT	003	012	And now, it is indeed true that I am thy near kinsman; nevertheless, there is a kinsman nearer than I.
008	RUT	003	013	Remain here this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will redeem thee, well, let him redeem; but if he be not willing to redeem thee, then will I redeem thee, as the Lord liveth: lie still until the morning.
008	RUT	003	014	And she lay at his feet until the morning; and she rose up before one could know another. And he said, It must not be known that this woman came into the threshing-floor.
008	RUT	003	015	Also he said, Bring hither the cloak that thou hast upon thee, and lay hold of it. And she laid hold of it, and he measured six [measures] of barley, and laid it on her, and went into the city.
008	RUT	003	016	And she came to her mother-in-law, and she said, How is it with thee, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.
008	RUT	003	017	And she said, These six measures of barley gave he unto me; for he said to me, Thou shalt not come empty to thy mother-in-law.
008	RUT	003	018	Then said she, Remain still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall out; for the man will not rest, until he have finished the matter this day.
008	RUT	004	001	But Bo'az went up to the gate, and sat down there; and, behold, the kinsman of whom Bo'az had spoken came passing by; and he said unto him, Turn aside hither, sit down here, such a one. And he turned aside, and sat down.
008	RUT	004	002	And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down.
008	RUT	004	003	And he said unto the kinsman, Na'omi, that is returned out of the field of Moab, hath to sell a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's.
008	RUT	004	004	And I thought to inform thee of it, saying, Buy it before those sitting here, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it; but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know; for there is none beside thee to redeem it, and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem it.
008	RUT	004	005	Then said Bo'az, On the day that thou buyest the field out of the hand of Na'omi, thou buyest it also from Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.
008	RUT	004	006	And the kinsman said, I am not able to redeem it for myself, lest I injure my own inheritance: redeem thou what I should redeem for thyself; for I am not able to redeem it.
008	RUT	004	007	Now this was formerly the custom in Israel at a redeeming and at an exchanging, to confirm any thing, that a man pulled off his shoe, and gave it to the other; and this was the manner of testimony in Israel.
008	RUT	004	008	Thereupon said the kinsman unto Bo'az, Buy it for thee. And he pulled off his shoe.
008	RUT	004	009	And Bo'az said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that belonged to Elimelech, and all that belonged to Kilyon and Machlon, out of the hand of Na'omi.
008	RUT	004	010	And also Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Machlon, have I obtained for myself as my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead may not be cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day.
008	RUT	004	011	And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, [We are] witnesses. The Lord grant that the woman that is coming into thy house be like Rachel and like Leah, who did both build up the house of Israel: and acquire thou wealth in Ephrathah, and let thy name become famous in Beth-lechem;
008	RUT	004	012	And may thy house be like the house of Perez, whom Thamar bore unto Judah, through the seed which the Lord will give thee of this young woman.
008	RUT	004	013	And Bo'az took Ruth, and she became his wife, and he went in unto her: and the Lord gave her conception, and she bore a son.
008	RUT	004	014	And the women said unto Na'omi, Blessed be the Lord, who hath not allowed to be wanting unto thee a kinsman this day: and may his name become famous in Israel.
008	RUT	004	015	And may he be unto thee one who refresheth thy soul, and who nourisheth thy old age; for thy daughter-in-law, who loveth thee, hath born him, she who is better to thee than seven sons.
008	RUT	004	016	And Na'omi took the child, and laid it in her lap, and she became a nurse unto it.
008	RUT	004	017	And the neighboring women gave him a name, saying, There hath been a son born unto Na'omi: and they called his name 'Obed, who is the father of Jesse, the father of David.
008	RUT	004	018	And these are the generations of Perez: Perez begat Chezron;
008	RUT	004	019	And Chezron begat Ram; and Ram begat 'Amminadab;
008	RUT	004	020	And 'Amminadab begat Nachshon; and Nachshon begat Salmah;
008	RUT	004	021	And Salmon begat Bo'az; and Bo'az begat 'Obed;
008	RUT	004	022	And 'Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.

# BOOK	009	1SA	1 Samuel	1 Samuel
009	1SA	001	001	And there was a certain man of Rama-thayim-zophim, of the mountain of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah, the son of Yerocham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tochu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite.
009	1SA	001	002	And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
009	1SA	001	003	And this man went up out of his city from year to year to prostrate himself and to sacrifice unto the Lord of hosts in Shiloh. And at that place were the two sons of 'Eli, Chophni and Phinehas, priests of the Lord.
009	1SA	001	004	And when the day was come that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions;
009	1SA	001	005	But unto Hannah he gave a double portion; for Hannah he loved [greatly]; but the Lord had shut up her womb.
009	1SA	001	006	And her rival also provoked her continually, in order to make her fret; because the Lord had shut up her womb.
009	1SA	001	007	And he did so year by year, as often as she went up to the house of the Lord, so did she provoke her; wherefore she wept, and did not eat.
009	1SA	001	008	Then said to her Elkanah her husband, Hannah, why wilt thou weep? and why wilt thou not eat? and why should thy heart be grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?
009	1SA	001	009	And Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk; and 'Eli the priest was sitting upon a chair by the door-post of the temple of the Lord.
009	1SA	001	010	But she had bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the Lord, and wept greatly.
009	1SA	001	011	And she vowed a vow, and said, O Lord of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thy handmaid, but wilt give unto thy handmaid a man-child: then will I give him unto the Lord all the days of his life, and no razor shall come upon his head.
009	1SA	001	012	And it came to pass, as she continued praying long before the Lord, that 'Eli watched her mouth.
009	1SA	001	013	Now as for Hannah, she spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice could not be heard; wherefore 'Eli regarded her as a drunken woman.
009	1SA	001	014	And 'Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from off thee.
009	1SA	001	015	And Hannah answered and said, No, my Lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit; but neither wine nor strong drink have I drunk, and I have poured out my soul before the Lord.
009	1SA	001	016	Esteem not thy handmaid as a worthless woman; for out of the abundance of my grief and vexation have I spoken hitherto.
009	1SA	001	017	Then 'Eli answered and said, Go in peace; and may the God of Israel grant thy petition which thou hast asked of him.
009	1SA	001	018	And she said, Let thy handmaid find grace in thy eyes. The woman then went on her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no longer as before.
009	1SA	001	019	And they rose up early in the morning, and prostrated themselves before the Lord, and returned, and came to their house at Ramah; and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the Lord remembered her.
009	1SA	001	020	And it came to pass, after the lapse of some time, that Hannah conceived, and bore a son; and she called his name Samuel, saying, Because from the Lord have I asked him.
009	1SA	001	021	And the man Elkanah went up, with all his house, to offer unto the Lord the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.
009	1SA	001	022	But Hannah did not go up; for she said unto her husband, So soon as the child shall be weaned, then I will bring him, that he may appear before the Lord, and abide there for ever.
009	1SA	001	023	And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth good in thy eyes; tarry until thou hast weaned him; only may the Lord fulfill his word. So the woman remained behind, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.
009	1SA	001	024	And she took him up with her, when she had weaned him, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and she brought him unto the house of the Lord at Shiloh; although the child was yet young.
009	1SA	001	025	And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to 'Eli.
009	1SA	001	026	And she said, Pardon, my Lord, as thy soul liveth, my Lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, to pray unto the Lord.
009	1SA	001	027	For this lad did I pray; and the Lord hath granted me my petition which I asked of him;
009	1SA	001	028	Therefore also have I lent him, for my part, to the Lord; all the days that have been assigned to him shall he be lent to the Lord. And he bowed himself there before the Lord.
009	1SA	002	001	And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart is glad in the Lord, my horn is exalted through the Lord: my mouth is enlarged over my enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.
009	1SA	002	002	There is none holy like the Lord; for there is none beside thee; and there is not any rock like our God.
009	1SA	002	003	Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogance come out of your mouth; for a God of knowledge is the Lord, and by him are actions weighed.
009	1SA	002	004	The bow of the mighty is broken, and those that stumbled are girded with strength.
009	1SA	002	005	They that were full hire themselves out for bread; and they that were hungry cease [from labor]: while the barren hath born seven, she that hath many children fadeth away.
009	1SA	002	006	The Lord killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.
009	1SA	002	007	The Lord maketh poor and maketh rich: he bringeth low and also lifteth up.
009	1SA	002	008	He raiseth up out of the dust the poor, from the dunghill he lifteth up the needy, to set them among nobles, and he assigneth them the throne of glory; for the Lord's are the pillars of the earth, on which he hath set the world.
009	1SA	002	009	He ever guardeth the feet of his pious ones, and the wicked shall be made silent in darkness; for not by strength can man prevail.
009	1SA	002	010	The Lord—his adversaries will be crushed; out of heaven will he thunder upon them: the Lord will judge the ends of the earth; and he will give strength unto his king, and lift up the horn of his anointed.
009	1SA	002	011	And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the lad was ministering unto the Lord before 'Eli the priest.
009	1SA	002	012	And the sons of 'Eli were worthless men: they knew not the Lord.
009	1SA	002	013	And the custom of the priests with the people was, that, when any man offered a sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while [the man] was seething the flesh, with a fork with three teeth in his hand;
009	1SA	002	014	And he struck it into the pan, or the kettle, or the caldron, or the pot; [and] all that the fork brought up the priest took away with it. So did they unto all the Israelites that came thither, to Shiloh.
009	1SA	002	015	Even before they had yet burnt the fat, the priest's servant would come, and say to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not take from thee sodden flesh, but raw.
009	1SA	002	016	And if the man said unto him, They will surely presently burn the fat, and then take whatever thy soul may long for: then would he say, No; but thou shalt give it me now; and if not, I will take it by force.
009	1SA	002	017	And the sin of the young men was very great before the Lord; for the men despised the offering of the Lord.
009	1SA	002	018	But Samuel was ministering before the Lord, being a lad, girded with a linen ephod.
009	1SA	002	019	Moreover his mother used to make him a little overcoat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.
009	1SA	002	020	And 'Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, May the Lord give thee seed from this woman instead of the loan who is lent to the Lord. And they went back unto his place.
009	1SA	002	021	And truly the Lord visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. And the lad Samuel grew up before the Lord.
009	1SA	002	022	Now 'Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons were in the habit of doing unto all Israel; and how they would lie with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
009	1SA	002	023	And he said unto them, Why will ye do such things? for I hear of your evil dealings from all this people.
009	1SA	002	024	No, my sons; for the report that I hear is not good, which the Lord's people spread abroad.
009	1SA	002	025	If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him; but if against the Lord a man should sin, who shall pray for him? Nevertheless would they not hearken unto the voice of their father, because the Lord desired to slay them.
009	1SA	002	026	And the lad Samuel was constantly growing and increasing in favor both with the Lord, and also with men.
009	1SA	002	027	And there came a man of God unto 'Eli, and said unto him, Thus hath said the Lord, Did I [not] appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt, in Pharaoh's house?
009	1SA	002	028	And did I [not] choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to me as a priest, to offer upon my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I [not] give unto the house of thy father all the fire-offerings of the children of Israel?
009	1SA	002	029	Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at my meat-offering, which I have commanded in [my] habitation? and [why] honoredst thou thy sons above me, to fatten yourselves with the first of every offering of Israel my people?
009	1SA	002	030	Therefore saith the Lord the God of Israel, I had indeed said, Thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever; but now, saith the Lord, Be it far from me; for those that honor me will I honor, and those that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.
009	1SA	002	031	Behold, days are coming, that I will hew off thy arm, and the arm of thy father's house, so that there shall not be an old man in thy house.
009	1SA	002	032	And thou shalt behold a rival in my habitation, in all that by which he will do good for Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thy house in all times.
009	1SA	002	033	And yet I will not cut off the men descended from thee from my altar, to consume thy eyes, and to grieve thy soul: and all the increase of thy house shall die as [vigorous] men.
009	1SA	002	034	And this shall be unto thee the sign, that shall happen on thy two sons, on Chophni and Phinehas: On one day shall they, both of them, die.
009	1SA	002	035	And I will raise up to me a faithful priest, who shall do in accordance with what is in my heart and in my mind; and I will build for him an enduring house; and he shall walk before my anointed in all times.
009	1SA	002	036	And it shall come to pass, that whoever is left in thy house shall come to bow down to him for a gera of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say, Attach me, I pray thee, unto one of the priestly offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.
009	1SA	003	001	And the lad Samuel was ministering unto the Lord before 'Eli. And the word of the Lord was scarce in those days: prophecy was not extended.
009	1SA	003	002	And it came to pass one day, when 'Eli was lying down in his place, and his eyes had begun to grow dim, he could not see;
009	1SA	003	003	And the lamp of God had not yet gone out, while Samuel was lying down in [the hall of] the temple of the Lord, where the ark of God was;
009	1SA	003	004	That the Lord called Samuel: and he said, Here am I.
009	1SA	003	005	And he ran unto 'Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he said, I did not call: lie down again. And he went and lay down.
009	1SA	003	006	And the Lord continued to call again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to 'Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I did not call, my son: lie down again.
009	1SA	003	007	And Samuel knew not yet the Lord, nor had the word of the Lord been as yet revealed unto him.
009	1SA	003	008	And the Lord continued to call, Samuel, the third time; and he arose and went to 'Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And 'Eli then perceived that the Lord was calling the lad.
009	1SA	003	009	And 'Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down; and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Lord; for thy servant heareth. And Samuel went and lay down in his place.
009	1SA	003	010	And the Lord came, and placed himself, and called as at previous times, Samuel, Samuel. And Samuel said, Speak; for thy servant heareth.
009	1SA	003	011	And the Lord said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.
009	1SA	003	012	On that day will I fulfill on 'Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house: I will begin and finish.
009	1SA	003	013	And I tell him that I will judge his house for ever; for the iniquity that he knew that his sons were drawing a curse on themselves, and he restrained them not.
009	1SA	003	014	And therefore have I sworn unto the house of 'Eli, that the iniquity of 'Eli's house shall not be atoned for with sacrifice or meat-offering for ever.
009	1SA	003	015	And Samuel lay until the morning, when he opened the doors of the house of the Lord; and Samuel feared to tell the vision unto 'Eli.
009	1SA	003	016	But 'Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he said, Here am I.
009	1SA	003	017	And he said, What is the word which he hath spoken unto thee? do not, I pray thee, conceal it from me: may God do to thee thus, and continue to do so, if thou conceal any thing from me of all the word that he hath spoken unto thee.
009	1SA	003	018	And Samuel told him all the words, and concealed nothing from him. And he said, He is the Lord: let him do what seemeth good in his eyes.
009	1SA	003	019	And Samuel grew up, and the Lord was with him, and he did not let fall any one of all his words to the ground.
009	1SA	003	020	And thus knew all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba' that Samuel was accredited as a prophet of the Lord.
009	1SA	003	021	And the Lord continued to appear in Shiloh; for the Lord revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the Lord.
009	1SA	004	001	And the word of Samuel became known to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Eben-ha'ezer; and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.
009	1SA	004	002	And the Philistines put themselves in battle-array against Israel; and the battle became general, and Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew on the battle-ground, in the field, about four thousand men.
009	1SA	004	003	And when the people were come back into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the Lord smitten us this day before the Philistines? Let us bring over to us out of Shiloh the ark of the covenant of the Lord, that it may come in the midst of us, and deliver us out of the hand of our enemies.
009	1SA	004	004	So the people sent to Shiloh, and they brought away from there the ark of the covenant of the Lord of hosts, who dwelleth over the cherubim: and the two sons of 'Eli, Chophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.
009	1SA	004	005	And it happened when the ark of the covenant of the Lord came into the camp, that all Israel set up a great shout, so that the earth trembled.
009	1SA	004	006	And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shouting, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shouting in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the Lord was come into the camp.
009	1SA	004	007	And the Philistines were afraid; for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for the like of this hath not been, yesterday or the day before.
009	1SA	004	008	Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with every plague in the wilderness.
009	1SA	004	009	Be strong, and act like men, O Philistines, so that ye become not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been servants to you: therefore act like men, and fight.
009	1SA	004	010	And the Philistines fought, and the Israelites were smitten, and they fled every man unto his tent: and the defeat was very great; and there fell of Israel thirty thousand men on foot.
009	1SA	004	011	And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of 'Eli, Chophni and Phinehas, died also.
009	1SA	004	012	And there ran a man of Benjamin from the battlefield, and came to Shiloh on the same day, with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head.
009	1SA	004	013	And when he came, lo, 'Eli was sitting upon a chair by the wayside watching; for his heart was anxious for the ark of God. And when the man came to tell it in the city, all the city cried out.
009	1SA	004	014	And when 'Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this multitude? And the man came in hastily, and told it to 'Eli.
009	1SA	004	015	Now 'Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were fixed, so that he could not see.
009	1SA	004	016	And the man said unto 'Eli, I am the person that came from the battlefield, and I myself fled from the battlefield today. And he said, What was it that took place, my son?
009	1SA	004	017	And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath also been a great slaughter among the people, and also thy two sons, Chophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God hath been taken.
009	1SA	004	018	And it came to pass, when he mentioned the ark of God, that he fell from off the chair backward by the side of the gate, and his neck was broken, and he died; for the man was old, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.
009	1SA	004	019	And his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings concerning that the ark of God had been taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she sank down and gave birth; for her pains came suddenly upon her.
009	1SA	004	020	And at the moment of her dying, the women that stood around her spoke [unto her], Fear not; for a son hast thou born. But she answered not, nor did she take it to heart.
009	1SA	004	021	And she named the child I-chabod, saying, Glory is departed from Israel; because of the taking away of the ark of God, and because of her father-in-law and her husband.
009	1SA	004	022	And she said, Glory is departed from Israel; for the ark of God hath been taken away.
009	1SA	005	001	And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Eben-ha'ezer unto Ashdod.
009	1SA	005	002	And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.
009	1SA	005	003	And when the people of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was lying upon his face on the earth before the ark of the Lord. And they took Dagon, and set him again in his place.
009	1SA	005	004	And when they arose early on the morning of the following day, behold, Dagon was lying upon his face on the ground before the ark of the Lord; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold; only the fish portion was left on him.
009	1SA	005	005	Therefore do the priests of Dagon, and all that come into Dagon's house, not step on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod even until this day.
009	1SA	005	006	And the hand of the Lord became heavy upon the people of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with hemorrhoids, even Ashdod and its territory.
009	1SA	005	007	And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not remain with us; for his hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our God.
009	1SA	005	008	And they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be removed unto Gath. And they removed the ark of the God of Israel thither.
009	1SA	005	009	And it happened, after they had removed it, that the hand of the Lord was against the city with a very great confusion; and he smote the men of the city, both small and great, and they had hemorrhoids in their secret parts.
009	1SA	005	010	And they sent away the ark of God to 'Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to 'Ekron, that the 'Ekronites cried out, saying, They have removed to us the ark of the God of Israel, to slay us and our people.
009	1SA	005	011	So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, that it may return to its own place, so that it may not slay us, and our people; for there was a confusion of death throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.
009	1SA	005	012	And the people that did not die were smitten with the hemorrhoids; and the lamentation of the city went up to heaven.
009	1SA	006	001	And the ark of the Lord was in the fields of the Philistines seven months.
009	1SA	006	002	And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do with the ark of the Lord? let us know wherewith we shall send off it to its place.
009	1SA	006	003	And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not away empty; but ye must to a certainty return him a trespass-offering: then will ye be healed, and it will be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.
009	1SA	006	004	And they said, What shall be the trespass-offering that we shall return to him? And they answered, According to the number of the lords of the Philistines, five golden hemorrhoids, and five golden mice; for one plague affected them all, and your lords.
009	1SA	006	005	Therefore make images of your hemorrhoids, and images of your mice that devastate the land; and give glory unto the God of Israel: perhaps he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.
009	1SA	006	006	And why will ye harden your heart, just as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their heart? Did not they, when he had wrought wonderful deeds among them, dismiss them, and they departed?
009	1SA	006	007	And now make a new wagon, and take two milch-cows, on which there hath come no yoke, and harness the cows to the wagon, and bring their calves home away from them:
009	1SA	006	008	And take the ark of the Lord, and place it into the wagon; and the articles of gold, which ye return him as a trespass-offering, ye must put in a casket alongside of it; and then send it away, that it may go.
009	1SA	006	009	And then see, if it go up by the way to its own boundary, to Beth-shemesh, then hath he done us this great evil; but if not, then shall we know that not his hand hath smitten us; it is a chance which hath happened to us.
009	1SA	006	010	And the men did so; and they took two milch-cows, and harnessed them to the wagon, and their calves they shut up at home:
009	1SA	006	011	And they placed the ark of the Lord in the wagon, and the casket with the mice of gold and images of their hemorrhoids.
009	1SA	006	012	And the cows went straight forward on the way on the road to Beth-shemesh: on one highway they did go along, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them as far as the border of Beth-shemesh.
009	1SA	006	013	And they of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley; and when they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, they rejoiced to see it.
009	1SA	006	014	And the wagon came to the field of Joshua, the Beth-shemite, and stood still there; and there was a great stone; and they split the wood of the wagon, and the cows they offered as a burnt-offering unto the Lord.
009	1SA	006	015	And the Levites took down the ark of the Lord, and the casket that was with it, wherein were the articles of gold, and put them on the great stone; and the men of Beth-shemesh offered bunt-offerings and sacrificed sacrifices on the same day unto the Lord.
009	1SA	006	016	And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to 'Ekron on the same day.
009	1SA	006	017	And these are the golden hemorrhoids which the Philistines returned as a trespass-offering unto the Lord: For Ashdod one, for Gazzah one, for Ashkelon one, for Gath one, for 'Ekron one.
009	1SA	006	018	And the golden mice were according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines under the five lords, from the fortified city, down to the open village, even unto the great stone whereon they had set down the ark of the Lord, and which is unto this day in the field of Joshua, the Beth-shemite.
009	1SA	006	019	And he smote among the men of Beth-shemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the Lord, namely, he smote among the people seventy men and fifty thousand men: and the people mourned because the Lord had caused among the people a great slaughter.
009	1SA	006	020	And the men of Beth-shemesh said, Who is able to stand before the Lord, this holy God? and to whom shall it go up away from us?
009	1SA	006	021	And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiryath-ye'arim, saying, The Philistines have brought back the ark of the Lord: come ye down, and fetch it up to you.
009	1SA	007	001	And the men of Kiryath-ye'arim came, and fetched up the ark of the Lord, and brought it unto the house of Abinadab on the hill, and Elazar his son they sanctified to guard the ark of the Lord.
009	1SA	007	002	And it came to pass, from the time the ark remained in Kiryath-ye'arim, and the time was long, and it was twenty years: that all the house of Israel followed anxiously after the Lord.
009	1SA	007	003	And Samuel said unto all the house of Israel, as followeth, If with all your heart ye do return unto the Lord, then put away the gods of the stranger and the 'Ashtaroth from your midst, and direct your heart unto the Lord, and serve him alone: and then will he deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.
009	1SA	007	004	Then did the children of Israel put away the Be'alim and the 'Ashtaroth, and served the Lord alone.
009	1SA	007	005	And Samuel said, Assemble all Israel together at Mizpah, and I will pray in your behalf unto the Lord.
009	1SA	007	006	And they assembled themselves together at Mizpah, and drew water, and poured it out before the Lord, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against the Lord. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpah.
009	1SA	007	007	And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel had assembled themselves at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.
009	1SA	007	008	And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Do not abstain, so as not to cry for us unto the Lord our God, that he may help us out of the hand of the Philistines.
009	1SA	007	009	And Samuel took one sucking lamb, and offered it for an entire burnt-offering unto the Lord: and Samuel cried unto the Lord in behalf of Israel; and the Lord answered him.
009	1SA	007	010	And as Samuel was offering up the burnt-offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel; but the Lord thundered with a loud noise on that day over the Philistines, and brought them into confusion, and they were smitten before Israel.
009	1SA	007	011	And the men of Israel went out of Mizpah, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, as far as below Beth-car.
009	1SA	007	012	And Samuel took one stone, and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and called its name Eben-ha'ezer, saying, As far as this hath the Lord helped us.
009	1SA	007	013	So were the Philistines humbled, and they came no more into the territory of Israel; and the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
009	1SA	007	014	And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel came again to Israel, from 'Ekron even unto Gath, and their territory did Israel deliver out of the hand of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Emorites.
009	1SA	007	015	And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
009	1SA	007	016	And he went from year to year and traveled in circuit to Beth-el, and Gilgal, and Mizpah, and judged Israel in all these places.
009	1SA	007	017	And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there he judged Israel: and he built there an altar unto the Lord.
009	1SA	008	001	And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he appointed his sons judges over Israel.
009	1SA	008	002	And the name of his first-born was Joel; and the name of his second Abiyah: they judged in Beer-sheba'.
009	1SA	008	003	But his sons walked not in his ways, and they inclined after their own advantage, and took bribes, and perverted justice.
009	1SA	008	004	Then did all the elders of Israel assemble themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah,
009	1SA	008	005	And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons have not walked in thy ways: now appoint for us a king to judge us like all the nations.
009	1SA	008	006	But the thing was displeasing in the eyes of Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the Lord.
009	1SA	008	007	And the Lord said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they may say unto thee; for not thee have they rejected, but me have they rejected, that I should not reign over them.
009	1SA	008	008	In accordance with all the deeds which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even until this day, when they forsook me, and served other gods: so do they also unto thee.
009	1SA	008	009	And now hearken unto their voice: nevertheless thou must still solemnly forewarn them, and tell them the manner of the king that will reign over them.
009	1SA	008	010	And Samuel said all the words of the Lord unto the people that had asked of him a king.
009	1SA	008	011	And he said, This will be the manner of the king that will reign over you: Your sons will he take, and appoint them for himself with his chariots, and among his horsemen; and they will have to run before his chariot;
009	1SA	008	012	And to appoint for himself captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and to plough his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and the instruments of his chariots.
009	1SA	008	013	And your daughters will he take for ointment makers, and for cooks, and for bakers.
009	1SA	008	014	And your fields, and your vineyards, and your olive-yards, yea the best, will he take, and give them to his servants.
009	1SA	008	015	And of your seeds, and of your vineyards will he take the tenth, and give [the same] to his officers, and to his servants.
009	1SA	008	016	And your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and your best young men, and your asses will he take, and employ [them] for his work.
009	1SA	008	017	Of your flocks will he take the tenth: and ye yourselves will become his servants.
009	1SA	008	018	And ye will cry out on that day because of your king whom ye will have chosen for yourselves, but the Lord will not answer you on that day.
009	1SA	008	019	Nevertheless the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel; and they said, No; but a king shall be over us;
009	1SA	008	020	That we also may ourselves be like all the nations: and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.
009	1SA	008	021	And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he spoke them before the ears of the Lord.
009	1SA	008	022	And the Lord said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and appoint them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city.
009	1SA	009	001	Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiach, the son of a Benjamite, a mighty man of valor.
009	1SA	009	002	And he had a son whose name was Saul, young and handsome; and there was not a man among the children of Israel handsomer than he: from his shoulders and upward he was taller than any of the people.
009	1SA	009	003	And there were lost the asses belonging to Kish, Saul's father; and Kish said to Saul his son, Do take with thee one of the servants, and arise, go seek the asses.
009	1SA	009	004	And he passed through the mountain of Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found [them] not; then they passed through the land of Sha'alim, and there was nothing there; and he passed through the land of Benjamin, but they found them not.
009	1SA	009	005	When they were come in the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father relinquish the care for the asses, and become anxious for us.
009	1SA	009	006	And the other said unto him, Behold now, a man of God is in this city, and the man is honored; all that he ever saith will surely come to pass: now let us go thither; perhaps he can tell us our way that we should go.
009	1SA	009	007	Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we should go, what shall we bring to the man? for the bread is spent out of our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we with us?
009	1SA	009	008	And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here in my hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver; and I will give this to the man of God, that he may tell us our way.
009	1SA	009	009	In former times it was custom in Israel, that when a man went to inquire of God, he said thus, Come, and let us go as far as the seer; for the Prophet of the present day was in former times called a Seer.
009	1SA	009	010	Then said Saul to his servant, Thy word is good: come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God was.
009	1SA	009	011	As they went up the ascent to the city, they found some maidens going out to draw water; and they said unto them, Is the seer here?
009	1SA	009	012	And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before you: make haste now, for this day came he to the city; because the people have a sacrifice today on the high-place;
009	1SA	009	013	As soon as ye are come into the city, ye will straightway find him, before yet he can go up to the high-place to eat; for the people will not eat until he be come, because he always blesseth the sacrifice; afterward eat those that are invited; and now go you up; for just today will ye surely find him.
009	1SA	009	014	And they went up into the city. They were entering into the city, when, behold, Samuel came out toward them, to go up to the high-place.
009	1SA	009	015	And the Lord had revealed to Samuel's ear one day before Saul's coming, saying,
009	1SA	009	016	About this time tomorrow will I send unto thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him as chief over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines; for I have beheld my people, because their cry is come unto me.
009	1SA	009	017	And when Samuel saw Saul, the Lord addressed him, Behold, the man of whom I spoke to thee, This one shall rule over my people.
009	1SA	009	018	And Saul drew near to Samuel within the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where is the house of the seer.
009	1SA	009	019	And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up before me unto the high-place, and ye shall eat with me today; and I will let thee go in the morning, and all that is in thy heart will I tell thee.
009	1SA	009	020	And as for thy asses that were lost unto thee this day three days ago, do not set thy heart on them; for they have been found. And to whom belongeth all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not to thee, and to all thy father's house?
009	1SA	009	021	And Saul answered and said, Am not I a son of Benjamin, of one of the smallest tribes of Israel? and [is not] my family the least of all the families of the tribes of Benjamin? wherefore then hast thou spoken to me such thing?
009	1SA	009	022	And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the apartment; and he assigned them a place at the head of the invited guests, who were about thirty persons.
009	1SA	009	023	And Samuel said unto the cook, Hand here the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Put it away by thee.
009	1SA	009	024	And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was on it, and set it before Saul; and he said, Behold what is left! set it before thee, and eat; for unto this time hath it been kept from thee, since I said, I have invited the people. And Saul ate with Samuel on that day.
009	1SA	009	025	And they went down from the high-place into the city, and he spoke with Saul upon the roof.
009	1SA	009	026	And they got up early; and it came to pass when the morning-dawn arose, that Samuel called Saul to the roof, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out, both of them, he and Samuel, into the street.
009	1SA	009	027	As they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Say to the servant that he pass on before us, —and he passed on, —but thou remain standing a while, and I will let thee hear the word of God.
009	1SA	010	001	And Samuel took a flask of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Behold, it is because the Lord hath anointed thee over his inheritance as chief.
009	1SA	010	002	When thou goest this day away from me, thou wilt find two men who are now by Rachel's sepulchre, on the boundary of Benjamin at Zelzach; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath given up the matter of the asses, and is anxious for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?
009	1SA	010	003	Then shalt thou go on forward from there, and thou shalt come as far as the grove of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Beth-el, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:
009	1SA	010	004	And they will ask thee after thy welfare, and give thee two loaves of bread, which thou must take from their hand.
009	1SA	010	005	After that shalt thou come to the hill of God, where the outposts of the Philistines are; and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou wilt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high-place, having before them a psaltery, and a tambourine, and a pipe, and a harp; and they will be prophesying;
009	1SA	010	006	And the Spirit of the Lord will suddenly come over thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and thou shalt be changed into another man.
009	1SA	010	007	And it shall be, that, when these signs are come unto thee, then do thou what thy hand may be able to effect; for God is with thee.
009	1SA	010	008	And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt-offerings, [and] to sacrifice sacrifices of peace-offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and then will I tell thee what thou shalt do.
009	1SA	010	009	And it happened, that, as he turned his back to go away from Samuel, God changed his heart into another; and all these signs came to pass on that same day.
009	1SA	010	010	And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came suddenly over him, and he prophesied in the midst of them.
009	1SA	010	011	And it came to pass, when all that knew him before saw, that, behold, he prophesied with the prophets, then said the people one to another, What is this that hath happened to the son of Kish? is Saul also among the prophets?
009	1SA	010	012	And one of that place answered and said, And who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?
009	1SA	010	013	And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high-place.
009	1SA	010	014	And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither were ye gone? And he said, To seek the asses; and when we saw that they were nowhere, we went to Samuel.
009	1SA	010	015	And Saul's uncle said, Do tell me, I pray thee, what did Samuel say unto you.
009	1SA	010	016	And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses had been found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel had spoken, he told him not.
009	1SA	010	017	And Samuel called the people together unto the Lord to Mizpah;
009	1SA	010	018	And he said unto the children of Israel, Thus hath said the Lord the God of Israel, I brought up Israel from Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you;
009	1SA	010	019	And ye for your part have this day rejected your God, he who hath saved you out of all your misfortunes and your tribulations; and ye have said unto him, Nevertheless, thou must set a king over us: and now present yourselves before the Lord according to your tribes, and according to your thousands.
009	1SA	010	020	And Samuel caused all the tribes of Israel to come near; and the tribe of Benjamin was seized.
009	1SA	010	021	And he caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near according to its families, and the family of Matri was seized, and then was seized Saul the son of Kish: and they sought him, but he could not be found.
009	1SA	010	022	And they inquired again of the Lord, Is the man yet come hither? And the Lord said, Behold, he hath hidden himself among the vessels.
009	1SA	010	023	And they ran and fetched him thence, and he placed himself erect in the midst of the people, and he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.
009	1SA	010	024	And Samuel said to all the people, Have ye seen him whom the Lord hath made choice of, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, Long live the king.
009	1SA	010	025	Then did Samuel speak to the people the rights of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it down before the Lord. And Samuel sent away all the people, every man to his house.
009	1SA	010	026	And Saul also went to his home to Gib'ah; and there went with him a large crowd, whose heart God had touched.
009	1SA	010	027	But the worthless men said, In what can this help us? And they despised him, and brought him no present. But he acted as though he were deaf.
009	1SA	011	001	Then came up Nachash the 'Ammonite, and encamped against Yabesh-gil'ad: and all the men of Yabesh said unto Nachash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.
009	1SA	011	002	And Nachash the 'Ammonite said unto them, On this condition will I make it with you, that ye all have put out the right eye, that I may lay it as a reproach upon all Israel.
009	1SA	011	003	And the elders of Yabesh said unto him, Grant us seven days' respite, that we may send messengers throughout all the boundary of Israel; and then, if there be none to save us, will we come out to thee.
009	1SA	011	004	And the messengers came to Gib'ah of Saul, and spoke the words in the ears of the people; and all the people lifted up their voice, and wept.
009	1SA	011	005	And, behold, Saul was coming after the herds out of the field; and Saul said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they told him the words of the men of Yabesh.
009	1SA	011	006	And the spirit of God came suddenly over Saul when he heard these words, and his anger was kindled greatly,
009	1SA	011	007	And he took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them about throughout all the boundary of Israel by the hand of the messengers, saying, Whosoever goeth not forth after Saul and after Samuel, shall have his herds thus treated. And the dread of the Lord fell on the people, and they went out as one man.
009	1SA	011	008	And he numbered them in Bezek; and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.
009	1SA	011	009	And they said unto the messengers that were come, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Yabesh-gil'ad, Tomorrow shall ye have help, when the sun shineth hot. And the messengers came and told it to the men of Yabesh; and these were glad.
009	1SA	011	010	And the men of Yabesh said, Tomorrow will we go out unto you, and ye can do unto us in accordance with all that seemeth good in your eyes.
009	1SA	011	011	And it happened on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and they smote the 'Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that those that remained were scattered, and no two among them were left together.
009	1SA	011	012	And the people said unto Samuel, Who is there that saith, Shall Saul reign over us? give up the men, and we will put them to death.
009	1SA	011	013	And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death on this day; for today the Lord hath wrought deliverance in Israel.
009	1SA	011	014	And Samuel said to the people, Come and let us go to Gilgal, and renew there the choice of the king.
009	1SA	011	015	And all the people went to Gilgal; and they appointed there Saul as king before the Lord in Gilgal; and they sacrificed there sacrifices of peace-offerings before the Lord; and Saul with all the men of Israel rejoiced there very greatly.
009	1SA	012	001	And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me, and I have set a king over you.
009	1SA	012	002	And now, behold, the king is walking before you; and I am old and gray-headed; and my sons, behold, they are with you; and I have walked before you from my youth even until this day.
009	1SA	012	003	Behold, here am I; testify against me in the presence of the Lord, and in the presence of his anointed: Whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or from whose hand have I received any ransom so that I withdrew my eyes from him? and I will restore it you.
009	1SA	012	004	And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor hast thou oppressed us, and thou hast not taken from any man's hand the least.
009	1SA	012	005	And he said unto them, The Lord is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found in my hand the least: and they answered, He is witness.
009	1SA	012	006	And Samuel said unto the people, It is the Lord who did [wonders through] Moses and Aaron, and who brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.
009	1SA	012	007	And now stand up, that I may hold judgment with you before the Lord concerning all the benefits of the Lord, which he hath done to you and to your fathers.
009	1SA	012	008	When Jacob was come into Egypt, then did your fathers cry unto the Lord, and the Lord sent Moses and Aaron, and they brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and caused them to dwell in this place.
009	1SA	012	009	And when they forgot the Lord their God, he sold them into the hand of Sissera, the chief of the host of Chazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they made war against them.
009	1SA	012	010	And they cried [then] unto the Lord, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the Lord, and have served the Be'alim and the 'Ashtaroth; and now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.
009	1SA	012	011	And the Lord sent Yerubba'al, and Bedan, and Yiphthach, and Samuel, and he delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, so that ye dwelt safely.
009	1SA	012	012	But when ye saw that Nachash the king of the children of 'Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, No; but a king shall reign over us: when the Lord your God is your king.
009	1SA	012	013	And now here is the king whom ye have chosen, whom ye have asked for! and, behold, the Lord hath set over you a king.
009	1SA	012	014	If ye will fear the Lord, and serve him, and obey his voice, and will not rebel against the will of the Lord: then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the Lord your God.
009	1SA	012	015	But if ye will not hearken to the voice of the Lord, and rebel against the will of the Lord: then will the hand of the Lord be against you, as it was against your fathers.
009	1SA	012	016	And now stand up and see this great thing, which the Lord is about doing before your eyes.
009	1SA	012	017	Is there not wheat-harvest today? I will call unto the Lord, and he will send thunders and rain; and ye will [thus] perceive and see that your wickedness is great, which ye have done, in the eyes of the Lord, to ask for yourselves a king.
009	1SA	012	018	And Samuel called unto the Lord; and the Lord sent thunders and rain on that day: and all the people feared greatly the Lord and Samuel.
009	1SA	012	019	And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray in behalf of thy servants unto the Lord thy God, that we may not die; for we have added unto all our sins yet this evil, to ask for ourselves a king.
009	1SA	012	020	And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not; ye have indeed done all this evil: yet turn not aside from following the Lord, and serve ye the Lord with all your heart;
009	1SA	012	021	And turn ye not aside; for then would ye go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; because they are vain.
009	1SA	012	022	For the Lord will not forsake his people for the sake of his great name; because it hath pleased the Lord to make you a people unto himself.
009	1SA	012	023	Moreover as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the Lord by ceasing to pray in behalf of you; but I will teach you the good and the right way:
009	1SA	012	024	Only fear the Lord, and serve him in truth with all your heart; for see what great things he hath done with you.
009	1SA	012	025	But if ye will in any wise do wickedly, both ye yourselves as also your king shall perish.
009	1SA	013	001	When Saul had reigned one year, —and two years he reigned over Israel, —
009	1SA	013	002	Saul chose for himself three thousand men out of Israel; and there were with Saul two thousand in Michmash and on the mountain of Beth-el, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gib'ah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent away every man to his tents.
009	1SA	013	003	And Jonathan smote the outpost of the Philistines that was at Geba', and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the cornet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear it.
009	1SA	013	004	And all Israel heard it, saying, Saul hath smitten the outpost of the Philistines, and the Israelites also have put themselves in ill-favor with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.
009	1SA	013	005	And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea-shore in multitude; and they came up, and encamped in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.
009	1SA	013	006	And when the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, [for the people were oppressed,] then did the people hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in strongholds, and in pits.
009	1SA	013	007	And some of the Hebrews passed over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gil'ad. As for Saul, he was still in Gilgal, and all the people followed him hastily.
009	1SA	013	008	And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed; but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattering themselves from him.
009	1SA	013	009	And Saul said, Bring hither to me the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings. And he offered the burnt-offering.
009	1SA	013	010	And it came to pass, that, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might greet him.
009	1SA	013	011	And Samuel said, What hast thou done: And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattering themselves from me, whereas thou camest not at the appointed day, and the Philistines are gathering themselves together at Michmash;
009	1SA	013	012	And I said, The Philistines will now come down unto me to Gilgal, and I have not yet made supplication unto the Lord: wherefore I forced myself, and offered the burnt-offering.
009	1SA	013	013	And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the Lord thy God, which he had commanded thee; for now would the Lord have established thy government over Israel for ever.
009	1SA	013	014	But now thy government shall not endure: the Lord hath sought out for himself a man after his own heart, and the Lord hath ordained him to be chief over his people; because thou hast not kept what the Lord had commanded thee.
009	1SA	013	015	And Samuel arose, and went up from Gilgal unto Gib'ah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were to be found with him, about six hundred men.
009	1SA	013	016	And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were to be found with them, were lying in Geba' of Benjamin; but the Philistines were encamped in Michmash.
009	1SA	013	017	And the troop of freebooters went out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned into the way to 'Ophrah, unto the land of Shu'al;
009	1SA	013	018	And another company turned into the way to Beth-choron; and the other company turned into the way to the frontier that looketh over the valley of Zebo'im toward the wilderness.
009	1SA	013	019	Now there was no smith to be found throughout all the land of Israel; for the Philistines said, So that the Hebrews shall not make themselves swords or spears.
009	1SA	013	020	But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his plough-share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.
009	1SA	013	021	And they used a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the three-pronged forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.
009	1SA	013	022	So it came to pass on the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan; but they were found with Saul and with Jonathan his son.
009	1SA	013	023	And the outpost of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.
009	1SA	014	001	Now it happened one day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bore his armor, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' outpost, that is on the other side yonder. But unto his father he told nothing.
009	1SA	014	002	And Saul tarried in the lower part of Gib'ah under the pomegranate tree which is by Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men.
009	1SA	014	003	And Achiyah, the son of Achitub, the brother of I-chabod, the son of Phinehas, the son of 'Eli, the priest of the Lord in Shiloh, wore the ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.
009	1SA	014	004	And between the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the outpost of the Philistines, there was a sharp point of rock on the one side, and a sharp point of rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.
009	1SA	014	005	The one point rose up abruptly northward opposite Michmash, and the other southward opposite Geba'.
009	1SA	014	006	And Jonathan said to the young man that bore his armor, Come, and let us go over unto the outpost of these uncircumcised: it may be that the Lord will work for us; for there is no restraint to the Lord to save by means of many or by means of few.
009	1SA	014	007	And his armor-bearer said unto him, Do all that is in thy heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.
009	1SA	014	008	Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we will show ourselves unto them.
009	1SA	014	009	If they say thus unto us, Stand still until we come to you: then will we remain standing in our places, and will not go up unto them.
009	1SA	014	010	But if they say thus, Come up unto us: then will we go up; for the Lord hath delivered them into our hand; and this shall be unto us the sign.
009	1SA	014	011	And when both of them showed themselves unto the outpost of the Philistines, the Philistines said, Behold, Hebrews are coming forth out of the holes wherein they have hidden themselves.
009	1SA	014	012	And the men of the outpost addressed Jonathan and his armor-bearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will let you know something. Then said Jonathan unto his armor-bearer, Come up after me; for the Lord hath given them up into the hand of Israel.
009	1SA	014	013	And Jonathan then ascended upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armor-bearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer was killing after him.
009	1SA	014	014	And that first defeat, which Jonathan and his armor-bearer caused, was about twenty men, within about the half of a field, which a yoke of oxen might plough.
009	1SA	014	015	And there arose a terror in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the outposts, and the free-booters, they also were terrified, and the earth quaked; and it became a very great terror.
009	1SA	014	016	And the watchers of Saul in Gib'ah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude became scattered, and ran hither and thither.
009	1SA	014	017	Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Muster now, and see who is gone away from us. And they mustered, and, behold, there was neither Jonathan nor his armor-bearer.
009	1SA	014	018	And Saul said unto Achiyah, Bring hither the ark of God; for the ark of God was on that day with the children of Israel.
009	1SA	014	019	And it happened, while Saul was speaking unto the priest, that the confusion which was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased more and more: And Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thy hand.
009	1SA	014	020	And Saul and all the people that were with him were called together, and they came to the battle; and, behold, the sword of every man was against his fellow, the disorder being very great.
009	1SA	014	021	And the Hebrews that were with the Philistines as before that time, those namely who had gone up with them, were in the camp round about; but these also resolved to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.
009	1SA	014	022	And all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves on the mountain of Ephraim, heard that the Philistines had fled; and they also followed hard after them in the battle.
009	1SA	014	023	So the Lord saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto Beth-aven.
009	1SA	014	024	And the men of Israel were hard urged that day; and Saul adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that will eat food until the evening, until I have been avenged on my enemies. And the whole people tasted thus no food.
009	1SA	014	025	And [the men of] all the land came to a forest; and there was honey upon the surface of the field.
009	1SA	014	026	And when the people were come into the forest, behold, there was a stream of honey; but no one put his hand to his mouth; for the people feared the oath.
009	1SA	014	027	But Jonathan had not heard his father charging the people with the oath; he therefore put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and dipped it in a honey-comb, and carried his hand again to his mouth; and his eyes became clear.
009	1SA	014	028	Then commenced one of the people, and said, Thy father strictly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that will eat food this day; though the people were faint.
009	1SA	014	029	Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how my eyes become clear, because I have tasted a little of this honey.
009	1SA	014	030	How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely this day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for would there not have been now a greater defeat among the Philistines?
009	1SA	014	031	And they smote on that day among the Philistines from Michmash to Ayalon; and the people were very faint.
009	1SA	014	032	And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and young steers, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat upon the blood.
009	1SA	014	033	And they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people are sinning against the Lord, in eating upon the blood. And he [then] said, Ye have acted treacherously: roll [hither] unto me this day a great stone.
009	1SA	014	034	And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring near unto me every man his ox, and every man his lamb, and slaughter here, and eat; and sin not against the Lord in eating by the blood. And all the people brought near every man his ox by his hand that night, and slaughtered [them] there.
009	1SA	014	035	And Saul built an altar unto the Lord: the same was the first altar that he built unto the Lord.
009	1SA	014	036	And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning-light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good in thy eyes. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.
009	1SA	014	037	And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not on that day.
009	1SA	014	038	And Saul said, Draw ye near hither all the chief of the people: and know and see through what this sin hath happened this day.
009	1SA	014	039	For, as the Lord liveth, who saveth Israel, that if it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But no one answered him among all the people.
009	1SA	014	040	Then said he unto all Israel, Ye shall be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good in thy eyes.
009	1SA	014	041	And Saul said unto the Lord, God of Israel, O, show forth the perfect truth. And Jonathan and Saul were seized; but the people came forth [free].
009	1SA	014	042	And Saul said, Cast the lot between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was seized.
009	1SA	014	043	Then said Saul to Jonathan, Do tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste with the end of the staff that was in my hand a little honey: lo, I am willing to die.
009	1SA	014	044	And Saul said, May God do thus now, and in future also; for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.
009	1SA	014	045	And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? This shall not be: as the Lord liveth, there shall not fall one hair of his head to the ground; for with God hath he wrought this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, and he died not.
009	1SA	014	046	Then went Saul up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place.
009	1SA	014	047	So Saul strengthened himself in the government over Israel; and he fought on every side against all his enemies, against Moab, and against the children of 'Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he caused terror.
009	1SA	014	048	And he gathered an army, and he smote the 'Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of those that spoiled them.
009	1SA	014	049	Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Yishvi, and Malkishua': and the names of his two daughters—the name of the first-born was Merab, and the name of the younger Michal.
009	1SA	014	050	And the name of Saul's wife was Achino'am, the daughter of Achima'az: and the name of the captain of his army was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.
009	1SA	014	051	And Kish the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner, were each the son of Abiel.
009	1SA	014	052	And the war against the Philistines was violent all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto himself.
009	1SA	015	001	And Samuel said unto Saul, Me did the Lord send to anoint thee as king over his people, over Israel; and now hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the Lord.
009	1SA	015	002	Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, I remember what Amalek did to Israel, how he lay in wait for him on the way, when he came up from Egypt.
009	1SA	015	003	Now go and smite 'Amalek, and devote all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and lamb, camel and ass.
009	1SA	015	004	And Saul ordered the people to assemble, and he numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand men on foot, and ten thousand of the men of Judah.
009	1SA	015	005	And Saul came to the city of 'Amalek, and he fought in the valley.
009	1SA	015	006	And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from the midst of the 'Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; whereas ye acted kindly with all the children of Israel, at their coming up out of Egypt. And the Kenites departed from the midst of the 'Amalekites.
009	1SA	015	007	And Saul smote the 'Amalekites from Chavilah until thou comest to Shur, that is before Egypt.
009	1SA	015	008	And he caught Agag the king of the 'Amalekites alive, and all the people he devoted to the edge of the sword.
009	1SA	015	009	But Saul together with the people had pity on Agag, and on the best of the flocks, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the fat lambs, and all that was good, and they would not destroy them; but all the cattle that was of little value and weak, that they destroyed.
009	1SA	015	010	And the word of the Lord came unto Samuel, saying,
009	1SA	015	011	I repent that I have set up Saul as king; for he hath turned back from following me, and my word hath he not performed: and it displeased Samuel, and he cried unto the Lord all the night.
009	1SA	015	012	And Samuel rose up early to meet Saul in the morning; and it was told to Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set himself up a monument, and then went about, and passed on, and went down to Gilgal.
009	1SA	015	013	And Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou unto the Lord, I have performed the word of the Lord.
009	1SA	015	014	And Samuel said, What is then this bleating of the flocks in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?
009	1SA	015	015	And Saul said, From the 'Amalekites have they brought them; because the people had pity on the best of the flocks and of the oxen, in order to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God; and the rest have we destroyed.
009	1SA	015	016	And Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the Lord said to me this night: and he said unto him, Speak.
009	1SA	015	017	And Samuel said, Is it not that, however little thou wast in thy own eyes, thou art the head of the tribes of Israel? and the Lord anointed thee as king over Israel?
009	1SA	015	018	And the Lord sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and destroy the sinners, the 'Amalekites, and thou shalt fight against them until they be consumed.
009	1SA	015	019	Wherefore then didst thou not hearken unto the voice of the Lord, and didst fly upon the spoil, and didst the evil in the eyes of the Lord?
009	1SA	015	020	And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have fully hearkened unto the voice of the Lord; and I went on the way which the Lord had sent me; and I have brought Agag the king of 'Amalek; and the 'Amalekites have I destroyed.
009	1SA	015	021	And the people took of the spoil, of the flocks and oxen, the chief of the devoted things, to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in Gilgal.
009	1SA	015	022	And Samuel said, Hath the Lord as much delight in burnt-offerings and in sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to attend more than the fat of the rams.
009	1SA	015	023	For the sin of witchcraft is rebellion, and idolatry and image-worship, stubbornness; inasmuch as thou hast despised the word of the Lord, he hath also despised thee that thou shalt not be king.
009	1SA	015	024	And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned; for I have transgressed the will of the Lord, and thy words; because I feared the people, and I hearkened to their voice.
009	1SA	015	025	And now, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and return with me, that I may prostrate myself to the Lord.
009	1SA	015	026	And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee; for thou didst despise the word of the Lord, and the Lord hath despised thee, that thou shalt not be king over Israel.
009	1SA	015	027	And Samuel turned about to go: and he laid hold on the corner of his mantle, and it was rent.
009	1SA	015	028	And Samuel said unto him, The Lord hath rent the kingdom of Israel from off thee this day, and hath given it to thy associate, who is better than thou.
009	1SA	015	029	And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent; for he is not a man, that he should repent.
009	1SA	015	030	And he said, I have sinned; [yet] honor me now, I pray thee, in the presence of the elders of my people, and in the presence of Israel, and return with me, that I may prostrate myself unto the Lord thy God.
009	1SA	015	031	So Samuel returned, following Saul; and Saul prostrated himself to the Lord.
009	1SA	015	032	And Samuel said, Bring ye hither unto me Agag the king of the 'Amalekites: and Agag came unto him cheerfully; and Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.
009	1SA	015	033	And Samuel said, As thy sword did make women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women; and Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the Lord in Gilgal.
009	1SA	015	034	Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house at Gib'ah of Saul.
009	1SA	015	035	And Samuel did not see Saul any more until the day of his death; because Samuel mourned for Saul; and the Lord repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.
009	1SA	016	001	And the Lord said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him so as not to reign over Israel? fill thy horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Beth-lechemite; for I have selected among his sons unto myself a king.
009	1SA	016	002	And Samuel said, How shall I go? if Saul should hear it, he would kill me. And the Lord said, Take a heifer with thee, and say, To sacrifice unto the Lord am I come.
009	1SA	016	003	And invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will let thee know what thou shalt do; and thou shalt anoint unto me the one whom I will say unto thee.
009	1SA	016	004	And Samuel did that which the Lord had spoken, and came to Beth-lechem. And the elders of the town came hastily to meet him, and said, Peace to thee at thy coming.
009	1SA	016	005	And he said, Peace: to sacrifice unto the Lord am I come; sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and invited them to the sacrifice.
009	1SA	016	006	And it came to pass, when they came, that he saw Eliab, and said, Surely the Lord's anointed is [here] before him.
009	1SA	016	007	But the Lord said unto Samuel, Regard not his appearance, nor the height of his stature; because I have rejected him; for not what man looketh on; —for man looketh on the eyes, but the Lord looketh on the heart.
009	1SA	016	008	Then Jesse called Abinadab, and caused him to pass before Samuel. And he said, This one also hath the Lord not chosen.
009	1SA	016	009	Then Jesse caused Shammah to pass by. And he said, This one also hath the Lord not chosen.
009	1SA	016	010	And Jesse caused seven of his sons to pass before Samuel: and Samuel said unto Jesse, The Lord hath not made choice of these.
009	1SA	016	011	And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are there not more young men? And he said, There is yet left behind the youngest, and, behold, he is feeding the flocks. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him; for we will not sit down till he have come hither.
009	1SA	016	012	And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, having withal handsome eyes, and being of a goodly appearance. And the Lord said, Arise, anoint him; for this is he.
009	1SA	016	013	Then took Samuel the horn of oil, and anointed him from among his brothers; and the Spirit of the Lord came suddenly upon David from that day and forward. And Samuel then rose up, and went to Ramah.
009	1SA	016	014	And the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and there troubled him an evil spirit from the Lord.
009	1SA	016	015	And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.
009	1SA	016	016	Let our Lord but say [the word], and thy servants, now before thee, will seek out a man, who is skilful as a player on the harp; and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, that thou mayest be well.
009	1SA	016	017	And Saul said unto his servants, Select for me, I pray you, a man that can play well, and bring him to me.
009	1SA	016	018	Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Beth-lechemite, who is skilful as a player, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and intelligent in speech, and a person of a good form, and the Lord is with him.
009	1SA	016	019	Thereupon Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, who is with the flocks.
009	1SA	016	020	And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them through David his son unto Saul.
009	1SA	016	021	And David came to Saul, and stood before him; and he loved him greatly, and he became his armor-bearer.
009	1SA	016	022	And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favor in my eyes.
009	1SA	016	023	And it came to pass, when the spirit of God was upon Saul, that David took the harp, and played with his hand; so Saul became relieved, and he felt well, and the evil spirit departed from him.
009	1SA	017	001	And the Philistines gathered together their camps to battle, and they gathered themselves together at Sochoh, which belongeth to Judah; and they encamped between Sochoh and 'Azekah, at Ephess-dammim.
009	1SA	017	002	And Saul and the men of Israel gathered themselves together, and encamped in the valley of Elah, and put themselves in battle-array opposite to the Philistines.
009	1SA	017	003	And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and the Israelites stood on a mountain on the other side: and the valley was between them.
009	1SA	017	004	And there went out the champion out of the camp of the Philistines, Goliath of Gath was his name, whose height was six cubits and a span.
009	1SA	017	005	And he had a helmet of copper upon his head, and he was clothed with a scaly coat of mail; and the weight of the coat of mail was five thousand shekels of copper.
009	1SA	017	006	And he had greaves of copper upon his legs, and a javelin of copper between his shoulders.
009	1SA	017	007	And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and the blade of his spear [weighed] six hundred shekels of iron: and the shield-bearer was walking before him.
009	1SA	017	008	And he stood and calleth unto the arrays of Israel, and said unto them, Why will ye come out to put yourselves in battle-array? Behold: I am the Philistine, and ye are servants to Saul! select for yourselves one man, and let him come down to me;
009	1SA	017	009	If he be able to fight with me, and he kill me, then will we be unto you as servants; but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be unto us as servants, and ye shall serve us.
009	1SA	017	010	And the Philistine said, I have defied the arrays of Israel this day; give me a man, and let us fight together.
009	1SA	017	011	When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were disheartened, and became greatly afraid.
009	1SA	017	012	Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Beth-lechem-judah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man was old in the days of Saul, belonging to the persons [of high esteem].
009	1SA	017	013	And the three eldest sons of Jesse were gone following Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that were gone to the battle were Eliab the first-born, and the next to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.
009	1SA	017	014	And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul.
009	1SA	017	015	But David kept going and returning from Saul to feed his father's flocks at Beth-lechem.
009	1SA	017	016	And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.
009	1SA	017	017	And Jesse said unto David his son, Take, I pray thee, for thy brothers an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to thy brothers;
009	1SA	017	018	And these ten cheeses shalt thou bring unto the captain of the thousand, and inquire of thy brothers how they fare, and take away their pledge.
009	1SA	017	019	Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.
009	1SA	017	020	And David rose up early in the morning, and gave up the flocks to a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the entrenchment, as the host was going forth in battle-array, and shouted the battle-cry.
009	1SA	017	021	And the Israelites and the Philistines put themselves in battle-array, army against army.
009	1SA	017	022	And David left the articles which he had on him in the hand of the keeper of the baggage, and ran into the array, and came and asked of his brothers after their welfare.
009	1SA	017	023	And as he was speaking with them, behold, there came up the champion, Goliath the Philistine, by name, of Gath, out of the battle-arrays of the Philistines, and spoke in accordance with these same words: and David heard it.
009	1SA	017	024	And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from before him, and were greatly afraid.
009	1SA	017	025	And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is coming forth? for to defy Israel is he coming forth; and it shall be, that the man who killeth him, —him will the king enrich with great riches, and his daughter will he give him, and his father's house will he make free in Israel.
009	1SA	017	026	And David said to the men that stood by him, thus, What shall be done to the man that may smite yon Philistine, and take away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the arrays of the living God?
009	1SA	017	027	And the people spoke to him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that may smite him.
009	1SA	017	028	And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he was speaking unto the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why didst thou come down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy presumption, and the wickedness of thy heart; for in order to see the battle art thou come down.
009	1SA	017	029	And David said, What have I now done? It is nothing but a word.
009	1SA	017	030	And he turned from him toward another, and spoke after the same manner: and the people made him again a reply after the former manner.
009	1SA	017	031	And the words which David had spoken were heard, and they told them in the presence of Saul, who sent for him.
009	1SA	017	032	And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him: thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.
009	1SA	017	033	And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go unto this Philistine to fight with him; for thou art but a lad, and he [hath been] a man of war from his youth.
009	1SA	017	034	And David said unto Saul, Thy servant was feeding his father's flocks, and there came a lion, and a bear, and bore off a lamb out of the drove;
009	1SA	017	035	And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth: and when he rose up against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.
009	1SA	017	036	Both the lion and the bear did thy servant smite: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall become as one of them; because he hath defied the arrays of the living God.
009	1SA	017	037	Moreover David said, The Lord who hath delivered me out of the power of the lion, and out of the power of the bear, will also surely deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and may the Lord be with thee.
009	1SA	017	038	And Saul clothed David with his garments, and he put a helmet of copper upon his head; and he clothed him also with a coat of mail.
009	1SA	017	039	And David girded his sword over his garments, and he essayed to go; for he had not tried it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot walk in these [things]; for I have never tried it before. And David put them off from him.
009	1SA	017	040	And he took his staff in his hand, and chose himself five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in the shepherd's pouch which be had, even in a scrip, with his sling in his hand; and he approached to the Philistine.
009	1SA	017	041	And the Philistine went and drew nearer and nearer unto David; and the man that bore the shield went before him.
009	1SA	017	042	And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him; for he was but a lad, and ruddy, with a fair appearance.
009	1SA	017	043	And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest unto me with sticks? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
009	1SA	017	044	And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the heavens, and to the beasts of the field.
009	1SA	017	045	Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest unto me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a javelin; but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the arrays of Israel, that thou hast defied.
009	1SA	017	046	This day will the Lord deliver thee into my hand; and I will smite thee, and remove thy head from thee; and I will give the carcasses of the army of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; and all the earth shall know that there is a God for Israel.
009	1SA	017	047	And all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not through sword and spear; for the battle is the Lord's, and he will give you up into our hand.
009	1SA	017	048	And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and went and drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the battle-array to meet the Philistine.
009	1SA	017	049	And David put his hand into the pouch, and took thence a stone, and slung it, and he struck the Philistine on his forehead, and the stone sunk into his forehead: and he fell upon his face to the ground.
009	1SA	017	050	So David prevailed over the Philistine with the sling and with the stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.
009	1SA	017	051	And David ran, and stood by the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of its sheath, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw that their hero was dead, they fled.
009	1SA	017	052	And then arose the men of Israel and of Judah, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou comest to the valley, and to the gates of 'Ekron. And the slain of the Philistines fell down by the way to Sha'arayim, even as far as Gath, and up to 'Ekron.
009	1SA	017	053	And the children of Israel returned from hotly pursuing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their camps.
009	1SA	017	054	And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but his weapons he placed in his tent.
009	1SA	017	055	And when Saul saw David going forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the army, Abner, whose son is this lad? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I know it not.
009	1SA	017	056	And the king said, Ask thou whose son this youth is.
009	1SA	017	057	And as David returned from smiting the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.
009	1SA	017	058	And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, young man? And David answered, The son of thy servant Jesse the Beth-lechemite.
009	1SA	018	001	And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit on the soul of David; and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.
009	1SA	018	002	And Saul took him on that day, and would not permit him to go home to his father's house.
009	1SA	018	003	Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because of his loving him as his own soul.
009	1SA	018	004	And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that he had upon him, and gave it to David, and likewise his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.
009	1SA	018	005	And David went out; whithersoever Saul used to send him, he was successful; and Saul set him over the men of war; and he was accepted in the eyes of all the people, and also in the eyes of the servants of Saul.
009	1SA	018	006	And it came to pass as they came home, when David returned from smiting the Philistines, that the women came forth out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tambourines, with joy, and with triangles.
009	1SA	018	007	And the women that played answered one another, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.
009	1SA	018	008	And Saul was very wroth, and this saying was displeasing in his eyes; and he said, They have given unto David ten thousands, and to me they have given the thousands: and all that he lacketh now yet is only the kingdom.
009	1SA	018	009	And Saul looked jealous on David from that day and forward.
009	1SA	018	010	And it came to pass on the morrow, that an evil spirit from God came suddenly over Saul, and he spoke foolish things in the midst of the house: while David was playing with his hand, as on previous days; and the spear was in the hand of Saul.
009	1SA	018	011	And Saul cast the spear; and he thought, I will strike David through even on the wall. And David turned aside out of his presence twice.
009	1SA	018	012	And Saul was afraid of David; because the Lord was with him, and from Saul he was departed.
009	1SA	018	013	Therefore Saul removed him from himself, and made him his captain over a thousand: and he went out and came in before the people.
009	1SA	018	014	And David was successful on all his ways; and the Lord was with him.
009	1SA	018	015	And when Saul saw that he was very successful, he was in dread of him.
009	1SA	018	016	But all Israel and Judah loved David; because he went out and came in before them.
009	1SA	018	017	And Saul said to David, Behold, here is my eldest daughter Merab, her will I give to thee for wife: only be thou unto me a man of valor, and fight the Lord's battles. And Saul thought, Let not my hand be against him, but let the hand of the Philistines be against him.
009	1SA	018	018	And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, [or] my father's family in Israel, that I should be a son-in-law to the king?
009	1SA	018	019	But it happened at the time when Merab, Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that she was given unto 'Adriel the Mecholathite for wife.
009	1SA	018	020	And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told it to Saul, and the thing was right in his eyes.
009	1SA	018	021	And Saul said, I will give her to him, that she may become unto him a snare, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, Through the second shalt thou this day become my son-in-law.
009	1SA	018	022	And Saul commanded his servants, Speak to David secretly, saying, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee; and now thou must become the king's son-in-law.
009	1SA	018	023	And the servants of Saul spoke in the ears of David these words. And David said, Doth it seem so light in your eyes to become the king's son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man, and of light esteem?
009	1SA	018	024	And the servants of Saul told him, saying, Words such as these David hath spoken.
009	1SA	018	025	And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged on the king's enemies. But Saul thought to cause David to fall by the hand of the Philistines.
009	1SA	018	026	And when his servants told David these words, the thing was pleasing in the eyes of David to become the king's son-in-law: and the days were not complete,
009	1SA	018	027	When David arose and went, he and his men, and smote of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they counted them out in full to the king, that he might become the king's son-in-law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter for wife.
009	1SA	018	028	And Saul saw and understood that the Lord was with David: and Michal, Saul's daughter, loved him.
009	1SA	018	029	And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul was David's enemy all the time.
009	1SA	018	030	And the princes of the Philistines went forth; and it came to pass, whenever they went forth, that David was more successful than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was highly prized.
009	1SA	019	001	And Saul spoke to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that he would kill David. But Jonathan the son of Saul delighted greatly in David.
009	1SA	019	002	And Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee; now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself in the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself:
009	1SA	019	003	And I will go out and stand by the side of my father in the field where thou art, and I myself will speak of thee to my father; and I will see what it is, and I will tell thee.
009	1SA	019	004	And Jonathan spoke favorably of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; since he hath not sinned against thee, and because his deeds are very good for thee;
009	1SA	019	005	And he did put his life in his hand, and he slew the Philistine, and the Lord wrought a great salvation for all Israel; thou sawest it, and wast rejoiced: wherefore then wilt thou commit sin on innocent blood, by slaying David without a cause?
009	1SA	019	006	And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul swore, As the Lord liveth, he shall not be put to death.
009	1SA	019	007	And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan told him all these words. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past.
009	1SA	019	008	And the war occurred again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and smote them with a great defeat, and they fled from before him.
009	1SA	019	009	And the evil spirit from the Lord came upon Saul, and he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand; and David was playing with his hand.
009	1SA	019	010	And Saul sought to strike David through with the spear even to the wall; but he slipped away from before Saul, who struck the spear into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.
009	1SA	019	011	But Saul sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning; and Michal his wife told it to David, saying, If thou save not thy life this night, tomorrow thou wilt be put to death.
009	1SA	019	012	And Michal let David down through the window: and he went, and fled, and escaped.
009	1SA	019	013	And Michal took an image, and put it in the bed, and a pillow of goats' hair she put for its head to rest on, and covered it with a cloth.
009	1SA	019	014	And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.
009	1SA	019	015	And Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may put him to death.
009	1SA	019	016	And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image in the bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for its head to rest on.
009	1SA	019	017	And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou thus deceived me, and sent away my enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal said to Saul, He said unto me, Let me go away: why should I kill thee?
009	1SA	019	018	So David fled, and escaped, and came unto Samuel to Ramah, and he told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and remained in Nayoth.
009	1SA	019	019	And it was told unto Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Nayoth near Ramah.
009	1SA	019	020	And Saul sent messengers to take David; and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as superintendent over them: then came upon the messengers of Saul the spirit of God, and they also prophesied.
009	1SA	019	021	And when it was told to Saul, he sent other messengers, and these prophesied likewise. And Saul sent again messengers the third time, and these also prophesied.
009	1SA	019	022	Then went he himself also to Ramah, and came as far as the great well that is in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And some one said, Behold, they are at Nayoth near Ramah.
009	1SA	019	023	And he went thither to Nayoth near Ramah: and there came upon him also the Spirit of God, and he went on, and prophesied as he went, until he came to Nayoth near Ramah.
009	1SA	019	024	And he also stripped off his clothes, and he also prophesied himself before Samuel, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Therefore people are in the habit of saying, Is Saul too among the prophets?
009	1SA	020	001	And David fled from Nayoth near Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is my iniquity? and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?
009	1SA	020	002	And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father is not wont to do a great thing or a small thing, which he doth not inform me of; and why should my father conceal this thing from me? it is not so.
009	1SA	020	003	But David swore again, and said, Thy father well knoweth that I have found grace in thy eyes; wherefore he said, Jonathan must not know this, lest he be grieved: nevertheless, as truly as the Lord liveth, and thy soul liveth, there was but one step between me and death.
009	1SA	020	004	Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul sayeth will I do for thee.
009	1SA	020	005	And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, tomorrow is the new-moon, and I should as usual sit with the king to eat; but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field until the third evening.
009	1SA	020	006	If thy father at all miss me, then do thou say, David asked earnestly leave of me that he might run to Beth-lechem his city; for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.
009	1SA	020	007	If he should say thus, It is well: then shall thy servant have peace; but if it be at all displeasing to him, then know that the evil is determined on by him.
009	1SA	020	008	And do thou deal kindly with thy servant; for into a covenant of the Lord hast thou brought thy servant with thee; but if there be in me any iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldst thou bring me to thy father?
009	1SA	020	009	And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee; for if I should know for certain that evil were determined on by my father to come upon thee, would I not tell it thee?
009	1SA	020	010	Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell it me? or what, if thy father answer thee roughly?
009	1SA	020	011	And Jonathan said unto David, Come, let us go out into the field. And they went out, both of them, into the field.
009	1SA	020	012	And Jonathan said unto David, May the God of Israel [punish me] if, when I have sounded my father about this time tomorrow, or of the third day, and, behold, if he be good toward David, I do not then send unto thee, and inform thee of it.
009	1SA	020	013	May the Lord do so to Jonathan and continue so yet farther, that, if it please my father [to do] thee evil, I will inform thee of it, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace; and may the Lord be with thee, as he hath been with my father.
009	1SA	020	014	And wilt thou not, should I be yet alive, show me the kindness of the Lord, that I may not die?
009	1SA	020	015	But, surely, thou wilt not withdraw thy kindness from my house for ever, not even when the Lord cutteth off the enemies of David, every one, from off the face of the earth.
009	1SA	020	016	So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, [saying,] May the Lord require it at the hand of David's enemies.
009	1SA	020	017	And Jonathan caused David to swear again, by his love for him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul.
009	1SA	020	018	Then Jonathan said to David, Tomorrow is the new-moon: and thou wilt be missed, because thy seat will be left empty.
009	1SA	020	019	And when thou hast stayed till the third day, then shalt thou go down greatly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself on the work-day; and thou shalt remain by the stone Ezel.
009	1SA	020	020	And I will myself shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I were shooting at a mark.
009	1SA	020	021	And, behold, I will send the lad, saying, Go, find the arrows; if I should now say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee: then take him and come; for there is peace to thee, and it is nothing; as the Lord liveth.
009	1SA	020	022	But if thus I should say unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee: then go thy way, for the Lord hath sent thee off.
009	1SA	020	023	And touching the matter of which we have spoken, thou and I, behold, the Lord is between me and thee for ever.
009	1SA	020	024	So David hid himself in the field: and when the new-moon was come, the king set himself down to the repast to eat.
009	1SA	020	025	And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, upon the seat by the wall: and when Jonathan arose, Abner seated himself by the side of Saul, and David's place was left empty.
009	1SA	020	026	Nevertheless Saul spoke not the least on that day; for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; because he hath not yet purified himself.
009	1SA	020	027	And it came to pass on the morrow, the second day of the new-moon, that David's place was left empty; and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore is the son of Jesse not come, both yesterday and today, to the repast?
009	1SA	020	028	And Jonathan answered Saul, David asked earnestly leave of me to go as far as Beth-lechem.
009	1SA	020	029	And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for we have a family-sacrifice in the city, and my brother himself hath commanded it to me; and now, if I have found favor in thy eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, that I may see my brothers: therefore is he not come unto the king's table.
009	1SA	020	030	And the anger of Saul was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of perverse rebelliousness! do I not know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thy own shame, and to the shame of thy mother's nakedness?
009	1SA	020	031	For all the days that the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou wilt not have any permanence with thy kingdom: therefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.
009	1SA	020	032	And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be put to death? what hath he done?
009	1SA	020	033	And Saul cast his spear at him to smite him: and Jonathan understood that it was determined on by his father to put David to death.
009	1SA	020	034	And Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no food on the second day of the new-moon; for he was grieved for David; because his father had made him feel ashamed.
009	1SA	020	035	And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field to the place appointed with David, and a little lad was with him.
009	1SA	020	036	And he said unto his lad, Run, do find out the arrows which I shoot: and the lad ran, and he shot the arrow so as to pass beyond him.
009	1SA	020	037	And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan called after the lad, and said, Behold, the arrow is beyond thee!
009	1SA	020	038	And Jonathan called after the lad, Make haste, speed, stay not: and Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.
009	1SA	020	039	But the lad knew not the least: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.
009	1SA	020	040	And Jonathan gave his weapons unto the lad who was with him, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city.
009	1SA	020	041	And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose from the south side [of the stone], and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.
009	1SA	020	042	And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace: what we have sworn, both of us, in the name of the Lord, saying, The Lord shall be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever, [shall be kept]. And he arose and departed; and Jonathan went into the city.
009	1SA	021	001	And David came to Nob to Achimelech the priest; and Achimelech hastened trembling to meet David, and said unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man is with thee?
009	1SA	021	002	And David said unto Achimelech the priest, The king commanded me a business, and said unto me, Let not any man know the least of the business concerning which I send thee, and which I have commanded thee. And the young men have I appointed to such and such a place.
009	1SA	021	003	And now what hast thou on hand: put five loaves of bread into my hand, or what else can be found.
009	1SA	021	004	And the priest answered David, and said, I have no common bread on hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have only withheld themselves from women.
009	1SA	021	005	And David answered the priest and said to him, To a certainty women have been denied us yesterday and the day before, when I went forth, and the vessels of the young men were holy: and if this was the custom with unholy things, how much more will it remain this day holy in the vessels.
009	1SA	021	006	So the priest gave him hallowed bread; for there was no bread there except the showbread, that was removed from before the Lord, so as to put down hot bread on the day when it was taken away.
009	1SA	021	007	Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there on that day, detained before the Lord; and his name was Doeg, the Edomite, the chief of the herdsmen that belonged to Saul.
009	1SA	021	008	And David said unto Achimelech, Hast thou not also here at hand a spear or sword: for both my sword as also my other weapons have I not brought with me, because the king's business was urgent.
009	1SA	021	009	And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou didst slay in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped up in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that for thyself, take it; for there is no other save it here. And David said, There is none like that: give it to me.
009	1SA	021	010	And David arose, and fled on that day from before Saul, and came to Achish the king of Gath.
009	1SA	021	011	And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not of this man sing one to another in the dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
009	1SA	021	012	And David took these words to his heart, and was greatly afraid of Achish the king of Gath.
009	1SA	021	013	And he disguised his reason before their eyes, and played the madman in their hands, and scribbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle run down upon his beard.
009	1SA	021	014	Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see, the man is mad: wherefore then will ye bring him to me?
009	1SA	021	015	Have I lack of madmen, that ye have brought this man to play his pranks about me? shall this one come into my house?
009	1SA	022	001	And David departed thence, and escaped to the cave 'Adullam: and when his brothers and all his father's house heard it, they went down to him thither.
009	1SA	022	002	And there gathered themselves unto him every one that was in distress, and every one that had a creditor, and every one that had an embittered spirit; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.
009	1SA	022	003	And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, go forth with you, until I can know what God will do for me.
009	1SA	022	004	And he conducted them to the presence of the king of Moab: and they remained with him all the time that David was in the strong-hold.
009	1SA	022	005	And the prophet Gad said unto David, Thou must not remain in the strong-hold: depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Chereth.
009	1SA	022	006	And Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him, [now Saul was sitting in Gib'ah under the tamarisk on the hill, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him;]
009	1SA	022	007	Then said Saul unto his servants that stood about him, Hear, I pray you, men of Benjamin! will the son of Jesse give, indeed, to every one of you fields and vineyards? will he appoint you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds?
009	1SA	022	008	That ye have conspired, all of you, against me, and there is none that informeth me, while my son hath made a covenant with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is concerned for me, or informeth me that my son hath stirred up my servant to lie in wait against me, as it is this day?
009	1SA	022	009	Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Achimelech the son of Achitub.
009	1SA	022	010	And he asked counsel for him of the Lord, and he gave him provision, and gave him also the sword of Goliath the philistine.
009	1SA	022	011	Then sent the king to call Achimelech, the son of Achitub, the priest, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came, all of them, to the king.
009	1SA	022	012	And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Achitub. And he said, here am I, my Lord.
009	1SA	022	013	And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou didst give him bread, and a sword, and hast asked counsel for him of God, that he should rise to lie in wait against me, as it is this day!
009	1SA	022	014	Then answered Achimelech the king, and said, And who is among all thy servants so trusted as David, and the king's son-in-law, and freely admitted to thy private council, and is honored in thy house?
009	1SA	022	015	Did I this day then begin to ask counsel for him of God? far be it from me; let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, [nor] to all the house of my father; for thy servant knew not of all this, either a little or great thing.
009	1SA	022	016	And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Achimelech, thou, and all thy father's house.
009	1SA	022	017	And the king said unto the runners that stood about him, Turn round and slay the priests of the Lord; because their hand also is with David, and because they knew that he was fleeing, and did not disclose it to me. But the servants of the king would not stretch forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the Lord.
009	1SA	022	018	And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou round, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned round, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day eighty and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.
009	1SA	022	019	And Nob, the city of the priests, he smote with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and lambs, with the edge of the sword.
009	1SA	022	020	And there escaped one of the sons of Achimelech the son of Achitub, whose name was Ebyathar, and he fled after David.
009	1SA	022	021	And Ebyathar told David that Saul had slain the priests of the Lord.
009	1SA	022	022	And David said unto Ebyathar, I knew on that day, because Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have myself occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father's house.
009	1SA	022	023	Remain thou with me, fear nothing; for he that will seek my life will seek thy life; but thou shalt be well guarded with me.
009	1SA	023	001	Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Ke'ilah, and they are plundering the threshing-floors.
009	1SA	023	002	Thereupon David asked counsel of the Lord, saying, Shall I go and smite among these Philistines? And the Lord said unto David, Go and smite among the Philistines, and deliver Ke'ilah.
009	1SA	023	003	And David's men said unto him, Behold, here in Judah are we afraid: how much more then if we should go to Ke'ilah against the battle-arrays of the Philistines?
009	1SA	023	004	Then David asked yet again counsel of the Lord. And the Lord answered him and said, Arise, Go down to Ke'ilah; for I [will] deliver the Philistines into thy hand.
009	1SA	023	005	So David and his men went to Ke'ilah; and he fought with the Philistines, and lead away their cattle, and smote among them a great slaughter. So David delivered the inhabitants of Ke'ilah.
009	1SA	023	006	And it came to pass, when Ebyathar the son of Achimelech, fled over to David, to Ke'ilah, that the ephod came down with him.
009	1SA	023	007	And it was told to Saul that David was come to Ke'ilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into my hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.
009	1SA	023	008	And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Ke'ilah, to besiege David and his men.
009	1SA	023	009	And David understood that Saul secretly devised mischief against him; and he said to Ebyathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.
009	1SA	023	010	Then said David, O Lord, God of Israel, thy servant hath heard for certain that Saul seeketh to come to Ke'ilah, to destroy the city for my sake.
009	1SA	023	011	Will the men of Ke'ilah surrender me into his hand? will Saul come down as thy servant hath heard? O Lord, God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the Lord said, He will come down.
009	1SA	023	012	Then said David, Will the men of Ke'ilah surrender me and my men into the hand of Saul! And the Lord said, They will surrender.
009	1SA	023	013	Then arose David and his men, about six hundred men, and departed out of Ke'ilah, and wandered about whithersoever they could go. And when it was told to Saul that David was escaped from Ke'ilah, he forbore to go forth.
009	1SA	023	014	And David remained in the wilderness in strong-holds, and abode on the mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him all the time, but God delivered him not into his hand.
009	1SA	023	015	And David saw that Saul was gone forth to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in the forest.
009	1SA	023	016	And Jonathan, the son of Saul, arose and went to David into the forest, and strengthened his hand in God.
009	1SA	023	017	And he said unto him, Fear not; for the hand of Saul my father will not find thee; and thou wilt be king over Israel, and I will be next unto thee; and also Saul my father knoweth this.
009	1SA	023	018	And they made, both of them, a covenant before the Lord: and David remained in the forest; but Jonathan went to his house.
009	1SA	023	019	Then came up the Ziphites unto Saul to Gib'ah, saying, Behold, David is hiding himself with us in the strong-holds in the forest, on the hill of Chachilah, which is on the right of the desert.
009	1SA	023	020	And now in accordance with all the longing of thy soul, O king, to come down, come down; and our part shall be to surrender him into the king's hand.
009	1SA	023	021	And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the Lord; for ye have pity on me.
009	1SA	023	022	Go, I pray you, make yet more preparations, and remark and see his place where his foot may be, who hath seen him there; for I am told that he dealeth with great subtilty.
009	1SA	023	023	See therefore, and remark every one of all the lurking-places where he usually hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you; and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.
009	1SA	023	024	And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul; but David and his men were in the wilderness of Ma'on, in the plain on the right of the desert.
009	1SA	023	025	And Saul and his men went to make a search. And they told it to David: wherefore he came down to the rock, and abode in the wilderness of Ma'on. And when Saul heard this, he pursued after David into the wilderness of Ma'on.
009	1SA	023	026	And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain; and David made haste to get away from before Saul; and Saul and his men were compassing David and his men to seize them.
009	1SA	023	027	But a messenger came unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.
009	1SA	023	028	Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Sela-hammachlekoth.
009	1SA	023	029	And David went up from there, and dwelt in strong-holds of 'En-gedi.
009	1SA	024	001	And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from pursuing the Philistines, that it was told to him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of 'En-gedi.
009	1SA	024	002	Then took Saul three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.
009	1SA	024	003	And he came to the sheepfolds by the way, and there was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men were sitting in the lower end of the cave.
009	1SA	024	004	And the men of David said unto him, Behold, this is the day of which the Lord hath said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thy enemy into thy hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good in thy eyes. And David arose, and cut off the corner of the robe which Saul wore, unperceived.
009	1SA	024	005	And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off the corner of Saul's [robe].
009	1SA	024	006	And he said unto his men, Far be it from me for the Lord's sake, that I should do this thing unto my master, the Lord's anointed, to stretch forth my hand against him; because he is the anointed of the Lord.
009	1SA	024	007	So David restrained his servants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.
009	1SA	024	008	David also arose afterward, and went forth out of the cave, and called after Saul, saying, My Lord, the king! And Saul then looked behind him, and David bowed his face to the earth, and prostrated himself.
009	1SA	024	009	And David said to Saul, Wherefore wilt thou listen to men's words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy injury?
009	1SA	024	010	Behold, this day thy eyes have seen how that the Lord had delivered thee today into my hand in the cave, and some one said that I should kill thee: but my soul felt compassion for thee: and I said, I will not stretch forth my hand against my Lord; because he is the anointed of the Lord.
009	1SA	024	011	And now, my father, see, yea, see the corner of thy robe in my hand; for in that I cut off the corner of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in my hand, and that I have not sinned against thee: yet thou liest in wait for my soul to take it.
009	1SA	024	012	May the Lord judge between me and thee, and may the Lord avenge me on thee; but my hand shall not be against thee.
009	1SA	024	013	As saith the proverb of the ancients, From the wicked proceedeth wickedness; but my hand shall not be against thee.
009	1SA	024	014	After whom is the king of Israel gone out? after whom art thou pursuing? after a dead dog, after a single flea.
009	1SA	024	015	May the Lord therefore be judge, and decide between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and obtain me justice out of thy hand.
009	1SA	024	016	And it came to pass, When David had finished speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.
009	1SA	024	017	And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I; for thou hast done for me only what is good, whereas I have rewarded thee only with what is evil.
009	1SA	024	018	And thou hast proved this day, that thou hast dealt well with me; forasmuch as when the Lord had surrendered me into thy hand, thou didst not kill me.
009	1SA	024	019	For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go away on a good road? so may the Lord reward thee with good for what thou hast done unto me this day.
009	1SA	024	020	And now, behold, I know that thou wilt surely become king, and that the kingdom of Israel will stand firmly in thy hand.
009	1SA	024	021	And now swear unto me by the Lord, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father's house.
009	1SA	024	022	And David swore unto Saul; and Saul went to his house; but David and his men went up into the strong-hold.
009	1SA	025	001	And Samuel died; and all the Israelites assembled themselves together, and lamented for him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.
009	1SA	025	002	And there was a man in Ma'on, whose business was in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was, while they were shearing his sheep, at Carmel.
009	1SA	025	003	Now the name of the man was Nabal, and the name of his wife Abigayil: and the woman was of good understanding, and of a beautiful form; but the man was hard-hearted and evil in his deeds; and he was of the house of Caleb.
009	1SA	025	004	And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.
009	1SA	025	005	And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and ask him in my name after his well-being.
009	1SA	025	006	And ye shall say, May it thus be throughout thy life; and peace be to thee, and peace be to thy house, and unto all that thou hast be peace.
009	1SA	025	007	And now have I heard that thou hast sheep-shearers: now thy shepherds have been with us, we have not injured them, neither hath there aught been missing unto them, all the time they were at Carmel.
009	1SA	025	008	Ask thy young men, and they will tell it thee. Therefore let the young men find favor in thy eyes; for on a festive day are we come: give, I pray thee, whatsoever thy hand is capable of unto thy servants, and to thy son, to David.
009	1SA	025	009	And David's young men came, and they spoke to Nabal in accordance with all these words in the name of David; and then they ceased.
009	1SA	025	010	And Nabal answered the servants of David, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? now-a-days there are many servants that break away every one from his master.
009	1SA	025	011	Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my sheep-shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they are?
009	1SA	025	012	And David's young men turned about on their way, and returned, and came and told him in accordance with all these words.
009	1SA	025	013	And David said unto his men, Gird ye on, every man, his sword. And they girded on, every man, his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men, and two hundred abode by the baggage.
009	1SA	025	014	But one of the young men told Abigayil, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to greet our master; but he hath spoken rudely to them.
009	1SA	025	015	Whereas the men have been very good unto us; and we have not been injured, neither have we missed any thing, all the time that we went about with them, while we were in the field:
009	1SA	025	016	A wall were they around us both by night and by day, all the time we were with them, feeding the flocks.
009	1SA	025	017	And now know and consider what thou canst do; for evil is determined on against our master, and against all his household; and he is too greatly a worthless man for me to speak to him.
009	1SA	025	018	And Abigayil made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.
009	1SA	025	019	And she said unto her young men, Pass on before me: behold, I come after you. But to her husband Nabal she told nothing.
009	1SA	025	020	And it was so, as she was riding on the ass, and coming down by the covert of the mount, that, behold, David and his men came down toward her; and she met them.
009	1SA	025	021	Now David had said, Yea, for naught only have I guarded all that belongeth to this fellow in the wilderness, so that not the least was missed of all that pertained unto him; and he hath requited me evil instead of good.
009	1SA	025	022	So may God do unto the enemies of David, and do so yet farther, if I leave of all that pertaineth to him by the morning light, as much as a dog.
009	1SA	025	023	And when Abigayil saw David, she hastened, and alighted off the ass, and fell down before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground.
009	1SA	025	024	And she fell at his feet, and said, On me, me, my lord, is the fault: and let thy hand-maid, I pray thee, speak in thy hearing, and listen to the words of thy hand-maid.
009	1SA	025	025	Let not my Lord, I pray thee, turn his heart unto this worthless man, unto Nabal; for as his name is, so is he: Nabal is his name, and meanness is with him; but I thy hand-maid did not see the young men of my Lord, whom thou didst send.
009	1SA	025	026	And now, my lord, as the Eternal liveth, and as thy soul liveth, it is the Lord who hath withholden thee from coming to blood-guiltiness, and from helping thyself with thy own hand; and now may like Nabal be thy enemies, and those that seek [to do] my Lord evil.
009	1SA	025	027	And now this present which thy hand-maid hath brought unto my Lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow in the train my Lord.
009	1SA	025	028	Pardon, I pray thee, the trespass of thy hand-maid; for the Lord will certainly make for my lord an enduring house; because the battles of the Lord doth my lord fight, and evil will not be found in thee all thy days.
009	1SA	025	029	And though a man is risen up to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: yet will the soul of my Lord be bound in the bond of life with the Lord thy God; and the soul of thy enemies will he hurl away, as out of the middle of the sling.
009	1SA	025	030	And it shall come to pass, when the Lord will do to my lord, in accordance with all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and will ordain thee as ruler over Israel,
009	1SA	025	031	That this shall not be unto thee as a cause of offense and as a reproach of heart unto my lord, both by having shed blood without cause, and by my lord having righted himself; and when the Lord will do good unto my lord, then do thou remember thy hand-maid.
009	1SA	025	032	And David said to Abigayil, Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who sent thee this day to meet me;
009	1SA	025	033	And blessed be thy intelligence, and blessed be thou, who hast prevented me this day from coming unto blood-guiltiness, and from helping myself with my own hand.
009	1SA	025	034	But truly, as the Lord the God of Israel liveth, who hath withdrawn me from injuring thee, except thou hadst hastened and come to meet me, surely there would not have been left unto Nabal by the morning-light so much as a dog.
009	1SA	025	035	And David took out of her hand that which she had brought him; and unto her he said, Go up in peace to thy house: see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have respected thy presence.
009	1SA	025	036	And Abigayil came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him, and he was exceedingly drunken; wherefore she told him not a word, either little or great, until the morning-light.
009	1SA	025	037	But it happened in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, that his wife told him these things; and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.
009	1SA	025	038	And it came to pass in about ten days thereafter, that the Lord struck Nabal, and he died.
009	1SA	025	039	And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the Lord, who hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath withheld his servant from evil; and the wickedness of Nabal hath the Lord returned upon his own head. And David sent and applied for Abigayil, to take her to himself for wife.
009	1SA	025	040	And the servants of David came to Abigayil to Carmel, and they spoke unto her, saying, David hath sent us unto thee, to take thee to himself for wife.
009	1SA	025	041	Thereupon she arose, and bowed herself with her face to the earth, and said, Behold, let thy hand-maid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.
009	1SA	025	042	And Abigayil hastened, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with her five damsels that went in her train; and she went after the messengers of David, and she became his wife.
009	1SA	025	043	David also took Achino'am of Yizre'el; and both of them became thus his wives.
009	1SA	025	044	But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Palti, the son of Layish, who was of Gallim.
009	1SA	026	001	And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gib'ah, saying, Behold, David hideth himself on the hill of Chachilah, before the desert.
009	1SA	026	002	Then arose Saul, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, and with him were three thousand men chosen out of Israel, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.
009	1SA	026	003	And Saul encamped on the hill of Chachilah, which is before the desert by the way; but David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul was coming after him into the wilderness.
009	1SA	026	004	David thereupon sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come for a certainty.
009	1SA	026	005	And David arose, and came to the place where Saul was encamped; and David beheld the place where Saul lay, with Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his army; and Saul was lying in the midst of the ring, and the people were encamped round about him.
009	1SA	026	006	Then commenced David and said to Achimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruyah, the brother of Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will readily go down with thee.
009	1SA	026	007	So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the ring, with his spear stuck in the ground by his head; but Abner and the people were lying round about him.
009	1SA	026	008	Then said Abishai to David, God hath surrendered this day thy enemy into thy hand: and now let me strike him through, I pray thee, with the spear, even to the earth with one blow, and I will not give him a second one.
009	1SA	026	009	But David said to Abishai, Destroy him not; for who hath stretched forth his hand against the Lord's anointed, and remained guiltless?
009	1SA	026	010	David said farthermore, As the Lord liveth, the Lord alone shall strike him down: either his day shall come that he die; or he shall go down into battle, and perish.
009	1SA	026	011	Far be this from me for the sake of the Lord, that I should stretch forth my hand against the Lord's anointed; but now, I pray thee, take thou the spear that is by his head, and the cruise of water, and let us go our way.
009	1SA	026	012	So David took the spear and the cruise of water by the head of Saul, and they went their way; and no one saw it, and no one perceived it, and-no one awaked; for they were all sleeping; because a deep sleep from the Lord was fallen upon them.
009	1SA	026	013	Then went David over to the other side, and stood on the top of the mount afar off, the space between them being great.
009	1SA	026	014	And David called to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Wilt thou not answer, Abner? And Abner answered and said, Who art thou that callest to the king?
009	1SA	026	015	And David said to Abner, Art thou not a man? and who is like to thee in Israel? why then hast thou not kept guard over thy lord the king? for there came one of the people to destroy the king thy lord.
009	1SA	026	016	This thing which thou hast done is not good. As the Lord liveth, ye deserve to die; because ye have not kept guard over your master, over the Lord's anointed. And now see, where is the king's spear, and the cruise of water that was by his head?
009	1SA	026	017	And Saul recognized David's voice, and he said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my Lord, O king.
009	1SA	026	018	And he said, Why is this that my lord doth pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in my hand?
009	1SA	026	019	And now, I pray thee, let my Lord the king hear the words of his servant! If the Lord have stirred thee up against me, then may he accept the savor of an offering; but if they be the children of men, then be they cursed before the Lord; because they have driven me out this day so that I cannot attach myself on the inheritance of the Lord, saying, Go, serve other gods.
009	1SA	026	020	Now, therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth far from the presence of the Lord; for the king of Israel is come out to seek a single flea, as one doth usually pursue a partridge on the mountains.
009	1SA	026	021	Then said Saul, I have sinned; return, my son David; for I will not do thee harm any more, for the cause that my life was precious in thy eyes this day: behold, I have acted foolishly, and have erred exceedingly much.
009	1SA	026	022	And David answered and said, Behold, here is the king's spear! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it.
009	1SA	026	023	And may the Lord recompense to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; since the Lord delivered thee into my hand today, and I would not stretch forth my hand against the anointed of the Lord.
009	1SA	026	024	And behold, as thy life was highly valued this day in my eyes, so may my life be highly valued in the eyes of the Lord, and may he deliver me out of all tribulation.
009	1SA	026	025	Then said Saul to David, Blessed be thou my son David: thou wilt both do great things, and wilt also surely prevail. And David went then on his way, and Saul returned to his place.
009	1SA	027	001	And David said in his heart, Now I may yet perish suddenly one day by the hand of Saul; there is nothing better for me than that I should escape at once into the land of the Philistines, then Saul will abstain from me, to seek me any more in all the territory of Israel: and so shall I escape out of his hand.
009	1SA	027	002	And David arose, and he passed over himself with the six hundred men that were with him unto Achish, the son of Ma'och, the king of Gath.
009	1SA	027	003	And David remained with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, also David with his two wives, Achino'am the Yizre'elitess, and Abigayil, Nabal's wife, the Carmelitess.
009	1SA	027	004	And when it was told unto Saul that David was fled to Gath, he continued no more to seek for him.
009	1SA	027	005	And David said unto Achish, If now I have found grace in thy eyes, let them give me a place in some one of the country-towns, that I may dwell there; for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?
009	1SA	027	006	Then gave Achish unto him on that day Ziklag: therefore hath Ziklag pertained unto the kings of Judah until this day.
009	1SA	027	007	And the number of the days that David dwelt in the fields of the Philistines was a full year and four months.
009	1SA	027	008	And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gizrites, and the 'Amalekites; for these nations were of old the inhabitants of the land, till thou comest to Shur, and as far as the land of Egypt.
009	1SA	027	009	And David smote the land, and left not alive either man or woman, and took away the flocks, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish.
009	1SA	027	010	And Achish said, Whither have ye made an inroad today? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Yerachmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.
009	1SA	027	011	And David left not alive either man or woman, to bring [them] to Gath, saying, That they may not tell on us, saying, So hath David done, and so is his custom all the days he hath dwelt in the fields of the Philistines.
009	1SA	027	012	And Achish had confidence in David, saying, He hath surely spoiled his odor among his people, among Israel; and he will become unto me a servant for ever.
009	1SA	028	001	And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their camps together for warfare, to fight with Israel; and Achish said unto David, Thou must know that thou shalt go out with me into the camp, thou and thy men.
009	1SA	028	002	And David said to Achish, By reason of this wilt thou thyself ascertain what thy servant will do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee the guard of my head for all times.
009	1SA	028	003	Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city; and Saul had removed those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.
009	1SA	028	004	And the Philistines assembled themselves together, and came and encamped at Shunem: and Saul assembled together all Israel, and they encamped at Gilboa'.
009	1SA	028	005	And when Saul saw the camp of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.
009	1SA	028	006	And Saul asked counsel of the Lord; but the Lord answered him not, either by means of dreams, or by means of the Urim, or by means of the prophets.
009	1SA	028	007	Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek out for me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her and inquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at 'En-dor.
009	1SA	028	008	And Saul disguised himself, and put on other garments, and he went, he and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, Divine, I pray thee, unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring up for me the one whom I shall say unto thee.
009	1SA	028	009	And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou well knowest that which Saul hath done, that he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land; wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?
009	1SA	028	010	And Saul swore to her by the Lord, saying, As the Lord liveth, there shall no guilt attach to thee for this thing.
009	1SA	028	011	Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up for thee? And he said, Samuel thou must bring up for me.
009	1SA	028	012	And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman said to Saul thus, Why hast thou deceived me? since thou art Saul.
009	1SA	028	013	And the king said unto her, Be not afraid; however, what hast thou seen? And the woman said unto Saul, A divine being have I seen ascending out of the earth.
009	1SA	028	014	And he said unto her, What is his form? And she said, An old man is coming up; and he is wrapt in a mantle. And so Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground, and prostrated himself.
009	1SA	028	015	And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am greatly distressed, and the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and hath not answered me any more, either by the agency of the prophets, or by means of dreams; wherefore I have called thee, to make known unto me what I shall do.
009	1SA	028	016	Then said Samuel, And why wilt thou ask me, seeing the Lord is departed from thee, and is become thy enemy?
009	1SA	028	017	And the Lord hath done for himself as he hath spoken through my agency; and the Lord hath rent the government out of thy hand, and hath given it to thy associate, to David;
009	1SA	028	018	As thou didst not obey the voice of the Lord, and didst not execute his fierce wrath upon 'Amalek; therefore hath the Lord done this thing unto thee this day.
009	1SA	028	019	And the Lord will deliver also Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines; and tomorrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me: also the camp of Israel will the Lord deliver into the hand of the Philistines.
009	1SA	028	020	Then fell Saul hastily with his full length to the earth, and was greatly afraid, because of the words of Samuel: there was also no strength in him; for he had not eaten any food all that day, and all that night.
009	1SA	028	021	And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was greatly terrified; and she said unto him, Behold, thy hand-maid hath obeyed thy voice; and I put my life in my hand, and hearkened unto thy words which thou spokest unto me.
009	1SA	028	022	And now, hearken thou also, I pray thee, unto the voice of thy hand-maid, and let me set before thee a morsel of bread, and eat; that thou mayest have strength when thou goest on the way.
009	1SA	028	023	But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants urged him much, as also the woman; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.
009	1SA	028	024	And the woman had a fatted calf in the house; and she hastened, and slaughtered it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread thereof:
009	1SA	028	025	And she brought it near before Saul, and before his servants; and they ate. Then they rose up, and went away that night.
009	1SA	029	001	Now the Philistines assembled together all their camps at Aphek: and the Israelites encamped by the spring which is by Yizre'el.
009	1SA	029	002	And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands; but David and his men passed on at the last with Achish.
009	1SA	029	003	Then said the princes of the Philistines, What are these Hebrews to do? And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, Behold, this is David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who hath been with me already a year, or even years, and I have not found the least in him [to blame] from the day of his joining [me] until this day?
009	1SA	029	004	And the princes of the Philistines were angry with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Cause this man to go back, that he may return to his place whither thou hast assigned him; but he shall not go down with us to the battle, that he may not become an adversary to us in the battle; for wherewith could this person reconcile himself unto his master? is it not by means of the heads of these men?
009	1SA	029	005	Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in the dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
009	1SA	029	006	Then did Achish call David, and say unto him, As the Lord liveth, [I declare] that thou art upright, and that thy going out and thy coming in with me in the camp is good in my eyes; for I have not found in thee any evil from the day of thy coming unto me until this day; nevertheless in the eyes of the lords thou art not good.
009	1SA	029	007	And now return, and go in peace, that thou mayest not do any evil in the eyes of the lords of the Philistines.
009	1SA	029	008	And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant from the day that I have been before thee, until this day, that I shall not go to fight against the enemies of my Lord the king?
009	1SA	029	009	And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art good in my eyes, as an angel of God; nevertheless, the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.
009	1SA	029	010	And now rise up early in the morning with the servants of thy master that are come with thee: and rise then up early in the morning, and when ye have light, go away.
009	1SA	029	011	And David and his men rose up early to go away in the morning, to return unto the land of the Philistines; but the Philistines went up to Yizre'el.
009	1SA	030	001	And it came to pass when David and his men came to Ziklag on the third day, that the 'Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burnt it with fire;
009	1SA	030	002	And had taken captive the women that were therein, both great and small: they had not slain any one, but had led them off, and gone on their way.
009	1SA	030	003	When therefore David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burnt with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, had been taken captive.
009	1SA	030	004	And David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.
009	1SA	030	005	And the two wives of David were also taken captive, Achino'am the Yizre'elitess, and Abigayil the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
009	1SA	030	006	And David was greatly distressed; for the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was imbittered, every man for his sons and for his daughters; but David fortified himself in the Lord his God.
009	1SA	030	007	And David said to Ebyathar the priest, the son of Achimelech, Bring hither, I pray thee, unto me the ephod. And Ebyathar brought the ephod near unto David.
009	1SA	030	008	And David asked counsel of the Lord, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop! shall I overtake them? And he said to him, Pursue; for thou wilt surely overtake them, and certainly recover [all].
009	1SA	030	009	So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came up to the brook Bessor, where those that were left behind stayed.
009	1SA	030	010	But David pursued on, he and four hundred men; and there stayed behind two hundred men, who were too fatigued to go over the brook Bessor.
009	1SA	030	011	And they found an Egyptian man in the field, and took him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water;
009	1SA	030	012	And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins, and he ate, and then his spirit returned to him; for he had not eaten any bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights.
009	1SA	030	013	And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he said, I am a young Egyptian man, the servant to an 'Amalekite; and my master left me behind, because I fell sick, today three days ago.
009	1SA	030	014	We made an invasion upon the south of the Kerethites, and upon that which belongeth to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and Ziklag did we burn with fire.
009	1SA	030	015	And David said to him, Wilt thou bring me down to this troop? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt not kill me, and that thou wilt not surrender me into the hand of my master, and then will I bring thee down to this troop.
009	1SA	030	016	And he brought him down; and behold, they were scattered over the face of all the country, eating and drinking, and dancing for joy, because of all the great spoil which they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.
009	1SA	030	017	And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day; and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, who rode upon camels, and fled.
009	1SA	030	018	And David recovered all that the 'Amalekites had taken away; and his two wives also did David rescue.
009	1SA	030	019	And there was nothing missing to them, from small to great, as also sons and daughters, and spoil, down to every thing that they had taken from them: the whole did David bring back.
009	1SA	030	020	And David took all the flocks and the herds: these they drove before those other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil.
009	1SA	030	021	And David came to the two hundred men, who had been too fatigued to follow after David, and whom they had left to remain at the brook Bessor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him; and David came near to the people, and asked them after their well-being.
009	1SA	030	022	Then exclaimed every wicked and worthless man, of those that had gone with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them aught of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, and these they may lead away, and go.
009	1SA	030	023	Then said David, Ye must not do so, my brethren; since the Lord hath given us this, and guarded us, and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand.
009	1SA	030	024	And who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as is the part of him that went down to the battle, so shall be the part of him that remained with the baggage: together must they share.
009	1SA	030	025	And it happened from that day and forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel until this day.
009	1SA	030	026	And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, to his friends, saying, Behold, here is a present for you from the spoil of the enemies of the Lord:
009	1SA	030	027	To those who were in Beth-el, and to those who were in south Ramoth, and to those who were in Yattir,
009	1SA	030	028	And to those who were in 'Aro'er, and to those who were in Siphmoth, and to those who were in Eshtemoa',
009	1SA	030	029	And to those who were in Rachal, and to those who were in the cities of Yerach-meelites, and to those who were in the cities of the Kenites,
009	1SA	030	030	And to those who were in Chormah, and to those who were in Kor-'ashan, and to those who were in 'Athach,
009	1SA	030	031	And to those who were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men had wandered about.
009	1SA	031	001	Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and there fell down [many] slain on mount Gilboa'.
009	1SA	031	002	And the Philistines overtook Saul and his sons; and the Philistines smote Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malkishua', the sons of Saul.
009	1SA	031	003	And the battle was heavy against Saul, and he was found by the archers, the men with bows; and he was greatly in dread of the archers.
009	1SA	031	004	And Saul said unto his armor-bearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and wantonly ill-use me. But his armor-bearer would not; for he was greatly afraid; wherefore Saul took the sword, and fell upon it.
009	1SA	031	005	And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, then fell he likewise upon his sword, and died with him.
009	1SA	031	006	Thus died Saul, and his three sons, and his armor-bearer, also all his men, on that same day together.
009	1SA	031	007	And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and those that were on the other side of the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel had fled, and that Saul and his sons had died: they forsook the cities, and fled away; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
009	1SA	031	008	And it came to pass on the morrow, that the Philistines came to strip the slain; and they found Saul and his three sons fallen on mount Gilboa'.
009	1SA	031	009	And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armor, and sent it into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it in the house of their idols, and among the people.
009	1SA	031	010	And they put his armor in the house of 'Ashtaroth; and his body they fastened to the wall of Beth-shan.
009	1SA	031	011	And when the inhabitants of Yabeshgil'ad heard concerning him that which the Philistines had done to Saul:
009	1SA	031	012	Then arose all the valiant men, and walked all the night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan, and they came to Yabesh, and burnt them there.
009	1SA	031	013	And they took their bones, and buried them under the tamarisk-tree at Yabesh, and they fasted seven days.

010	2SA	001	001	Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from smiting the 'Amalekites, that David abode in Ziklag two days.
010	2SA	001	002	And it came to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and it happened, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and prostrated himself.
010	2SA	001	003	And David said unto him, From where comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.
010	2SA	001	004	And David said unto him, What took place there? I pray thee, tell me. And he said, That the people are fled from the battle, and that also many of the people are fallen and have died; and that also Saul and Jonathan his son are dead.
010	2SA	001	005	And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul is dead as also Jonathan his son?
010	2SA	001	006	And the young man that told him said, I happened entirely by chance to be upon mount Gilboa', when, behold, there was Saul leaning upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen had overtaken him.
010	2SA	001	007	And he turned round, and he saw me, and called unto me, And I said, Here am I.
010	2SA	001	008	And he said unto me, Who art thou! And I answered him, An 'Amalekite am I.
010	2SA	001	009	And he said unto me, Place thyself, I pray thee, by me, and slay me; for a mortal tremor hath seized on me, although my life is yet whole in me.
010	2SA	001	010	So I placed myself by him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after his fall; and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and I have brought them unto my lord hither.
010	2SA	001	011	David thereupon took hold of his clothes, and rent them; and [so did] likewise all the men that were with him:
010	2SA	001	012	And they lamented, and wept, and fasted until the evening, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the Lord, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.
010	2SA	001	013	And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he said, The son of a stranger, an 'Amalekite, am I.
010	2SA	001	014	And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thy hand to destroy the Lord's anointed?
010	2SA	001	015	And David called one of the young men, and said, Come near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.
010	2SA	001	016	And David said unto him, Thy blood is upon thy own head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I myself have slain the Lord's anointed.
010	2SA	001	017	And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:
010	2SA	001	018	And he said, That the children of Judah should be taught the bow; behold it is written in the book of Yashar.
010	2SA	001	019	O beauty of Israel! upon the high places slain: how are the mighty fallen!
010	2SA	001	020	Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon; that the daughters of the Philistines may not be glad, that the daughters of the uncircumcised may not rejoice.
010	2SA	001	021	O mountains of Gilboa', no dew, nor rain be upon you, nor fields of offerings; for there the shield of the mighty was stained, the shield of Saul, as though it had not been anointed with oil.
010	2SA	001	022	From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned never back, and the sword of Saul never returned empty.
010	2SA	001	023	Saul and Jonathan, the beloved and the dear in their lives, were even in their death not divided: more than eagles were they swift, more than lions were they strong.
010	2SA	001	024	O daughters of Israel, weep for Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with beautiful dresses, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.
010	2SA	001	025	How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, on thy high places slain.
010	2SA	001	026	I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan; very dear hast thou been unto me: wonderful was thy love for me, passing the love of women.
010	2SA	001	027	How are the mighty fallen, and lost the instruments of war!
010	2SA	002	001	And it came to pass after this, that David asked counsel of the Lord, saying, Shall I go up into one of the cities of Judah? And the Lord said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.
010	2SA	002	002	So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Achino'am the Yizre'elitess, and Abigayil, Nabal's wife, the Carmelite.
010	2SA	002	003	And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household; and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.
010	2SA	002	004	And then came the men of Judah, and they anointed there David as king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, The men of Yabesh-gil'ad were those that buried Saul.
010	2SA	002	005	And David thereupon sent messengers unto the men of Yabesh-gil'ad, and said unto them, Blessed be ye of the Lord, that ye have done this kindness unto your Lord, unto Saul, and have buried him.
010	2SA	002	006	And now may the Lord deal with you in kindness and truth: and as for me also, I will requite you this good deed, because ye have done this thing.
010	2SA	002	007	And now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant men; for your lord Saul is dead; and also me have the house of Judah anointed as king over them.
010	2SA	002	008	But Abner, the son of Ner, the captain of the army of Saul, took Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Machanayim;
010	2SA	002	009	And made him king over Gil'ad, and over the Ashurites, and over Yizre'el, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.
010	2SA	002	010	Forty years old was Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, when he became king over Israel, and two years he reigned. But the house of Judah followed David.
010	2SA	002	011	And the number of days that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.
010	2SA	002	012	And there went out Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, from Machanayim to Gib'on.
010	2SA	002	013	And Joab the son of Zeruyah and the servants of David also went out, and they met together by the pool of Gib'on: and they sat down, these on the one side of the pool, and the others on the other side of the pool.
010	2SA	002	014	And Abner said to Joab, Do let the young men rise up and play before us. And Joab said, They may rise up.
010	2SA	002	015	Then they rose up and went over by number: twelve for Benjamin, and for Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.
010	2SA	002	016	And they grasped every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow's side; and they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Chelkath-hazzurim, which is by Gib'on.
010	2SA	002	017	And the battle was exceedingly fierce on that day; and Abner with the men of Israel was beaten, before the servants of David.
010	2SA	002	018	And there were at that place three sons of Zeruyah, Joab, and Abishai, and 'Asahel: and 'Asahel was as fleet of foot as any roe in the field.
010	2SA	002	019	And 'Asahel pursued after Abner; and he turned not in going to the right hand or to the left from following Abner.
010	2SA	002	020	And Abner turned round and said, Art thou 'Asahel? And he answered, I am.
010	2SA	002	021	And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay hold for thyself on one of the young men, and take thyself his armor. But 'Asahel would not turn aside from following him.
010	2SA	002	022	And Abner repeated again to say unto 'Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? and how should I then lift up my face to Joab thy brother?
010	2SA	002	023	But he refused to turn aside; and Abner smote him with the hinder end of the spear under the fifth rib, so that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died on the spot: and it came to pass, that all who came to the place where 'Asahel had fallen down and died remained standing still.
010	2SA	002	024	But Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giach on the way to the wilderness of Gib'on.
010	2SA	002	025	And the children of Benjamin assembled themselves together behind Abner, and formed one solid body, and posted themselves on the top of a certain hill.
010	2SA	002	026	And Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall for everlasting the sword devour? knowest thou not that it will be bitter in the end? and how long shall it be, ere thou wilt bid the people to return from pursuing their brethren?
010	2SA	002	027	And Joab said, As God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then already in the morning would the people have gone away every one from pursuing his brother.
010	2SA	002	028	So Joab blew the cornet, and all the people remained standing still, and pursued no more after Israel, and they continued no more to fight.
010	2SA	002	029	And Abner and his men walked through the plain all that night, and they passed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Machanayim.
010	2SA	002	030	And Joab returned from pursuing Abner; and he gathered all the people together; and there were missed of David's servants nineteen men and 'Asahel.
010	2SA	002	031	But the servants of David had smitten [many] of Benjamin, and of Abner's men: three hundred and sixty men died.
010	2SA	002	032	And they took up 'Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Beth-lechem. And Joab and his men went all that night, and the day broke on them at Hebron.
010	2SA	003	001	And the war lasted a long time between the house of Saul and the house of David; but David became continually stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul became continually weaker and weaker.
010	2SA	003	002	And there were born unto David sons in Hebron: and his first-born was Amnon, of Achino'am the Yizre'elitess;
010	2SA	003	003	And his second was Kilab, of Abigayil the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Abshalom, the son of Ma'achah the daughter of Talmai the king of Geshur;
010	2SA	003	004	And the fourth, Adoniyah, the son of Chaggith; and the fifth, Shephatyah, the son of Abital;
010	2SA	003	005	And the sixth, Yithre'am, by 'Eglah, David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.
010	2SA	003	006	And it came to pass, while the war lasted between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner upheld with all his strength the house of Saul.
010	2SA	003	007	And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Ayah: and Ish-bosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father's concubine?
010	2SA	003	008	And Abner became very wroth because of the words of Ish-bosheth, and said, Am I the chief of the dogs which belong to Judah? unto this day have I shown kindness unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David; and yet thou chargest me today with a wrong committed with this woman?
010	2SA	003	009	May God do so to Abner, and continue to do yet more to him, that, as the Lord hath sworn to David, even so will I surely do to him;
010	2SA	003	010	To transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to establish the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer-sheba'.
010	2SA	003	011	And he could not answer Abner a word more in reply, because of his fear of him.
010	2SA	003	012	And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying [also,] Make thy covenant with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring round unto thee all Israel.
010	2SA	003	013	And he said, Well: I will indeed make a covenant with thee; but one thing I require of thee, namely, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face.
010	2SA	003	014	And David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul, saying, Give up to me my wife Michal, whom I espoused to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.
010	2SA	003	015	And Ish-bosheth sent, and took her from the man, from Paltiel the son of Layish.
010	2SA	003	016	And her husband went with her going along and weeping behind her as far as Bachurim: when Abner said unto him, Go, return. And he returned.
010	2SA	003	017	And Abner had used these words with the elders of Israel, saying, Already yesterday and even before ye have been desiring David as king over you:
010	2SA	003	018	And now do it; for the Lord hath said of David thus, By the hand of my servant David will I save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.
010	2SA	003	019	And Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin; and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good in the eyes of Israel, and in the eyes of the whole house of Benjamin.
010	2SA	003	020	And Abner came to David to Hebron, and with him were twenty men; and David made for Abner and for the men that were with him a feast.
010	2SA	003	021	And Abner said unto David, I will now arise and go, and I will assemble unto my Lord the king all Israel, that they may make a covenant with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thy soul longeth for. And David dismissed Abner: and he went in peace.
010	2SA	003	022	And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a predatory excursion, and brought in much booty with them; but Abner was no more with David in Hebron; for he had dismissed him, and he was gone in peace.
010	2SA	003	023	When Joab and all the army that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath dismissed him, and he is gone in peace.
010	2SA	003	024	Then came Joab to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee: why is it that thou hast dismissed him, that he went freely away?
010	2SA	003	025	Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that to deceive thee did he come, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou art doing.
010	2SA	003	026	And Joab went out from David, and he sent messengers after Abner, who brought him back from the well of Sirah; but David knew it not.
010	2SA	003	027	And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him in private; and he smote him there under the fifth rib, and he died, for the blood of 'Asahel his brother.
010	2SA	003	028	And when David heard it afterward, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the Lord for ever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner:
010	2SA	003	029	May it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house; and may there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a crutch, or that falleth by the sword, or that lacketh bread.
010	2SA	003	030	But Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had killed their brother 'Asahel at Gib'on in the battle.
010	2SA	003	031	And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird yourselves with sackcloth, and [go] mourning before Abner. And king David walked behind the bier.
010	2SA	003	032	And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.
010	2SA	003	033	And the king lamented over Abner, and said, O, that Abner had to die, as the worthless dieth!
010	2SA	003	034	Thy hands were not bound, and thy feet were not put into fetters: as one falleth before men of wickedness art thou fallen. And all the people wept again over him.
010	2SA	003	035	And all the people came to cause David to eat food while it was yet day; but David swore, saying, So do God to me, and thus may he continue, if before the sun be down I taste bread, or the least else.
010	2SA	003	036	And all the people took notice of it, and it was pleasing in their eyes: as whatsoever the king did was pleasing in the eyes of all the people.
010	2SA	003	037	And all the people and all Israel understood on that day that it had not been of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.
010	2SA	003	038	And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that a prince and a great man hath fallen this day in Israel?
010	2SA	003	039	And I am this day yet weak, and just anointed king; and these men, the sons of Zeruyah, are too strong for me: may the Lord pay the doer of evil according to his wickedness.
010	2SA	004	001	And when Saul's son heard that Abner had died in Hebron, his hands became enfeebled, and all the Israelites were troubled.
010	2SA	004	002	And Saul's son had two men who were captains of bands; the name of the one was Ba'anah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin:
010	2SA	004	003	And the Beerothites had fled to Gittayim, and remained sojourners there until this day.)
010	2SA	004	004	And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame on both feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan from Yizre'el, and his nurse took him up and fled: and it came to pass, in her haste to flee, that he fell, and was rendered lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.
010	2SA	004	005	And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Ba'anah, went, and came at the heat of the day to the house of Ish-bosheth, who was just lying in bed as usual at noon.
010	2SA	004	006	And they came thither into the interior of the house, as buyers of wheat; and they smote him under the fifth rib: and Rechab and Ba'anah his brother escaped.
010	2SA	004	007	Namely, they came into the house, while he was lying on his bed in his sleeping-chamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and cut off his head, and took his head, and went by the way of the plain all the night.
010	2SA	004	008	And they brought the head of Ish-bosheth unto David to Hebron, and they said to the king, Behold, here is the head of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul thy enemy, who sought thy life: and the Lord hath granted to my lord the king vengeance this day on Saul, and on his seed.
010	2SA	004	009	But David answered Rechab and Ba'anah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the Lord liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,
010	2SA	004	010	When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, and he was in his own eyes as though he brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who [thought] that I should give him a reward for his tidings:
010	2SA	004	011	How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous man in his own house upon his bed? and now, behold, I will require his blood of your hand, and I will remove you away from the earth.
010	2SA	004	012	And David gave the command to the young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up by the pool in Hebron. But the head of Ish-bosheth they took, and buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.
010	2SA	005	001	Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spoke, saying, Behold us, thy bone and thy flesh are we;
010	2SA	005	002	Already yesterday, and even before, when Saul was king over us, thou wast the one that led out and brought in Israel: And the Lord said to thee, Thou shalt indeed feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a chief over Israel.
010	2SA	005	003	Thus came all the elders of Israel to the king unto Hebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the Lord: and they anointed David as king over Israel.
010	2SA	005	004	Thirty years was David old when he became king, [and] forty years he reigned.
010	2SA	005	005	In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.
010	2SA	005	006	And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land; who said unto David, as followeth, Thou shalt not come in hither, except thou [first] remove away the blind and the lame: meaning, David cannot come in hither.
010	2SA	005	007	Nevertheless David captured the strong-hold of Zion; the same is the city of David.
010	2SA	005	008	And David said on that day, Whosoever will smite the Jebusites, and reach the aqueduct and the lame and the blind, that are hateful to David's soul, —Wherefore people usually say, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.
010	2SA	005	009	And David dwelt in the fort, and he called it “The City of David.” And David built [it] round about from the Millo and inward.
010	2SA	005	010	And David went on, and became greater and greater, and the Lord the God of hosts was with him.
010	2SA	005	011	And Hiram the king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar-trees, and carpenters, and stone-masons: and they built a house for David.
010	2SA	005	012	And David felt conscious that the Lord has established him as king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel.
010	2SA	005	013	And David took yet more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron; and there were born to David yet [more] sons and daughters.
010	2SA	005	014	And these are the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem: Shammua', and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,
010	2SA	005	015	And Yibchar, and Elishua', and Nepheg, and Yaphia',
010	2SA	005	016	And Elishama', and Elyada', and Eliphelet.
010	2SA	005	017	But when the Philistines heard that the people had anointed David as king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David: and David heard of it, and went down to the strong-hold.
010	2SA	005	018	The Philistines also came and spread themselves out in the valley of Rephaim.
010	2SA	005	019	And David asked counsel of the Lord, saying, shall I go up against the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And the Lord said unto David, Go up; for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into thy hand.
010	2SA	005	020	And David came to Ba'al-perazim, and David smote them there, and said, The Lord hath broken down my enemies before me, as a breach [is made by] water. Wherefore he called the name of that place Ba'al-perazim.
010	2SA	005	021	And they left behind there their idols, and David and his men burnt them.
010	2SA	005	022	And the Philistines came up once again, and spread themselves out in the valley of Rephaim.
010	2SA	005	023	And when David asked counsel of the Lord, he said, Thou shalt not go up; but turn about and fall in the rear of them, and come upon them opposite to the mulberry-trees.
010	2SA	005	024	And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of walking on the top of the mulberry-trees, that thou shalt then bestir thyself; for then will the Lord go out before thee, to smite in the camp of the Philistines.
010	2SA	005	025	And David did so, as the Lord had commanded him; and he smote the Philistines from Geba' until thou comest to Gezer.
010	2SA	006	001	And David assembled again all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.
010	2SA	006	002	And David arose, and went with all the people who were with him from Ba'ale-yehudah, to bring up from there the ark of God, the name of which was called by the name of the Lord of hosts, that dwelleth over the cherubim.
010	2SA	006	003	And they conveyed the ark of God in a new wagon, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was on the hill; and 'Uzzah and Achyo, the sons of Abinadab, guided the new wagon.
010	2SA	006	004	When they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was on the hill, [they were] near the ark of God; but Achyo went before the ark.
010	2SA	006	005	And David and all the house of Israel played before the Lord on all manner of instruments made of fir-wood, and on harps, and on psalteries, and on tambourines, and with bells, and with cymbals.
010	2SA	006	006	And when they came to the threshing-floor of Nachon, 'Uzzah put forth [his hand] to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.
010	2SA	006	007	And the anger of the Lord was kindled against 'Uzzah; and God smote him there for the error; and he died there by the ark of God.
010	2SA	006	008	And it was grievous to David, because the Lord had suddenly taken away 'Uzzah; and he called that place Perez-'uzzah [Breach of 'Uzzah] until this day.
010	2SA	006	009	And David was afraid of the Lord on that day, and said, How shall the ark of the Lord come to me?
010	2SA	006	010	So David would not allow to have the ark of the Lord removed unto him into the city of David; but David had it carried round into the house of 'Obed-edom the Gittite.
010	2SA	006	011	And the ark of the Lord remained in the house of 'Obed-edom the Gittite three months: and the Lord blessed 'Obed-edom, and all his household.
010	2SA	006	012	And it was told to king David, saying, The Lord hath blessed the house of 'Obed-edom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of God: and David then went and brought up the ark of God from the house of 'Obed-edom into the city of David with joy.
010	2SA	006	013	And it happened, that when the bearers of the ark of the Lord had progressed six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatling.
010	2SA	006	014	And David danced with all his might before the Lord; and David was girded with a linen ephod.
010	2SA	006	015	So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the Lord with shouting, and with the sound of the cornet.
010	2SA	006	016	And it happened, as the ark of the Lord came into the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked through the window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the Lord; and she despised him in her heart.
010	2SA	006	017	And they brought in the ark of the Lord, and set it in its place, in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt-offerings before the Lord and peace-offerings.
010	2SA	006	018	And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offerings and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord of hosts.
010	2SA	006	019	And he dealt out to all the people, to the whole multitude of Israel, to both men and women, to every person one cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine: and all the people departed every one to his house.
010	2SA	006	020	And David then returned to bless his household. But Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and she said, How honored was today the king of Israel, who uncovered himself today before the eyes of the hand-maids of his servants, as only one of the low fellows can uncover himself!
010	2SA	006	021	And David said unto Michal, Before the Lord, who chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to ordain me ruler over the people of the Lord, over Israel: —yea, before the Lord will I yet farther play.
010	2SA	006	022	And should I be yet more vile than thus, and should I be base in my own eyes: yet among the maid-servants of whom thou hast spoken, yea, among them would I still be honored.
010	2SA	006	023	And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child until the day of her death.
010	2SA	007	001	And it came to pass, when the king dwelt in his house, and the Lord had given him rest round about from all his enemies;
010	2SA	007	002	That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, while the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.
010	2SA	007	003	And Nathan said to the king, all that is in thy heart go and do; for the Lord is with thee.
010	2SA	007	004	And it came to pass during that night, That the word of the Lord came unto Nathan, saying,
010	2SA	007	005	Go and say unto my servant, unto David, Thus hath said the Lord, Wilt thou indeed build me a house for my dwelling?
010	2SA	007	006	For I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even until this day; but have been moving about in a tent and in a tabernacle.
010	2SA	007	007	In all the places where I moved about among all the children of Israel, did I speak a word to any one of the tribes of Israel, whom I ordained to feed my people Israel, saying, Why have ye not built for me a house of cedar?
010	2SA	007	008	Now therefore, thus shalt thou say unto my servant, to David, Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, I took thee from the sheep-cote, from behind the flocks, to be a ruler over my people, over Israel;
010	2SA	007	009	And I have been with thee whithersoever thou didst go, and I have cut off all thy enemies from thy presence, and I have made thee a great name, like the name of the great who are on the earth;
010	2SA	007	010	And I have procured a place for my people, for Israel, and I have planted them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and be no more troubled; and that the children of wickedness shall not afflict them any more as aforetimes,
010	2SA	007	011	And [as it was] since the day that I ordained judges to be over my people Israel; and I have caused thee to rest from all thy enemies; and the Lord telleth thee that he, the Lord, will make thee a house.
010	2SA	007	012	When thy days will be completed, and thou wilt sleep with thy fathers: then will I set up thy seed after thee, who shall proceed out of thy body, and I will establish his kingdom.
010	2SA	007	013	He it is that shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever.
010	2SA	007	014	I too will be to him as a father, and he shall indeed be to me as a son: so that when he committeth iniquity, I will chastise him with the rod of men, and with the plagues of the children of man;
010	2SA	007	015	But my kindness shall not depart from him, as I caused it to depart from Saul, whom I removed from before thee.
010	2SA	007	016	And thy house and thy kingdom shall be steadfast for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.
010	2SA	007	017	In accordance with all these words, and in accordance with all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.
010	2SA	007	018	Then went king David in, and sat down before the Lord, and he said, Who am I, O Lord Eternal? and what is my house, that thou hast brought me as far as hitherward?
010	2SA	007	019	And this was yet too small a thing in thine eyes, O Lord Eternal; and thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a distant time. And is this the desert of man, O Lord Eternal?
010	2SA	007	020	And what can David add yet more to speak unto thee? since thou, O Lord Eternal, knowest well thy servant?
010	2SA	007	021	For the sake of thy word, and in accordance with thy own heart, hast thou done all this great thing, so as to let thy servant know it.
010	2SA	007	022	Therefore art thou great, O Eternal God; for there is none like thee, and there is no God beside thee, in accordance with all that we have heard with our ears.
010	2SA	007	023	And who is like thy people, like Israel, the only nation on the earth, which God went to redeem for himself as a people, and to acquire for himself a name, and to do for you this great deed, and fearful things for thy land [to drive out], from before thy people which thou hast redeemed for thyself from Egypt, nations and their gods.
010	2SA	007	024	For thou hast established for thyself thy people Israel as a people unto thee for ever; and thou, O Lord, art indeed become their God.
010	2SA	007	025	And now, O Eternal God, let the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, stand firm for ever, and do as thou hast spoken.
010	2SA	007	026	And let thy name be magnified unto everlasting, that men may say, The Lord of hosts is the God over Israel: and may the house of thy servant David be established before thee.
010	2SA	007	027	For thou, O Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, hast revealed to the ear of thy servant, saying, A house will be built up for thee; therefore hath thy servant found the heart to pray unto thee this prayer.
010	2SA	007	028	And now, O Lord Eternal, thou art the [true] God, and thy words must become the truth, and thou hast spoken unto thy servant this goodness:
010	2SA	007	029	And now let it please thee and bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee; for thou, O Lord Eternal, hast spoken it; and from thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.
010	2SA	008	001	And it came to pass after this, that David smote the Philistines, and humbled them: and David took Metheg-haammah out of the hand of the Philistines.
010	2SA	008	002	And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, laying them down on the ground; and he measured with two lines to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive. And the Moabites became David's servants, bringing presents.
010	2SA	008	003	David smote also Hadad'ezer, the son of Rechob, the king of Zobah, as he went to extend his territory at the river Euphrates.
010	2SA	008	004	And David captured from him a thousand and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand men on foot: and David hamstringed all the chariot-teams, but reserved of them a hundred chariot-teams.
010	2SA	008	005	And the Syrians of Damascus then came to aid Hadad'ezer, the king of Zobah, when David slew of the Syrians twenty and two thousand men.
010	2SA	008	006	And David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, bearing presents. And the Lord helped David whithersoever he went.
010	2SA	008	007	And David took the shields of gold that belonged to the servants of Hadad'ezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
010	2SA	008	008	And from Betach, and from Berothai, cities of Hadad'ezer, did king David take exceedingly much copper.
010	2SA	008	009	And when To'i the king of Chamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadad'ezer,
010	2SA	008	010	Then did To'i send Yoram his son unto king David, to ask him after his well-being, and to bless him, because that he had fought against Hadad'ezer, and smitten him; for Hadad'ezer had been engaged in wars with To'i; and he had in his hand vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of copper:
010	2SA	008	011	These also did king David sanctify unto the Lord, with the silver and gold that he had sanctified from all the nations which he subdued;
010	2SA	008	012	From Syria, and from Moab, and from the children of 'Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from 'Amalek, and from the spoil of Hadad'ezer, the son of Rechob, the king of Zobah.
010	2SA	008	013	And David acquired a name when he returned from his smiting the Syrians in the valley of salt, eighteen thousand men.
010	2SA	008	014	And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all the Edomites became servants to David. And the Lord helped David whithersoever he went.
010	2SA	008	015	And David reigned over all Israel; and David did what is just and right unto all his people.
010	2SA	008	016	And Joab the son of Zeruyah was over the army; and Jehoshaphat the son of Achilud was recorder;
010	2SA	008	017	And Zadok the son of Achitub, and Achimelech the son of Ebyathar, were priests; and Serayah was scribe;
010	2SA	008	018	And Banayahu the son of Yehoyada' was over both the Kerethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were officers of state.
010	2SA	009	001	And David said, Is there yet any one that is left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for the sake of Jonathan?
010	2SA	009	002	And the house of Saul had a servant whose name was Ziba; and they called him unto David; and the king said unto him, Art thou Ziba? And be said, Thy servant [is it].
010	2SA	009	003	And the king said, Is there no one left any more of the house of Saul, that I may show him the kindness of God! And Ziba said unto the king, There is yet a son of Jonathan, lame on both feet.
010	2SA	009	004	And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of 'Ammiel, in Lo-debar.
010	2SA	009	005	And king David sent, and had him taken out of the house of Machir, the son of 'Ammiel, from Lo-debar.
010	2SA	009	006	And Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came unto David, and he fell on his face, and bowed himself. And David said, Mephibosheth; And he answered, Here is thy servant!
010	2SA	009	007	And David said unto him, Fear not; for I will surely show thee kindness for the sake of Jonathan thy father, and I will restore unto thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.
010	2SA	009	008	And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant, that thou shouldst turn thy regard unto such a dead dog as I am?
010	2SA	009	009	Then called the king for Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto him, all that hath pertained to Saul and to all his house have I given unto thy master's son.
010	2SA	009	010	And thou shalt till for him the land, thou, and thy sons, and thy servants, and thou shalt bring in [the product], that thy master's son may have bread which he can eat; but Mephibosheth thy master's son shall eat continually bread at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
010	2SA	009	011	And Ziba said unto the king, In accordance with all that my Lord the king may command his servant, so will thy servant do. And Mephibosheth [said the king] shall eat at my table, as one of the king's sons.
010	2SA	009	012	And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha. And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth.
010	2SA	009	013	And Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem; for he ate continually at the king's table; and he was lame on both his feet.
010	2SA	010	001	And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of 'Ammon died, and Chanun his son reigned in his stead.
010	2SA	010	002	Then said David, I will show kindness unto Chanun the son of Nachash, as his father showed me kindness. And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David's servants came unto the land of the children of 'Ammon.
010	2SA	010	003	And the princes of the children of 'Ammon said unto Chanun their Lord, Doth David honor thy father in thy eyes, that he hath sent comforters unto thee! hath David not sent his servants unto thee, in order to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?
010	2SA	010	004	Chanun thereupon took David's servants, and shaved off the one-half of their beard, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.
010	2SA	010	005	When they told it unto David, he sent [persons] to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed; and the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beard be grown, and then return.
010	2SA	010	006	And when the children of 'Ammon saw that they were become in bad odor with David, the children of 'Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-rechob, and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand men on foot, and the king of Ma'achah with a thousand men, and of the people of Tob twelve thousand men.
010	2SA	010	007	And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the army, [and] the mighty men.
010	2SA	010	008	And the children of 'Ammon came out, and put themselves in battle-array at the entrance of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rechob, and the people of Tob and Ma'achah, were by themselves in the field.
010	2SA	010	009	When now Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind, he selected from all the chosen men of Israel, and arrayed himself against the Syrians:
010	2SA	010	010	And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, who arrayed himself against the children of 'Ammon.
010	2SA	010	011	And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then shalt thou bring me help; but if the children of 'Ammon be too strong for thee, then will I go to help thee.
010	2SA	010	012	Be strong, and let us strengthen ourselves in behalf of our people, and in behalf of the cities of our God: and may the Lord do that which seemeth good in his eyes.
010	2SA	010	013	And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto the battle against the Syrians; and they fled from before him.
010	2SA	010	014	And when the children of 'Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, then did they also fly before Abishai, and entered into the city. Joab then returned from the children of 'Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.
010	2SA	010	015	And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel, they gathered themselves altogether.
010	2SA	010	016	And Hadar'ezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river, and they came to Chelam; and Shobach the captain of the army of Hadar'ezer went before them.
010	2SA	010	017	And when it was told to David, he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came to Chelam. And the Syrians set themselves in battle-array against David, and fought with him.
010	2SA	010	018	And the Syrians fled from before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians [the men] of seven hundred chariots, and forty thousand horsemen; and Shobach also the captain of their army he smote, and he died there.
010	2SA	010	019	And when all the kings, the vassals to Hadar'ezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them: and the Syrians feared to help the children of 'Ammon any more.
010	2SA	011	001	And it came to pass, at the return of the same season of the year, at the time when kings go forth, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of 'Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David remained behind at Jerusalem.
010	2SA	011	002	And it happened at evening-tide, that David arose from off his couch, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and he saw from the roof a woman bathing herself; and the woman was of a very beautiful appearance.
010	2SA	011	003	And David sent and inquired after the woman; and some one said, Behold, this is Beth-sheba', the daughter of Eli'am, the wife of Uriyah the Hittite.
010	2SA	011	004	And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her, and she had just purified herself from her uncleanness; and she returned unto her house.
010	2SA	011	005	And the woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, I am with child.
010	2SA	011	006	And David sent to Joab, Send unto me Uriyah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriyah to David.
010	2SA	011	007	And when Uriyah was come unto him, David asked after the well-being of Joab, and after the well-being of the people, and how the war prospered.
010	2SA	011	008	And David said to Uriyah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriyah went forth out of the king's house, and there followed him a mess of food from the king.
010	2SA	011	009	But Uriyah laid himself down at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.
010	2SA	011	010	And they told David, saying, Uriyah is not gone down unto his house: and David said unto Uriyah, Art thou not come from a journey? why then art thou not gone down unto thy own house?
010	2SA	011	011	Then said Uriyah unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah abide in booths; and my Lord Joab and the servants of my Lord are encamped in the open field: and should I alone go unto my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.
010	2SA	011	012	And David said unto Uriyah, Tarry here also this day, and tomorrow will I send thee off. So Uriyah remained in Jerusalem on that day and the following.
010	2SA	011	013	And David invited him, and he ate and drank before him, and he made him drunken; and he went out in the evening to lie down on his resting-place with the servants of his lord; but to his house he did not go down.
010	2SA	011	014	And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriyah.
010	2SA	011	015	And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set Uriyah in front, opposite to the hottest fight, and then withdraw from behind him, that he may be smitten and die.
010	2SA	011	016	And it came to pass, when Joab was enclosing the city, that he placed Uriyah toward the spot of which he knew that valiant men were there.
010	2SA	011	017	And the men of the city went out and fought with Joab; and there fell some of the people, of the servants of David, and there died also Uriyah the Hittite.
010	2SA	011	018	Then did Joab send, and told unto David all the events of the war.
010	2SA	011	019	And he charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast finished telling all the events of the war to the king,
010	2SA	011	020	And it happen that the king's wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore did you approach unto the city to fight? knew ye not, that they would shoot down from off the wall?
010	2SA	011	021	Who smote Abimelech the son of Yerubbesheth? did not a woman throw down upon him a piece of an upper mill-stone from off the wall so that he died at Thebez? why did ye approach unto the wall? then must thou say, Also thy servant Uriyah the Hittite is dead.
010	2SA	011	022	And the messenger went, and came and told unto David all for which Joab had sent him.
010	2SA	011	023	And the messenger said unto David, Because the men overpowered us and came out against us into the field; but we set upon them, as far as the entrance of the gate.
010	2SA	011	024	And the archers then shot at thy servants from off the wall; and there died some of the servants of the king, and also thy servant Uriyah the Hittite is dead.
010	2SA	011	025	Then said David to the messenger, Thus shalt thou say to Joab, Let this thing not be displeasing in thy eyes; for at times this, at other times the other will the sword devour; continue firmly in thy war against the city, and overthrow it: and thus do thou encourage him.
010	2SA	011	026	And when the wife of Uriyah heard that Uriyah her husband had died, she mourned for her lord.
010	2SA	011	027	And when the [time of] mourning was past, David sent and took her to his house, and she became his wife; and she bore him a son. But the thing which David had done was displeasing in the eyes of the Lord.
010	2SA	012	001	And the Lord sent Nathan unto David, and he came unto him and said to him, Two men were once in one city, the one rich and the other poor.
010	2SA	012	002	The rich man had flocks and herds, in great abundance.
010	2SA	012	003	But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe, which he had bought; and he nourished it, and it grew up with him and with his children together; of his bread it used to eat, and out of his cup it used to drink, and in his bosom it used to lie, and it was to him as a daughter.
010	2SA	012	004	And there came a traveler unto the rich man; and he felt compunction to take from his own flocks and from his own herds to dress for the wayfarer that was come to him; but he took the ewe of the poor man, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.
010	2SA	012	005	And the anger of David was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the Lord liveth, surely the man that hath done this deserveth to die;
010	2SA	012	006	And the ewe he shall pay fourfold, for punishment that he hath done this thing, and because he had no compassion.
010	2SA	012	007	Then said Nathan to David, Thou art the man! Thus hath said the Lord, the God of Israel, It is I who anointed thee as king over Israel, and it is I who delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;
010	2SA	012	008	And I gave unto thee the house of thy master, and [put] the wives of thy master into thy bosom, and gave unto thee the house of Israel and Judah: and if this be too little, I could bestow on thee yet many more like these things.
010	2SA	012	009	Wherefore hast thou despised the word of the Lord to do what is evil in his eyes? Uriyah the Hittite hast thou smitten with the sword, and his wife hast thou taken unto thee for wife; but him hast thou slain with the sword of the children of 'Ammon.
010	2SA	012	010	And now, the sword shall not depart from thy house for ever; for the reason that thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriyah the Hittite to be thy wife.
010	2SA	012	011	Thus hath said the Lord, Behold, I will raise up against thee evil out of thy own house, and I will take away thy wives before thy eyes, and I will give them unto thy neighbor; and he shall lie with thy wives before the face of this sun.
010	2SA	012	012	For thou hast done it in secret; but I will surely do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.
010	2SA	012	013	Then said David unto Nathan, I have sinned against the Lord. And Nathan said to David, Also the Lord hath caused thy sin to pass away: thou shalt not die.
010	2SA	012	014	Nevertheless, because thou hast given great cause to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme through this thing, the child also that hath been born unto thee shall surely die.
010	2SA	012	015	And Nathan went to his house; and the Lord struck the child that Uriyah's wife had born unto David, that it became very sick.
010	2SA	012	016	And David besought God in behalf of the lad; and David kept a fast, and came home, and lay over night upon the earth.
010	2SA	012	017	And the elders of the house arose about him, to raise him up from the earth; but he would not, and he did not partake of any bread with them.
010	2SA	012	018	And it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died; and the servants of David were afraid to tell him, that the child was dead; for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he would not hearken to our voice: how then shall we say to him, The child is dead! he might do [himself] a hurt.
010	2SA	012	019	But when David saw that his servants were whispering to each other, David understood that the child was dead; wherefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? and they said, he is dead.
010	2SA	012	020	David then rose up from the earth, and washed and anointed himself, and changed his garments, and went into the house of the Lord and prostrated himself; and then he came to his own house, and asked that they should set food before him, and he ate.
010	2SA	012	021	And his servants then said unto him, What is this thing which thou hast done? On account of the child when living thou didst fast and weep; but as soon as the child was dead thou didst arise and eat bread!
010	2SA	012	022	And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept; because I said, Who knoweth, but that the Lord will be gracious to me, that the child may live?
010	2SA	012	023	But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast then? can I restore him again? I am going to him; but he will not return to me.
010	2SA	012	024	And David comforted Bath-sheba' his wife, and he went in unto her, and lay with her; and she bore a son, and called his name Solomon; and the Lord loved him.
010	2SA	012	025	And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet, and called his name, Yedideyah in behalf of the Lord.
010	2SA	012	026	And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of 'Ammon, and captured the royal city.
010	2SA	012	027	And Joab sent messengers to David; and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have also captured the water-town.
010	2SA	012	028	And now gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and capture it: lest I capture the city myself, and it be called by my name.
010	2SA	012	029	And David gathered all the people together and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and captured it.
010	2SA	012	030	And he took the crown of Malkam from off his head, and its weight was a talent of gold, and [on it was] a precious stone, and it was set on the head of David; and the booty of the city he brought out in great abundance.
010	2SA	012	031	And the people that were therein he brought forward, and put them under saws, and under iron threshing-wagons, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through brick-kilns; and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of 'Ammon: and David returned with them with all the people unto Jerusalem.
010	2SA	013	001	And it came to pass after this, that Abshalom the son of David had a handsome sister, whose name was Thamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.
010	2SA	013	002	And Amnon worried himself so that he fell sick on account of Thamar his sister; for she was a virgin; and it was impossible in the eyes of Amnon to do her the least [harm].
010	2SA	013	003	But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Yonadab, the son of Shim'ah, David's brother; and Yonadab was a very sensible man.
010	2SA	013	004	And he said to him, Why art thou so wasted, O prince, morning after morning? Wilt thou not tell me? Then said Amnon to him, Thamar the sister of Abshalom my brother do I love.
010	2SA	013	005	And Yonadab said to him, Lie down on thy couch, and feign thyself sick; and when thy father cometh to see thee, thou must say unto him, Let, I pray thee, Thamar my sister come, and give me some food, and prepare the refreshment before my eyes, in order that I may see it, and eat it out of her hand.
010	2SA	013	006	So Amnon lay down, and feigned himself sick; and when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, Let, I pray thee, Thamar my sister come, and mix up before my eyes a couple of cakes, that I may enjoy them out of her hand.
010	2SA	013	007	Then did David send home to Thamar, saying, Do go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and prepare for him the refreshment.
010	2SA	013	008	So Thamar went to the house of Amnon her brother, and he was lying down; and she took the dough and kneaded, and mixed it up before his eyes, and baked the cakes;
010	2SA	013	009	And she took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat; and Amnon said, Cause every man to go out from me; and they went out, every man, from him.
010	2SA	013	010	And Amnon said to Thamar, Bring the refreshment into the chamber, that I may enjoy it out of thy hand. So Thamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them unto Amnon her brother into the chamber.
010	2SA	013	011	And when she had brought them near unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come, lie with me, my sister.
010	2SA	013	012	But she said to him, No, my brother, do not violate me; for such a deed ought not to be done in Israel; do not this scandalous act!
010	2SA	013	013	And I, whither should I carry my shame? and as for thee, thou wouldst be like one of the worthless in Israel; but now, O speak, I pray thee, unto the king, for he will not withhold me from thee.
010	2SA	013	014	Nevertheless, he would not hearken unto her voice; but he overpowered her, and violated her, and lay with her.
010	2SA	013	015	Then did Amnon hate her with a very great hatred; so that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her; and Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.
010	2SA	013	016	And she said unto him, [Do] not add this yet greater wrong than the other which thou hast done with me, to send me [now] away! But he would not listen to her;
010	2SA	013	017	And he called his young man, his servant, and said, Do send this woman away from me, into the street, and lock the door behind her.
010	2SA	013	018	And she had on a garment of divers colors; for thus were usually appareled the king's daughters when virgins, in robes; and his servant brought her out into the street, and locked the door behind her.
010	2SA	013	019	And Thamar put ashes on her head, and the garment of divers colors which was on her she rent: and she placed her hand on her head, and went away and cried as she went along.
010	2SA	013	020	Then said to her Abshalom her brother, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but now, my sister, keep silence, he is thy brother, take this thing not to thy heart. So Thamar remained, and was secluded in the house of Abshalom her brother.
010	2SA	013	021	And when king David heard all these things, it displeased him greatly.
010	2SA	013	022	And Abshalom spoke not with Amnon either bad or good; for Abshalom hated Amnon, because he had violated Thamar his sister.
010	2SA	013	023	And it came to pass after two full years, that Abshalom had sheep-shearers at Ba'al-chazor, which is near Ephraim; and Abshalom invited all the king's sons.
010	2SA	013	024	And Abshalom came to the king, and said, Behold, now, thy servant hath sheep-shearers; let the king, I pray thee, and his servants go with thy servant.
010	2SA	013	025	And the king said to Abshalom, No, my son, do not let us all go now, that we may not be a burden upon thee. And he urged him much, but he would not go, and he blessed him.
010	2SA	013	026	And Abshalom said, If not, let, I pray thee, Amnon my brother go with us. And the king said to him, Why should he go with thee?
010	2SA	013	027	But Abshalom urged him greatly, and he sent with him Amnon and all the sons of the king.
010	2SA	013	028	Now Abshalom commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye, I pray you, when Annon's heart is merry with wine, and I say unto you, Smite Amnon: then kill him, fear not; behold, it is I who command it you; be firm and show yourselves men of valor.
010	2SA	013	029	And the servants of Abshalom did unto Amnon as Abshalom had commanded. Then arose all the king's sons, and they rode off, every man on his mule, and fled.
010	2SA	013	030	And it happened, while they were on the way, that the report came to David, saying, Abshalom hath smitten all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.
010	2SA	013	031	Then arose the king and rent his garments, and laid himself on the earth: and all his servants were standing by with their garments rent.
010	2SA	013	032	But Yonadab the son of Shim'ah, David's brother, commenced and said, Let not my Lord suppose that they have slain all the young men, the king's sons; since Amnon alone is dead; for by the command of Abshalom was this ordained from the day that he violated Thamar his sister.
010	2SA	013	033	And now let not my Lord the king take the thing to his heart, thinking, that all the king's sons are dead; for Amnon alone is dead.
010	2SA	013	034	And Abshalom flew away. And the young man that was watching lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, many people were coming by the way behind him, by the side of the mount.
010	2SA	013	035	And Yonadab said to the king, The king's sons are come: according to the word of thy servant, so hath it come to pass.
010	2SA	013	036	And it happened, as he had just finished speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and they lifted up their voice and wept; and also the king and all his servants wept very much.
010	2SA	013	037	But Abshalom had fled; and he went to Talmai, the son of 'Ammihud, the king of Geshur: and [David] mourned for his son all the time.
010	2SA	013	038	So did Abshalom fly, and go to Geshur, and he remained there three years.
010	2SA	013	039	And [the soul of] king David longed to go forth unto Abshalom; for he was comforted concerning Amnon, that he was dead.
010	2SA	014	001	And when now Joab the son of Zeruyah perceived that the heart of the king was [turned] toward Abshalom:
010	2SA	014	002	Then sent Joab to Tekoa', and he fetched thence a wise woman, and said to her, Feign. I pray thee, as though thou mournest, and do put on mourning garments, and anoint thyself not with oil; but be as a woman that hath these many days been mourning for the dead.
010	2SA	014	003	And thou must come to the king and speak with him after these words: and Joab put the words into her mouth.
010	2SA	014	004	And the woman from Tekoa' spoke to the king, and fell on her face to the ground, and bowed herself, and said, Help, O king!
010	2SA	014	005	And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she said, Truly, I am a widow-woman; since my husband is dead.
010	2SA	014	006	And thy hand-maid had two sons, and they two quarreled together in the field, and there was no one between them to help [either]; so the one smote the other, and slew him.
010	2SA	014	007	And, behold, the whole family is risen up against thy handmaid, and they said, Give up the slayer of his brother, that we may have him put to death, for the life of his brother whom he hath killed; and we will destroy also the heir: and thus they will quench my coal which is remaining, so as not to allow to my husband either name or remainder upon the face of the earth.
010	2SA	014	008	And the king said unto the woman, Go to thy house, and I will issue [my] charge concerning thee.
010	2SA	014	009	Then said the woman of Tekoa unto the king, On me, my Lord, O king, be the iniquity, and on my father's house: and may the king and his throne be guiltless.
010	2SA	014	010	And the king said, Whosoever speaketh aught unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.
010	2SA	014	011	Then said she, Let the king, I pray thee, remember the Lord thy God, so as not to suffer the avenger of the blood to cause yet more destruction, and that they may not destroy my son. And he said, As the Lord liveth, there shall not fall one hair of thy son to the earth.
010	2SA	014	012	Then said the woman, Let thy hand-maid, I pray thee, speak unto my Lord the king one word. And he said, Speak on.
010	2SA	014	013	And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God? and since the king doth speak this thing, he is as a guilty man, if the king do not permit his banished one to return home.
010	2SA	014	014	For we must needs die, and are as water which is spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; and yet doth God not take away life; and he deviseth thoughts, so that the banished one may not remain banished from him.
010	2SA	014	015	And now that I am come to speak unto my Lord the king of this thing, [happened] because the people made me afraid; and therefore thy hand-maid said, I will still speak unto the king; perhaps the king may act [in accordance with] the word of his hand-maid.
010	2SA	014	016	For the king may hear [me], to deliver his hand-maid out of the hand of the man [that desireth] to exterminate me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.
010	2SA	014	017	And thy hand-maid said, May the word of my Lord the king now become [the means of giving] repose; for as an angel of God, so is my Lord the king to comprehend the good and the bad: and may the Lord thy God be with thee.
010	2SA	014	018	Then answered the king and said unto the woman, Conceal not, I pray thee, from me a word concerning what I am going to ask thee. And the woman said, Let my Lord the king but speak.
010	2SA	014	019	And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my Lord, O king! none can turn to the right or to the left from all that my Lord the king hath spoken; for it was thy servant Joab who hath bidden me, and it was he that hath put in the mouth of thy hand-maid all these words.
010	2SA	014	020	In order to change the appearance of the matter hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my Lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all that is [done] on the earth.
010	2SA	014	021	And the king said unto Joab, Behold, now, thou hast done this thing: go then, bring back the young man Abshalom.
010	2SA	014	022	And Joab fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself, and blessed the king: and Joab said, Today is thy servant convinced that I have found grace in thy eyes, my Lord, O king; since the king hath acted in accordance with the word of thy servant.
010	2SA	014	023	And Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Abshalom to Jerusalem.
010	2SA	014	024	And the king said, Let him repair to his own house, but my face he shall not see. So Abshalom repaired to his own house, but the king's face he did not see.
010	2SA	014	025	And like Abshalom there was no man as handsome in all Israel, so that he was greatly praised: from the sole of his foot up to the crown of his head there was no blemish on him.
010	2SA	014	026	And when he shaved off [the hair of] his head [and it was at the end of every year that he shaved it off; because it was too heavy on him, so that he had to shave it off:] he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels by the king's weight.
010	2SA	014	027	And there was born unto Abshalom three sons and one daughter, whose name was Thamar: this one was a woman of handsome appearance.
010	2SA	014	028	And Abshalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and the king's face he did not see.
010	2SA	014	029	Abshalom sent out therefore for Joab, to send him to the king; but he would not come to him: and he sent again the second time; but he would not come.
010	2SA	014	030	He thereupon said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is alongside of mine, and he hath barley there: go and set it on fire. And Abshalom's servants set the field on fire.
010	2SA	014	031	Then did Joab arise, and he went to Abshalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set the field belonging to me on fire?
010	2SA	014	032	And Abshalom said to Joab, Behold, I had sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it would be better for me were I yet there: and now let me see the king's face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him put me to death.
010	2SA	014	033	So Joab went to the king, and told it to him: and he called for Abshalom, who came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king; and the king kissed Abshalom.
010	2SA	015	001	And it came to pass after this, that Abshalom provided for himself a chariot and horses, and fifty men who ran before him.
010	2SA	015	002	And Abshalom rose up early, and stood on the side of the way to the gate: and it happened, that whenever a man who had a controversy came to the king for judgment, Abshalom called to him, and said, From what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is from one of the tribes of Israel.
010	2SA	015	003	And Abshalom said unto him, See, thy words are good and right; but no one listeneth to thee on the part of the king.
010	2SA	015	004	And Abshalom said, Oh, if there were but one to appoint me judge in the land, so that every man who may have any controversy or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!
010	2SA	015	005	And it happened, that when a man came nigh to bow down to him, he used to put forth his hand, and laid hold of him, and kissed him.
010	2SA	015	006	And Abshalom did after this manner to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: and thus did Abshalom steal the heart of the men of Israel.
010	2SA	015	007	And it came to pass at the end of forty years, that Abshalom said unto the king, Let me go, I pray thee, and fulfill my vow, which I have vowed unto the Lord, at Hebron.
010	2SA	015	008	For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the Lord will ever bring me back again to Jerusalem, then will I serve the Lord.
010	2SA	015	009	And the king said unto him, Go in peace: and he arose, and went to Hebron.
010	2SA	015	010	But Abshalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, When ye hear the sound of the cornet, then shall ye say, Abshalom is become king at Hebron.
010	2SA	015	011	And with Abshalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, who were invited, and going in their simplicity; and they knew of nothing whatever.
010	2SA	015	012	And Abshalom sent for Achithophel the Gilomite, David's counsellor, from his city, from Giloh, while he offered the sacrifices. And the conspiracy became strong; and the people increased continually with Abshalom.
010	2SA	015	013	And there came a news-bearer to David, saying, the heart of the men of Israel is turned after Abshalom.
010	2SA	015	014	And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for there will not [else] be any escape for us from Abshalom: make haste, to depart, lest he make haste and overtake us suddenly and overwhelm us with evil, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.
010	2SA	015	015	And the king's servants said unto the king, In accordance with all that my Lord the king may choose, are thy servants ready.
010	2SA	015	016	And the king went forth, and all his household in his train. And the king left behind ten women, who were concubines, to guard the house.
010	2SA	015	017	And the king went forth, and all the people in his train, and tarried in a place that was far off.
010	2SA	015	018	And all his servants passed on alongside of him, and all the Kerethites, and all the Pelethites; and all the Gittites, six hundred men, who were come in his train from Gath, passed on before the king.
010	2SA	015	019	Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore wilt thou also go with us? turn back and abide with the king; for thou art a stranger, and also an exile from thy place.
010	2SA	015	020	Yesterday thou camest; and today should I move thee about with us to wander? seeing that I go whither I may: return thou, and take back thy brethren with thee, in kindness and truth.
010	2SA	015	021	And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the Lord liveth, and as my Lord the king liveth, surely in whatever place my Lord the king may be, whether for death or for life, even there will thy servant be.
010	2SA	015	022	And David said then to Ittai, Go and pass on. And Ittai the Gittite passed on, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.
010	2SA	015	023	And all the [people of the] country wept with a loud voice, as all the people passed on: and the king passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, along the way to the wilderness.
010	2SA	015	024	And lo, Zadok also, and all the Levites with him, were bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set down the ark of God; and Ebyathar went up, until all the people had finished passing out of the city.
010	2SA	015	025	And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city; if I shall find favor in the eyes of the Lord, he will bring me back again, and show me both it, and his dwelling;
010	2SA	015	026	But if he should thus say, I have no delight in thee: here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good in his eyes.
010	2SA	015	027	The king said also unto Zadok the priest, If thou see the justice of this, return to the city in peace: and your two sons, Achima'az thy son, and Jonathan the son of Ebyathar, are with you.
010	2SA	015	028	See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to bring me news.
010	2SA	015	029	Zadok therefore and Ebyathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they remained there.
010	2SA	015	030	And David went up by the ascent of the mount of Olives, weeping as he went up, and had his head covered, and he was walking barefoot: and all the people that were with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.
010	2SA	015	031	And some one told David, saying, Achithophel is among the conspirators with Abshalom. And David said, I pray thee, turn into foolishness the counsel of Achithophel, O Lord!
010	2SA	015	032	And it came to pass, that, when David was come to the top, where he used to bow himself down to God, behold, Chushai the Arkite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head.
010	2SA	015	033	And David said unto him, If thou passest on with me, thou wouldst be a burden unto me;
010	2SA	015	034	But if thou shouldst return to the city, and say unto Abshalom, Thy servant will I be, O king; thy father's servant have I been this long time past, and now will I also be thy servant: then mightest thou defeat for me the counsel of Achithophel.
010	2SA	015	035	And, behold, thou hast with thee there Zadok and Ebyathar the priests; therefore shall it be, that what thing soever thou mayest hear out of the king's house, shalt thou tell to Zadok and Ebyathar the priests.
010	2SA	015	036	Behold, they have there with them their two sons. Achima'az for Zadok, and Jonathan for Ebyathar: and ye shall send by means of them unto me whatever thing ye can hear.
010	2SA	015	037	So Chushai, David's friend, came into the city, as Abshalom had just resolved to enter into Jerusalem.
010	2SA	016	001	And when David was passed a little beyond the top [of the mount], behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth came toward him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred bunches of raisins, and a hundred [cakes] of dried figs, and a bottle of wine.
010	2SA	016	002	And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou with these? And Ziba said, The asses are for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and the dried figs for the young men to eat; and the wine to drink for such as may be faint in the wilderness.
010	2SA	016	003	And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he remaineth at Jerusalem; for he said, Today will the house of Israel restore unto me the kingdom of my father.
010	2SA	016	004	Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine shall be all that pertaineth unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I prostrate myself; let me but find grace in thy eyes, my Lord, O king.
010	2SA	016	005	And when King David came as far as Bachurim, behold, there came out thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shim'i, the son of Gera, coming forth, and cursing.
010	2SA	016	006	And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right and on his left.
010	2SA	016	007	And thus said Shim'i as he cursed, Away, away, thou man of blood, and thou worthless man!
010	2SA	016	008	The Lord hath brought back upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou didst reign; and the Lord hath placed the kingdom into the hand of Abshalom thy son; and, behold, thou art now in thy misfortune, because a man of blood art thou.
010	2SA	016	009	Then said Abishai the son of Zeruyah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my Lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and remove his head.
010	2SA	016	010	And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruyah? so let him curse; because the Lord hath said unto him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so?
010	2SA	016	011	And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, who hath come forth out of my own body, seeketh my life: how much more now this Benjamite? let him alone, and let him curse; for the Lord hath said it to him.
010	2SA	016	012	Perhaps the Lord will look on my affliction, and the Lord will requite me good instead of his cursing this day.
010	2SA	016	013	And David and his men went [thus] on the way. And Shim'i went on the side of the mount opposite to him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones toward him, and cast dust.
010	2SA	016	014	And the king, and all the people that were with him, arrived weary, and refreshed themselves there.
010	2SA	016	015	And Abshalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Achithophel [also] with him.
010	2SA	016	016	And it came to pass, when Chushai the Arkite, David's friend, was come unto Abshalom, that Chushai said unto Abshalom, Long live the king! Long live the king!
010	2SA	016	017	And Abshalom said to Chushai, Is this thy kindness for thy friend? why art thou not gone with thy friend?
010	2SA	016	018	And Chushai said unto Abshalom, No; but whom the Lord, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him will I remain.
010	2SA	016	019	And secondly, who is it whom I shall serve? is it not in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence.
010	2SA	016	020	Then said Abshalom to Achithophel, Hold counsel among yourselves as to what we shall do.
010	2SA	016	021	And Achithophel said unto Abshalom, Go in unto thy father's concubines, whom he hath left to guard the house; and all Israel will hear that thou art in bad odor with thy father: and then will the hands of all that are with thee become strong.
010	2SA	016	022	So they spread for Abshalom a tent upon the roof; and Abshalom went in unto his father's concubines before the eyes of all Israel.
010	2SA	016	023	And the counsel of Achithophel, which he counseled in those days, was as if a man had asked advice of the word of God: so was all the counsel of Achithophel both with David and with Abshalom.
010	2SA	017	001	Moreover Achithophel said unto Abshalom, Do let me now select twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night;
010	2SA	017	002	And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak-handed, and will terrify him; so that all the people that are with him will flee; and I will smite the king alone;
010	2SA	017	003	And I will bring back all the people unto thee: when all return [except] the man whom thou seekest, all the people will be in peace.
010	2SA	017	004	And the thing was pleasing in the eyes of Abshalom, and in the eyes of all the elders of Israel.
010	2SA	017	005	Then said Abshalom, Do call now also Chushai the Arkite, and let us hear what he likewise beareth in his mouth.
010	2SA	017	006	And when Chushai was come to Abshalom, Abshalom said unto him, as followeth, Such words as these hath Achithophel spoken: shall we do after his words? if not, do thou speak.
010	2SA	017	007	And Chushai said unto Abshalom, The counsel that Achithophel hath given at this time is not good.
010	2SA	017	008	And Chushai said, Thou well knowest thy father and his men, that they are mighty men, and are of an embittered spirit, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is also a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.
010	2SA	017	009	Behold, he is now hidden in some one of the pits, or in some one of the [other] places: and it will come to pass, when some of them should fall at the first onset, that whosoever heareth it would say, There hath been slaughter among the people that follow Abshalom.
010	2SA	017	010	And he also that is most valiant, whose heart is as the heart of the lion, would become quite discouraged; for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they who are with him are valiant persons.
010	2SA	017	011	But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together unto thee, from Dan even to Beer-sheba', like the sand that is by the sea in multitude: while thou in thy own person goest into the fight.
010	2SA	017	012	And when we come upon him in some one of the places where he may be found, we will encamp around him as the dew falleth on the earth: and there shall not be left of him and of all the men that are with him so much as one.
010	2SA	017	013	And if he should withdraw into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will drag it into the stream, until there be not found there even one small stone.
010	2SA	017	014	And Abshalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Chushai the Arkite is better than the counsel of Achithophel. But the Lord had ordained to frustrate the good counsel of Achithophel, to the intent that the Lord might bring the evil upon Abshalom.
010	2SA	017	015	Then said Chushai unto Zadok and to Ebyathar the priests, Thus and thus did Achithophel counsel Abshalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counseled.
010	2SA	017	016	Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but rather pass over at once; lest the king be entirely ruined, and all the people that are with him.
010	2SA	017	017	Now Jonathan and Achima'az were staying by 'En-rogel; and a maid-servant had to go and tell them, that they should go and tell king David; for they dared not be seen to come into the city.
010	2SA	017	018	Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told it to Abshalom; but they went, both of them, quickly away, and came to the house of a man in Bachurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down thither.
010	2SA	017	019	And the wife took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and scattered ground corn thereupon; so that nothing was perceived.
010	2SA	017	020	And Abshalom's servants came to the woman into the house, and they said, Where are Achima'az and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They are passed over the brook of water. And they sought, but could not find them; and they returned to Jerusalem.
010	2SA	017	021	And it came to pass, after they were gone, that they came up out of the well, and went and told it to king David, and they said unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water; for thus hath Achithophel counseled against you.
010	2SA	017	022	Then did David arise, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over the Jordan: by the time the morning was light, not even one was lacking who had not passed over the Jordan.
010	2SA	017	023	And when Achithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled the ass, and arose, and went home to his house, to his city, and gave his charge to his household, and hanged himself; and he died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.
010	2SA	017	024	Then came David to Machanayim: and Abshalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.
010	2SA	017	025	And Abshalom placed 'Amassa instead of Joab as captain over the army: and 'Amassa was the son of a man, whose name was Yithra the Israelite, who had gone in to Abigal the daughter of Nachash, the sister of Zeruyah Joab's mother.
010	2SA	017	026	And Israel and Abshalom encamped in the land of Gil'ad.
010	2SA	017	027	And it came to pass, when David was come to Machanayim, that Shobi the son of Nachash of Rabbah of the children of 'Ammon, and Machir the son of 'Ammiel of Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gil'adite of Rogelim,
010	2SA	017	028	Brought beds, and bowls, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentils, and parched pulse,
010	2SA	017	029	And honey, and cream, and sheep, and cow's cheese, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat; for they said, The people are hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.
010	2SA	018	001	And David numbered the people that were with him, and he set over them captains of thousands and captains of hundreds.
010	2SA	018	002	And David sent forth the people a third part under the command of Joab, and a third part under the command of Abishai the son of Zeruyah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the command of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I myself also will without fail go forth with you.
010	2SA	018	003	But the people said, Thou shalt not go forth; for if we should have to flee away, they will not care for us; and if half of us die, they will not care for us; for now thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou shouldst be a succor to us out of the city.
010	2SA	018	004	And the king said unto them, What seemeth good in your eyes will I do. And the king placed himself by the side of the gate, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.
010	2SA	018	005	And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, with Abshalom. And all the people heard when the king charged all the captains with respect to Abshalom.
010	2SA	018	006	So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle took place in the forest of Ephraim.
010	2SA	018	007	And the people of Israel were smitten there before David's servants, and the slaughter was great there on that day—twenty thousand men.
010	2SA	018	008	And the battle became extended there over the face of all the country: and the forest devoured yet more of the people than the sword had devoured on that day.
010	2SA	018	009	And Abshalom happened to come before the servants of David. And Abshalom was riding upon a mule, and the mule came under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was left hanging between the heaven and the earth: and the mule that was under him passed on.
010	2SA	018	010	And a certain man saw, and told it to Joab, and said, Behold, I have seen Abshalom hanging on an oak.
010	2SA	018	011	And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest him: why then didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and it would have been obligatory on me to give thee ten shekels of silver and a girdle.
010	2SA	018	012	And the man said unto Joab, And though I should weigh on my hands a thousand shekels of silver, I would not stretch forth my hand against the king's son; for before our ears did the king charge thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Take heed, whoever it be, of the young man, of Abshalom.
010	2SA	018	013	Or should I even have acted with falsehood against my own life, since there is no matter which can be hidden from the king; thou wouldst surely have placed thyself aloof.
010	2SA	018	014	Then said Joab, I will not wait thus before thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them into the heart of Abshalom, who was yet alive in the midst of the oak.
010	2SA	018	015	And ten young men, Joab's armor-bearers, encompassed and smote Abshalom, and slew him.
010	2SA	018	016	And Joab blew the cornet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab restrained the people.
010	2SA	018	017	And they took Abshalom, and cast him down in the forest, into the large pit, and erected upon him a very great heap of stones: and all Israel fled, every one, to his tents.
010	2SA	018	018	Now Abshalom had taken and reared up for himself in his lifetime, the pillar, which is in the king's dale; for he said, I have no son, so as to keep my name in remembrance; and he called the pillar after his own name: and it was called Abshalom's monument, even until this day.
010	2SA	018	019	And Achima'az the son of Zadok said, Do let me run, I pray thee, and bear the king tidings, that the Lord hath done him justice from the power of his enemies.
010	2SA	018	020	And Joab said unto him, Thou art not the man to bear [good] tidings this day, and thou shalt bear tidings another day; but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.
010	2SA	018	021	Then said Joab to the Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen, And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.
010	2SA	018	022	Then said Achima'az the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, Be it as it may, let me, I pray thee, run also after the Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore is it that thou wilt run, my son, seeing that thou hast no profitable tidings?
010	2SA	018	023	But be it as it may, let me run. And he said unto him, Run. And Achima'az ran by the way of the plain, and passed the Cushi.
010	2SA	018	024	And David was sitting between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate, upon the wall, and as he lifted up his eyes, he saw, and behold, a man was running alone.
010	2SA	018	025	And the watchman cried, and told it to the king. And the king said, If he be alone, there are tidings in his mouth. And he came nearer and nearer continually.
010	2SA	018	026	And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the gate-keeper, and said, Behold, here is a man running alone. And the king said, Also this one bringeth tidings.
010	2SA	018	027	And the watchman said, I regard the running of the foremost as the running of Achima'az the son of Zadok. And the king said, That is a good man, and with good tidings must he come.
010	2SA	018	028	And Achima'az called, and said unto the king, Peace. And he prostrated himself to the king with his face to the earth, and said, Blessed be the Lord thy God, who hath surrendered the men that had lifted up their hand against my Lord the king.
010	2SA	018	029	And the king said, Is the young man Abshalom safe? And Achima'az answered, I saw the greatest crowd when Joab sent off the king's servant, and thy servant; but I know not what hath happened.
010	2SA	018	030	And the king said, Turn aside, place thyself here. And he turned aside, and remained standing.
010	2SA	018	031	And, behold, the Cushi came [next]; and the Cushi said, Let my lord the king receive the tidings, that the Lord hath done thee justice this day from the power of all those that had risen up against thee.
010	2SA	018	032	And the king said unto the Cushi, Is the young man Abshalom safe? And the Cushi answered, May like the young man be the enemies of my Lord the king, and all that have risen up against thee for evil.
010	2SA	018	033	And the king was much moved, and he went up to the upper chamber of the gate, and wept: and thus he said as he went, O my son Abshalom, my son, my son Abshalom! who would grant that I had died in thy stead, O Abshalom, my son, my son!
010	2SA	019	001	And it was told unto Joab, Behold, the king is weeping and he mourneth for Abshalom.
010	2SA	019	002	And the victory on that day was turned into mourning unto all the people; for the people heard it said on that day, that the king was grieved for his son.
010	2SA	019	003	And the people repaired by stealth on that day when coming into the city, as usually steal away the people who are ashamed when they flee in battle.
010	2SA	019	004	But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Abshalom, O Abshalom, my son, my son!
010	2SA	019	005	And Joab came to the king, into the house, and said, Thou hast covered with shame this day the faces of all thy servants, who have saved thy life this day, and the life of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the life of thy wives, and the life of thy concubines;
010	2SA	019	006	Since thou lovest thy enemies, and hatest thy friends: for thou hast declared this day, that thou hast neither princes nor servants; for I perceive this day, that if Abshalom were but alive, and we all were dead this day, that then it would have been just right in thy eyes.
010	2SA	019	007	And now arise, go forth, and speak to the heart of thy servants; for by the Lord have I sworn, that if thou go not forth, there shall not remain one man with thee this night: and this would be worse unto thee than all the evil that hath befallen thee from thy youth until now.
010	2SA	019	008	Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told it unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king is sitting in the gate. And all the people came before the king; but Israel fled, every man to his tents.
010	2SA	019	009	And all the people were contending throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king hath saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he it was that hath delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land from before Abshalom.
010	2SA	019	010	And Abshalom, whom we had anointed over us, died in battle: and now why are ye silent about bringing the king back?
010	2SA	019	011	And king David sent to Zadok and to Ebyathar the priests, saying, Speak ye unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why will you be the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is already come to the king, to his house.
010	2SA	019	012	My brothers are ye, my bone and my flesh are ye: wherefore then will you be the last to bring back the king?
010	2SA	019	013	And to 'Amassa shall ye say, Art thou not my bone and my flesh? May God do so to me, and may he thus continue to do, if thou shalt not be captain of the army before me continually in the room of Joab.
010	2SA	019	014	And he turned the heart of all the men of Judah, as of one man: and these sent unto the king, Return thou, with all thy servants.
010	2SA	019	015	So the king returned, and came as far as the Jordan; and Judah came to Gilgal, to go forth to meet the king, to conduct the king over the Jordan.
010	2SA	019	016	Then hastened Shim'i the son of Gera, the Benjamite, who was of Bachurim, and went down with the men of Judah to meet king David.
010	2SA	019	017	And there were with him a thousand men of Benjamin, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they set hastily over the Jordan before the king.
010	2SA	019	018	And there went over the ferry-boat to carry over the king's household, and to do what was good in his eyes. And Shim'i the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was passing over the Jordan;
010	2SA	019	019	And he said unto the king, Let not my Lord impute it unto me as iniquity, neither do thou remember that in which thy servant acted perversely on the day that my Lord the king went forth out of Jerusalem, so that the king should lay it to his heart.
010	2SA	019	020	For thy servant doth know that I have indeed sinned; and, behold, I am come this day the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my Lord the king.
010	2SA	019	021	But Abishai the son of Zeruyah spoke out and said, Shall Shim'i for this not be put to death, because he cursed the Lord's anointed?
010	2SA	019	022	And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruyah, that ye should become a hindrance this day unto me? shall this day any man be put to death in Israel? for do I not know that this day I am king over Israel?
010	2SA	019	023	And the king said unto Shim'i, Thou shalt not die. And the king swore unto him.
010	2SA	019	024	And Mephibosheth the [grand] son of Saul came down to meet the king, and he had not dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day that the king departed until the day that he came home in peace.
010	2SA	019	025	And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore didst thou not go with me, Mephibosheth?
010	2SA	019	026	And he answered, My Lord, O king, my servant deceived me; for thy servant said, I will saddle for me the ass, that I may ride thereon, and go with the king; because thy servant is lame.
010	2SA	019	027	And he slandered thy servant unto my Lord the king; but my Lord the king is like an angel of God: do then what is good in thy eyes.
010	2SA	019	028	For all of my father's house were nothing but men deserving death with my Lord the king: and yet didst thou set thy servant among those that eat at thy own table. What other merit therefore have I, and what to complain of yet farther unto the king?
010	2SA	019	029	And the king said unto him, For what purpose speakest thou yet thy words? I have said, Thou and Ziba shall divide the field.
010	2SA	019	030	And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take the whole, since that my Lord the king is come [back] in peace unto his own house.
010	2SA	019	031	And Barzillai the Gil'adite came down from Rogelim; and he passed over the Jordan with the king, to accompany him over the Jordan.
010	2SA	019	032	Now Barzillai was very aged, eighty years old: and he had sustained the king while he lay at Machanayim; for he was a very great man.
010	2SA	019	033	And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will sustain thee near me in Jerusalem.
010	2SA	019	034	But Barzillai said unto the king, How many yet are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?
010	2SA	019	035	I am eighty years old this day: can I discern between good and evil? or can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? or can I listen yet to the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant become yet a burden unto my Lord the king?
010	2SA	019	036	Thy servant will pass a little way over the Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense me with this reward?
010	2SA	019	037	Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in my own city, by the sepulchre of my father and of my mother. But, behold, thy servant Kimham will pass over with my Lord the king; and do to him what is good in thy eyes.
010	2SA	019	038	And the king said, Kimham shall pass over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good in thy eyes: and whatsoever thou wilt desire of me, will I do for thee.
010	2SA	019	039	And all the people passed over the Jordan, after the king had passed over; and the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place.
010	2SA	019	040	Then did the king pass on to Gilgal, and Kimham passed on with him: and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel.
010	2SA	019	041	And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and have conducted the king and his household over the Jordan, and all David's men with him?
010	2SA	019	042	And all the men of Judah replied to the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then are ye so angry for this matter? have we eaten the least from the king? or hath he given us any gift?
010	2SA	019	043	And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, Ten parts have we in the king, and also in David have we more right than ye: why then did ye esteem us lightly? and was not our word the very first to bring back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.
010	2SA	020	001	And there happened to be a worthless man, whose name was Sheba', the son of Bichri, a Benjamite; and he blew the cornet, and said, We have no part in David, nor have we any inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel!
010	2SA	020	002	So every man of Israel went off from David, following Sheba' the son of Bichri; but the men of Judah adhered unto their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem.
010	2SA	020	003	And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women, the concubines, whom he had left to guard the house, and put them in a guard-house, and provided for them, but went not in unto them. So they were confined until the day of their death, living in widowhood.
010	2SA	020	004	Then said the king to 'Amassa, Call together for me the men of Judah within three days, and thou present thyself here [then].
010	2SA	020	005	So 'Amassa went to call Judah together; but he remained out longer than the set time which he had appointed him.
010	2SA	020	006	And David said to Abishai, Now will Sheba' the son of Bichri do us more harm than [did] Abshalom: take thou the servants of thy Lord, and pursue after him, lest he succeed in reaching fortified cities, and withdraw himself from our eyes.
010	2SA	020	007	And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Kerethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went forth out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba' the son of Bichri.
010	2SA	020	008	They were close by the great stone which is at Gib'on, as 'Amassa came before them. And Joab was girded with his coat, his [usual] garment, and upon it the girdle of the sword which was fastened upon his loins in its sheath; and as he went forth it fell out.
010	2SA	020	009	And Joab said to 'Amassa, Art thou in health, my brother? And Joab's right hand took hold of 'Amassa's beard to kiss him.
010	2SA	020	010	And 'Amassa did not guard himself against the sword that was in Joab's hand: so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. But Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba' the son of Bichri.
010	2SA	020	011	And one man of Joab's people remained standing by him, and said, He that favoreth Joab, and he that is for David, follow Joab.
010	2SA	020	012	And 'Amassa was wallowing in his blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he put 'Amassa aside out of the highway into the field, and threw a garment over him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.
010	2SA	020	013	When he was removed out of the highway, every man passed on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba' the son of Bichri.
010	2SA	020	014	And this one passed through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, which is of Beth-ma'achah, and all the Berim: and they assembled themselves together, and went also after him.
010	2SA	020	015	And they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-ma'achah, and they cast up a trench against the city, and it stood enclosed by the troops: and all the people that were with Joab were battering to throw down the wall.
010	2SA	020	016	Then called a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear: say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near as far as hither, that I may speak with thee.
010	2SA	020	017	And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou Joab? And he said, I am. Then said she unto him, Hear the words of thy hand-maid. And he said, I do hear.
010	2SA	020	018	Then said she, thus, They ought surely first to have spoken, saying, “Let them ask at least in Abel:” and so would they have come to an end.
010	2SA	020	019	I am one of the peaceful and faithful [cities] in Israel; thou seekest to overthrow a city and a metropolis in Israel: why wilt thou destroy the inheritance of the Lord?
010	2SA	020	020	And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should destroy or ruin.
010	2SA	020	021	The matter is not so; but a man from the mountains of Ephraim, Sheba' the son of Bichri is his name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, against David: give him up alone, and I will withdraw from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be cast down to thee over the wall.
010	2SA	020	022	And the woman came unto all the people with her wisdom; and they cut off the head of Sheba' the son of Bichri, and cast it down to Joab: and he blew the cornet, and they scattered themselves from the city, every man to his tents. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king.
010	2SA	020	023	Now Joab was over all the army of Israel; and Benayah the son of Yehoyada' was over the Kerethites and over the Pelethites;
010	2SA	020	024	And Adoram was over the tribute; and Jehoshaphat the son of Achilud was recorder;
010	2SA	020	025	And Sheva was scribe; and Zadok and Ebyathar were priests;
010	2SA	020	026	And 'Ira also the Yairite was an officer of state unto David.
010	2SA	021	001	And there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David besought the presence of the Lord. And the Lord said, On account of Saul, and on account of the house of blood, is this; because he hath slain the Gib'onites.
010	2SA	021	002	And the king called for the Gib'onites, and said unto them: [now the Gib'onites are not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Emorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them; but Saul had sought to slay them in his zeal for the children of Israel in Judah:]
010	2SA	021	003	Wherefore David said unto the Gib'onites, What shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of the Lord?
010	2SA	021	004	And the Gib'onites said unto him, We have no concern of silver or gold with Saul and with his house: nor do we wish to kill any man in Israel. And he said, What ye say, will I do for you.
010	2SA	021	005	And they said to the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us that we should be destroyed, so that we should have no footing in all the boundaries of Israel.
010	2SA	021	006	Let there be delivered unto us seven men of his sons, and we will hang them up unto the Lord in Gib'ah of Saul, the chosen of the Lord. And the king said, I will give them.
010	2SA	021	007	But the king had pity on Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the Lord's oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.
010	2SA	021	008	And the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Ayah, whom she had born unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she had brought up for 'Adriel the son of Barzillai the Mecholathite:
010	2SA	021	009	And he delivered them into the hand of the Gib'onites, and they hanged them on the mount before the Lord; and they fell, these seven, together; and they were put to death in the first days of harvest, in the beginning of the barley-harvest.
010	2SA	021	010	And Rizpah the daughter of Ayah took sackcloth, and spread out it for herself upon the rock, from the beginning of the harvest until water dropped down upon them out of heaven, and she suffered neither the birds of heaven to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.
010	2SA	021	011	And it was told to David what Rizpah the daughter of Ayah, the concubine of Saul, had done.
010	2SA	021	012	And David then went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Yabeshgil'ad, who had stolen them from the market-place of Bethshan, where the Philistines had hanged them up, at the time the Philistines had smitten Saul at Gilboa':
010	2SA	021	013	And he brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered up the bones of those that had been hanged.
010	2SA	021	014	And they buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin at Zela', in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king had commanded. And after that God was entreated for the land.
010	2SA	021	015	And the Philistines had again a war with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines: and David became fatigued.
010	2SA	021	016	And Yishbi at Nob, who was of the children of the Raphah, the weight of whose spear was three hundred shekels of copper, he being girded with a new armor, thought to slay David.
010	2SA	021	017	But Abishai the son of Zeruyah succored him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Then swore the men of David unto him, saying, Thou shalt go out no more with us to battle, that thou mayest not quench the lamp of Israel.
010	2SA	021	018	And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle at Gob, with the Philistines: then smote Sibbechai the Chushathite Saph, who was of the children of the Raphah.
010	2SA	021	019	And there was again a battle at Gob with the Philistines, when Elchanan the son of Ya'are-oregim, the Bethlechemite, slew Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.
010	2SA	021	020	And there was again a battle in Gath, where was a man of [great] stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, [in all] four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the Raphah.
010	2SA	021	021	And he defied Israel; but Jonathan the son of Shim'ah, the brother of David, slew him.
010	2SA	021	022	These four were born to the Raphah in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
010	2SA	022	001	And David spoke unto the Lord the words of this song, and on the day that the Lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul.
010	2SA	022	002	And he said, Lord, my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer;
010	2SA	022	003	God, my rock, in whom I trust; my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour! from violence dost thou save me!
010	2SA	022	004	Praised, I cried, be the Lord, and from my enemies was I saved.
010	2SA	022	005	For the waves of death encompassed me, the floods of destruction made me afraid;
010	2SA	022	006	The bonds of hell encircled me, the snares of death seized on me:
010	2SA	022	007	[When] in my distress I called upon the Lord, and to my God I cried; and he heard from his temple my voice, and my complaint [entered] into his ears.
010	2SA	022	008	Then shook and trembled the earth; the foundations of the heavens were moved; and they shook, because he was wroth.
010	2SA	022	009	Smoke went up in his anger, and consuming fire out of his mouth, coals flamed forth from him.
010	2SA	022	010	And he bent the heavens, and came down, and thick darkness was under his feet.
010	2SA	022	011	And he rode upon a cherub, and flew along, and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.
010	2SA	022	012	And he made darkness round about him into pavilions, heavy masses of waters, thick clouds of the skies.
010	2SA	022	013	From the brightness before him flamed forth coals of fire.
010	2SA	022	014	The Lord thundered from heaven, and the Most High uttered forth his voice.
010	2SA	022	015	And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.
010	2SA	022	016	And then were seen the channels of the sea, there were laid open the foundations of the world; at the rebuke of the Lord, through the blast of the breath of his nostrils.
010	2SA	022	017	He stretched out from above [his hand], he took me; he drew me out from the mighty waters.
010	2SA	022	018	He delivered me from my enemy, the strong, from those that hated me, when they were too mighty for me.
010	2SA	022	019	They overcame me on the day of my calamity; but the Lord became my stay;
010	2SA	022	020	And he brought me forth into a large space: he delivered me, because he had delight in me.
010	2SA	022	021	The Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the purity of my hands did he recompense me.
010	2SA	022	022	For I had kept the ways of the Lord, and had not wickedly departed from my God.
010	2SA	022	023	For all his ordinances were before me, and from none of his statutes did I depart.
010	2SA	022	024	I was also upright toward him, and I guarded myself against my iniquity.
010	2SA	022	025	Therefore did the Lord recompense me according to my righteousness, according to my purity before his eyes.
010	2SA	022	026	With the kind thou wilt show thyself kind; with the upright mighty man thou wilt show thyself upright.
010	2SA	022	027	With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; and with the perverse thou wilt wage a contest.
010	2SA	022	028	And the afflicted people thou wilt save; but thy eyes are upon the haughty, [that] thou mayest bring [them] down.
010	2SA	022	029	For thou art my lamp, O Lord! and the Lord will enlighten my darkness.
010	2SA	022	030	For [aided] by thee I run through a troop: [helped] by my God I leap over a wall.
010	2SA	022	031	As for God—his way is perfect; the word of the Lord is tried; he is a shield to all that trust in him.
010	2SA	022	032	For who is God, save the Lord? and who is a rock, save our God?
010	2SA	022	033	God is my strength and power; and he rendereth free from obstruction my way.
010	2SA	022	034	He maketh my feet like those of the hinds, and upon my high places he causeth me to stand.
010	2SA	022	035	He teaches my hands for the war, so that a brazen bow is bent by my arms.
010	2SA	022	036	And thou gavest me the shield of thy salvation; and thy assistance hath made me great.
010	2SA	022	037	Thou enlargest my steps under me, so that my joints do not slip.
010	2SA	022	038	I pursue my enemies and destroy them; and I return not again until I have made an end of them.
010	2SA	022	039	And I make an end of them, and I crush them, that they cannot rise; and they fall under my feet.
010	2SA	022	040	For thou hast girded me with strength for the war; thou subduest my opponents under me.
010	2SA	022	041	And my enemies thou causest to turn their back to me; those that hate me, —that I may destroy them.
010	2SA	022	042	They look about, but there is none to help; unto the Lord—but he answereth them not.
010	2SA	022	043	And I beat them small as the dust of the earth; as the mire of the street, I stamp them, I tread them down.
010	2SA	022	044	Thou hast also delivered me from the contests of my people: thou preservest me to be the head of nations, a people which I know not shall serve me.
010	2SA	022	045	The children of the stranger shall utter flattery unto me; as soon as their ear heareth they shall be obedient unto me.
010	2SA	022	046	The children of the stranger shall fade away, and come forth tottering out of their close places.
010	2SA	022	047	The Lord liveth, and blessed be my Rock; and exalted be the God, the Rock of my salvation;
010	2SA	022	048	The God, that granteth me vengeance, and bringeth down nations under me;
010	2SA	022	049	And that bringeth me forth from my enemies: also above my opponents thou liftest me up, from the man of violence thou deliverest me.
010	2SA	022	050	Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the nations, and unto thy name will I sing praises;
010	2SA	022	051	[To] the tower of salvation of his king, and who showeth kindness to his anointed, to David and to his seed forever.
010	2SA	023	001	And these are the last words of David. Thus saith David the son of Jesse, and thus saith the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet singer of Israel:
010	2SA	023	002	The Spirit of the Lord spoke through me, and his word was upon my tongue.
010	2SA	023	003	[Thus] said the God of Israel, concerning me spoke the Rock of Israel, That [I should be] ruler over men, be righteous, ruling in the fear of God;
010	2SA	023	004	And as in the light of morning the sun riseth, in a morning without clouds, with more than the brightness [reflected] by rain on the herbs that spring from the earth.
010	2SA	023	005	Truly is not so my house with God? since he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, firm in all, and sure? yea, will he not cause to grow all my salvation, and all my desire?
010	2SA	023	006	But the godless are all of them as waving thorns, which cannot be taken in the hand;
010	2SA	023	007	But the man that will touch them must protect his hand with iron and the staff of a spear: and they will be utterly burnt with fire in the dwelling.
010	2SA	023	008	These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Yosheb-bashebeth, the Thachkemonite, the chief among the captains, —the same as 'Adino the 'Eznite, —because of eight hundred slain at one time.
010	2SA	023	009	And after him was El'azar the son of Dodo, the son of Achochi, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel had withdrawn themselves;
010	2SA	023	010	He then arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand did cleave unto the sword: and the Lord wrought a great victory on that day; and the people returned after him only to strip [the slain].
010	2SA	023	011	And after him was Shammah the son of Age the Hararite. The Philistines were gathered together into a troop, and there was a piece of ground full of lentiles; and the people had fled from the Philistines;
010	2SA	023	012	But he placed himself in the midst of the ground, and delivered it, and smote the Philistines: and the Lord wrought a great victory.
010	2SA	023	013	And these three, the chiefs of the thirty, went down, and came to David at harvest-time unto the cave of 'Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
010	2SA	023	014	And David was then in the strong-hold, and an outpost of the Philistines was then in Beth-lechem.
010	2SA	023	015	And David longed, and said, Oh that one would bring me water to drink out of the well at Beth-lechem, which is by the gate!
010	2SA	023	016	And the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines; and drew water out of the well of Beth-lechem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David; but he would not drink thereof, and poured it out unto the Lord.
010	2SA	023	017	And he said, Far be it from me, O Lord, that I should do this: [is not this] the blood of the men that went at the risk of their life? and thus he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men.
010	2SA	023	018	And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruyah, was the chief of these three; and he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain, and had a name among the three.
010	2SA	023	019	Although he was the most honored of the three, wherefore he became their captain: he nevertheless attained not unto the three [in prowess].
010	2SA	023	020	And Benayahu the son of Yehoyada', the son of a valiant man, great in many acts of Kabzeel; he it was that smote the two lion-like heroes of Moab; he also went down and slew a lion in the midst of a pit on a day when it snowed;
010	2SA	023	021	And he slew an Egyptian, a man of good appearance; and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and he snatched the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.
010	2SA	023	022	These things did Benayahu the son of Yehoyada', and he had a name among the three mighty men.
010	2SA	023	023	He was more honored than the thirty; but he attained not to these three. And David appointed him in his private council.
010	2SA	023	024	'Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elchanan the son of Dodo of Beth-lechem,
010	2SA	023	025	Shammah the Charodite, Elika the Charodite,
010	2SA	023	026	Chelez the Paltite, 'Ira the son of 'Ikkesh the Teko'ite,
010	2SA	023	027	Abi'ezer the 'Anethothite, Mebunnai the Chushathite,
010	2SA	023	028	Zalmon the Achochite, Maharai the Netophathite,
010	2SA	023	029	Cheleb the son of Ba'anah, the Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai of Gib'ah of the children of Benjamin,
010	2SA	023	030	Benayahu the Pir'athonite, Hiddai of Nachale-Ga'ash,
010	2SA	023	031	Abi-'albon the 'Arbathite, 'Azmaveth the Barchumite,
010	2SA	023	032	Elyachba the Sha'albonite, Bne-yashen, Jonathan,
010	2SA	023	033	Shammah the Hararite, Achiam the son of Sharar the Ararite,
010	2SA	023	034	Eliphelet the son of Achasbai, the son of the Ma'achathite, Eli'am the son of Achithophel the Gilonite,
010	2SA	023	035	Chezrai, the Carmelite, Pa'arai the Arbite,
010	2SA	023	036	Yigal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,
010	2SA	023	037	Zelek the 'Ammonite, Nacharai the Beerothite, the armor-bearer of Joab the son of Zeruyah,
010	2SA	023	038	'Ira the Yithrite, Gareb the Yithrite,
010	2SA	023	039	Uriyah the Hittite: in all thirty and seven.
010	2SA	024	001	And again was the anger of the Lord kindled against Israel, and he incited David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.
010	2SA	024	002	And the king said to Joab the captain of the army, who was with him, Traverse, I pray thee, all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba', and number ye the people, that I may know the number of the people.
010	2SA	024	003	Then said Joab unto the king, Now may the Lord thy God add unto the people, how many soever they be, a hundred-fold more, and may the eyes of my Lord the king see it; but why doth my Lord the king find delight in this thing?
010	2SA	024	004	Nevertheless the king's word remained firm against Joab, and against the captains of the army: and Joab and the captains of the army went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.
010	2SA	024	005	And they passed over the Jordan, and encamped in 'Aro'er, on the right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the valley of Gad, and toward Ya'zer:
010	2SA	024	006	Then they came to Gil'ad, and to the land of Tachtimchodshi; and they came to Dan-ya'an, and about to Zidon;
010	2SA	024	007	And they came to the strong-hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites; and they went out to the south of Judah, up to Beer-sheba'.
010	2SA	024	008	And so they traversed all the land, and they came at the end of nine months and twenty days to Jerusalem.
010	2SA	024	009	And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.
010	2SA	024	010	And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said unto the Lord, I have sinned greatly in what I have done; and now, I beseech thee, O Lord, cause the iniquity of thy servant to pass away; for I have acted very foolishly.
010	2SA	024	011	And when David was arisen in the morning, The word of the Lord came unto Gad the prophet, David's seer, saying,
010	2SA	024	012	Go and speak unto David, Thus hath said the Lord, Three things do I offer thee: choose for thyself one of them, and I will do it unto thee.
010	2SA	024	013	So Gad came to David, and told it unto him; and he said unto him, Shall there come unto thee seven years of famine in thy land? or three months, that thou flee before thy enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be for three days a pestilence in thy land? now consider and see what word I shall bring back to him that hath sent me.
010	2SA	024	014	And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall then into the hand of the Lord, —for his mercies are great; but let me not fall into the hand of man.
010	2SA	024	015	And the Lord sent a pestilence in Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beer-sheba' seventy thousand men.
010	2SA	024	016	And when the angel stretched out his hand over Jerusalem to destroy it, the Lord bethought himself of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed among the people, It is enough: now stay thy hand. And the angel of the Lord was by the threshingfloor of Aravnah the Jebusite.
010	2SA	024	017	And David spoke unto the Lord when he saw the angel that smote among the people, and said, Lo, I have indeed sinned, and I have truly done wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? let thy hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's house.
010	2SA	024	018	And Gad came to David on that day, and said unto him, Go up, erect an altar unto the Lord on the threshing-floor of Aravnah the Jebusite.
010	2SA	024	019	And David went up, according to the word of Gad, as the Lord had commanded.
010	2SA	024	020	And Aravnah looked up, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Aravnah went out, and bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.
010	2SA	024	021	And Aravnah said, Wherefore is my Lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy from thee the threshingfloor, to build an altar unto the Lord, that the plague may be stayed from the people.
010	2SA	024	022	And Aravnah said unto David, Let my Lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good in his eyes: behold, the oxen are here for burnt-offerings, and the threshing rollers and the harness of the oxen for wood.
010	2SA	024	023	All these things did Aravnah, [for] the king, give unto the king. And Aravnah said unto the king, May the Lord thy God receive thee favorably.
010	2SA	024	024	And the king said unto Aravnah, No; but I will surely buy it from thee at the value; for I will not offer burnt-offerings unto the Lord my God without paying therefor. So David bought the threshing-floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
010	2SA	024	025	And David built there an altar unto the Lord, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings: and the Lord was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.

011	1KI	001	001	Now king David was old, stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he could not become warm.
011	1KI	001	002	Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let them seek out for my lord the king a young virgin, and let her stand before the king, and let her be an attendant on him; and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may become warm.
011	1KI	001	003	So they sought for a fair maiden throughout all the territory of Israel; and they found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king.
011	1KI	001	004	And the maiden was exceedingly fair; and she became an attendant on the king, and ministered to him; but the king knew her not.
011	1KI	001	005	And Adoniyah the son of Chaggith exalted himself, saying, I shall be king: and he procured himself a chariot and horsemen, and fifty men who ran before him.
011	1KI	001	006	And his father had never grieved him in all his life by saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also was of a very goodly form; and his mother had born him after Abshalom.
011	1KI	001	007	And he had conferences with Joab the son of Zeruyah, and with Ebyathar the priest: and they, following Adoniyah, helped him.
011	1KI	001	008	But Zadok the priest, and Benayahu the son of Yehoyada', and Nathan the prophet, and Shim'i, and Re'i, and the mighty men that belonged to David, were not with Adoniyah.
011	1KI	001	009	And Adoniyah slaughtered sheep and oxen and fatted cattle by the stone Zocheleth, which is by 'En-rogel; and he invited all his brothers the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants;
011	1KI	001	010	But Nathan the prophet, and Benayahu, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he invited not.
011	1KI	001	011	And Nathan spoke unto Bath-sheba' the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adoniyah the son of Chaggith is become king, and [that] David our lord knoweth it not?
011	1KI	001	012	And now come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thy own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.
011	1KI	001	013	Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thy hand-maid, saying, Assuredly, Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and only he shall sit upon my throne? why then is Adoniyah become king?
011	1KI	001	014	And, lo, while thou shalt be yet speaking there with the king, I myself will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.
011	1KI	001	015	And Bath-sheba' went in unto the king into the chamber, and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering unto the king.
011	1KI	001	016	And Bath-sheba' bowed, and prostrated herself unto the king: and the king said, What wouldst thou?
011	1KI	001	017	And she said unto him, My lord, thou thyself didst swear by the Lord thy God unto thy hand-maid, Assuredly, Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and only he shall sit upon my throne.
011	1KI	001	018	And now, behold, Adoniyah is become king; and now, my lord, O king, thou knowest it not:
011	1KI	001	019	And he hath slaughtered oxen and fatted cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath invited all the sons of the king, and Ebyathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the army; but Solomon thy servant hath he not invited.
011	1KI	001	020	And as for thee, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, to tell them, who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
011	1KI	001	021	Otherwise it would come to pass, when my lord the king sleepeth with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon may be counted offenders.
011	1KI	001	022	And, lo, while she was yet speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.
011	1KI	001	023	And they told the king, saying, Behold, here is Nathan the prophet: and when he was come in before the king, he prostrated himself before the king with his face to the ground.
011	1KI	001	024	And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou then said, Adoniyah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?
011	1KI	001	025	For he is gone down this day, and hath slaughtered oxen and fatted cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath invited all the king's sons, and the captains of the army, and Ebyathar the priest: and, behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and they say, Long live king Adoniyah.
011	1KI	001	026	But as for me, me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benayahu the son of Yehoyada', and thy servant Solomon, hath he not invited.
011	1KI	001	027	Can it be that this hath been done by order of my lord the king, and thou hast not informed thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?
011	1KI	001	028	Then answered king David, and said, Call me Bath-sheba'; and she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.
011	1KI	001	029	And the king swore and said, As the Lord liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress,
011	1KI	001	030	Even as I have sworn unto thee by the Lord the God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and only he shall sit upon my throne in my stead: even so will I certainly do this day.
011	1KI	001	031	Then did Bath-sheba' bow herself with her face to the earth, and prostrate herself unto the king; and she said, May my lord, the king David, live for ever!
011	1KI	001	032	And king David said, Call unto me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benayahu the son of Yehoyada'. And they came before the king.
011	1KI	001	033	And the king said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon my own mule, and conduct him down to Gichon:
011	1KI	001	034	And let Zadok the priest with Nathan the prophet anoint him there as king over Israel; and blow ye with the cornet, and say, Long live king Solomon.
011	1KI	001	035	Then shall ye go up after him, and he shall come and sit upon my throne; and he shall be king in my stead: and him have I ordained to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.
011	1KI	001	036	And Benayahu the son of Yehoyada' answered the king, and said, Amen: May thus say the Eternal the God of my lord the king.
011	1KI	001	037	As the Eternal hath been with my lord the king, even so may he be with Solomon, and may he make his throne greater than the throne of my lord the king David.
011	1KI	001	038	Thereupon Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benayahu the son of Yehoyada', and the Kerethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and conducted him to Gichon.
011	1KI	001	039	And Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew with the cornet; and all the people said, Long live king Solomon.
011	1KI	001	040	And all the people went up after him, and the people blew on flutes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth was rent at their noise.
011	1KI	001	041	And Adoniyah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had just finished eating: and when Joab heard the sound of the cornet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city in an uproar?
011	1KI	001	042	And while he was yet speaking, behold, Jonathan the son of Ebyathar the priest came in: and Adoniyah said [unto him], Come in; for thou art a worthy man, and must bring good tidings.
011	1KI	001	043	And Jonathan answered and said to Adoniyah, Alas, no; our lord king David hath made Solomon king;
011	1KI	001	044	And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benayahu the son of Yehoyada', and the Kerethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule;
011	1KI	001	045	And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him as king on the Gichon; and they are come up from there rejoicing, and the city hath been set in commotion. This is the noise that ye have heard.
011	1KI	001	046	And Solomon hath also sat on the kingly throne.
011	1KI	001	047	And also the king's servants are come to bless our lord king David, saying, May God make the name of Solomon more famous than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne: and the king hath bowed himself upon the bed.
011	1KI	001	048	And also thus hath the king said, Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel, who hath given [me] this day one who sitteth on my throne, while my eyes see it.
011	1KI	001	049	And all the guests that were with Adoniyah were terrified, and rose up, and went, every man, on his own way.
011	1KI	001	050	And Adoniyah was afraid because of Solomon; and he arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
011	1KI	001	051	And it was told unto Solomon, saying, Behold, Adoniyah feareth king Solomon; and, behold, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his servant with the sword.
011	1KI	001	052	And Solomon said, If he will become a worthy man, there shall not a hair of his fall to the earth; but if any wrong shall be found on him, then shall he die.
011	1KI	001	053	So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar; and he came and bowed himself to king Solomon; and Solomon said unto him, Go to thy house.
011	1KI	002	001	And when the days of David drew near that he should die, he charged Solomon his son, saying,
011	1KI	002	002	I am going the way of all the earth; but be thou strong, and become a man;
011	1KI	002	003	And keep the charge of the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, his commandments, and his ordinances, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses; in order that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself;
011	1KI	002	004	In order that the Lord may fulfill his word which he hath spoken concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall never fail thee, said he, a man on the throne of Israel.
011	1KI	002	005	And thou also knowest well what Joab the son of Zeruyah hath done to me, what he did to the two captains of the armies of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto 'Amassa the son of Yether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and on his shoes that were on his feet.
011	1KI	002	006	Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoary head go down in peace to the grave.
011	1KI	002	007	But unto the sons of Barzillai the Gil'adite show thou kindness, and let them be of those that eat at thy table; for so they came near to me when I fled from before Abshalom thy brother.
011	1KI	002	008	And, behold, thou hast with thee Shim'i the son of Gera, the Benjamite of Bachurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse on the day when I went to Machanayim; but who came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I swore to him by the Lord, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.
011	1KI	002	009	But now leave him not unpunished; for thou art a wise man; know then what thou oughtest to do unto him, and bring thou down his hoary head with blood to the grave.
011	1KI	002	010	And David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.
011	1KI	002	011	And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: in Hebron he reigned seven years, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years.
011	1KI	002	012	Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.
011	1KI	002	013	And Adoniyah the son of Chaggith came to Bath-sheba' the mother of Solomon: and she said, Is thy coming for peace? And he said, For peace.
011	1KI	002	014	He said moreover, I have a word for thee. And she said, Speak.
011	1KI	002	015	And he said, Thou well knowest that mine was the kingdom, and that on me all Israel had set their faces, that I should reign: nevertheless the kingdom was turned about, and became my brother's; for from the Lord was it [made] his.
011	1KI	002	016	And now there is one petition I am going to ask of thee, do not turn me away. And she said unto him, Speak.
011	1KI	002	017	And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, [for he will not turn thee away,] that he may give me Abishag the Shunammite for wife.
011	1KI	002	018	And Bath-sheba' said, Well: I will speak for thee unto the king.
011	1KI	002	019	Bath-sheba' thereupon went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adoniyah; and the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and then sat down on his throne, and placed a chair for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand.
011	1KI	002	020	Then said she, There is one small petition I am going to ask of thee; do not turn me away. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother; for I will not turn thee away.
011	1KI	002	021	And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adoniyah thy brother for wife.
011	1KI	002	022	And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adoniyah? rather ask for him the kingdom; for he is my elder brother; — even for him, and for Ebyathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruyah.
011	1KI	002	023	Then swore king Solomon by the Lord, saying, May God do so to me, and may he thus continue, if Adoniyah have not spoken this word against his own life.
011	1KI	002	024	And now, as the Lord liveth, who hath established me, and seated me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me a house, as he hath spoken, this very day shall Adoniyah be put to death.
011	1KI	002	025	And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benayahu the son of Yehoyada'; and he fell upon him so that he died.
011	1KI	002	026	And unto Ebyathar the priest said the king, Go to 'Anathoth, unto thy own fields; for thou art a man worthy of death; but on this day will I not put thee to death; because thou hast borne the ark of the Lord Eternal before David my father, and because thou was afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.
011	1KI	002	027	So Solomon banished Ebyathar that he should not be priest unto the Lord, to fulfill the word of the Lord, which he had spoken concerning the house of 'Eli in Shiloh.
011	1KI	002	028	And the report came to Joab; for Joab had turned after Adoniyah, though he had not turned after Abshalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the Lord, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
011	1KI	002	029	And it was told to king Solomon that Joab had fled unto the tabernacle of the Lord; and that, behold, he was close by the altar. Then sent Solomon Benayahu the son of Yehoyada,' saying, Go, fall upon him.
011	1KI	002	030	And Benayahu came to the tabernacle of the Lord, and said unto him, Thus hath said the king, Come forth. And he said, No; but here will I die. And Benayahu brought the king word again, saying, Thus hath Joab spoken, and thus hath he answered me.
011	1KI	002	031	Then said the king unto him, Do as he hath spoken, and fall upon him, and bury him; and remove [thus] the innocent blood, which Joab hath shed, from me, and from the house of my father.
011	1KI	002	032	And may the Lord bring back his blood-guiltiness upon his own head, because he fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, while my father David knew it not, Abner the son of Ner, the captain of the army of Israel, and 'Amassa the son of Yether, the captain of the army of Judah.
011	1KI	002	033	And their blood shall return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever; but unto David, and unto his seed, and unto his house, and unto his throne, may there be peace for ever from the Lord.
011	1KI	002	034	So Benayahu the son of Yehoyada' went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.
011	1KI	002	035	And the king appointed Benayahu the son of Yehoyada' in his place over the army; and Zadok the priest did the king appoint in the place of Ebyathar.
011	1KI	002	036	And the king sent and called for Shim'i, and said unto him, Build thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and thou shalt not go forth from there hither or thither.
011	1KI	002	037	And it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thy own head.
011	1KI	002	038	And Shim'i said unto the king, It is well: as my Lord the king hath spoken, so will thy servant do. And Shim'i dwelt in Jerusalem many days.
011	1KI	002	039	And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two servants of Shim'i ran away unto Achish the son of Ma'achah the king of Gath: and they told unto Shim'i, saying, Behold, thy servants are in Gath.
011	1KI	002	040	And Shim'i arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants; and Shim'i went, and brought his servants from Gath.
011	1KI	002	041	And it was told to Solomon that Shim'i had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and had returned.
011	1KI	002	042	And the king sent and called for Shim'i, and said unto him, Did I not make thee swear by the Lord, and warned thee, saying, On that day thou goest out, and walkest abroad hither or thither, know for certain that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, It is well, I have heard?
011	1KI	002	043	Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the Lord, and the commandment with which I charged thee?
011	1KI	002	044	The king said moreover to Shim'i, Thou well knowest all the wickedness of which thy heart is conscious, that thou hast done to David my father: and the Lord bringeth back thy wickedness upon thy own head;
011	1KI	002	045	But king Solomon will be blessed, and the throne of David will be established before the Lord for ever.
011	1KI	002	046	So the king commanded Benayahu the son of Yehoyada', who went out, and fell upon him, so that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.
011	1KI	003	001	And Solomon intermarried with Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and took the daughter of Pharaoh, and brought her into the city of David, until he had finished building his own house, and the house of the Lord, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.
011	1KI	003	002	But the people sacrificed still on the high-places; because there was no house built unto the name of the Lord, until those days.
011	1KI	003	003	And Solomon loved the Lord, walking in the statutes of David his father: only that he sacrificed and burnt incense on the high-places.
011	1KI	003	004	And the king went to Gib'on to sacrifice there; for that was the great high-place: one thousand burnt-offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.
011	1KI	003	005	In Gib'on the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream of the night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.
011	1KI	003	006	And Solomon said, Thou hast shown unto thy servant David my father great kindness, just as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, and thou hast given him a son who sitteth on his throne, as it is this day.
011	1KI	003	007	And now, O Lord my God, thou hast made thy servant king in the place of David my father: and I am but a young lad; I know not how to go out or come in.
011	1KI	003	008	And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot he numbered nor counted for multitude.
011	1KI	003	009	Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, to discern between good and bad; for who would [otherwise] be able to judge this thy great people?
011	1KI	003	010	And the speech was pleasing in the eyes of the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.
011	1KI	003	011	And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; and hast not asked for thyself riches, nor hast asked the life of thy enemies; but hast asked for thyself discernment to understand [how to give] judgment:
011	1KI	003	012	Behold, I have done according to thy word; lo, I have given thee a wise and a discerning heart; so that like unto thee there was none before thee, nor after thee shall any one arise like unto thee.
011	1KI	003	013	And also what thou hast not asked have I given thee, both riches and honor: so that like unto thee there shall not have been any one among the kings all thy days.
011	1KI	003	014	And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then will I lengthen thy days.
011	1KI	003	015	And Solomon awoke, and, behold, it was a dream; and he went to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and offered up burnt-offerings, and prepared peace-offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.
011	1KI	003	016	Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and placed themselves before him.
011	1KI	003	017	And the one woman said, Pardon, my Lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.
011	1KI	003	018	And it came to pass on the third day after I was delivered, that also this woman was delivered: and we were together, there was no stranger with us in the house, only we two were in the house.
011	1KI	003	019	And this woman's son died in the night; because she had overlaid him.
011	1KI	003	020	And she arose in the midst of the night, and took my son from beside me, while thy hand-maid slept, and laid him in her bosom, and her dead son she laid in my bosom.
011	1KI	003	021	And when I rose in the morning to give my son suck, behold, he was dead; but when I looked at him carefully in the morning, behold, it was not my son, whom I had born.
011	1KI	003	022	And the other woman said, It is not so; my son is the living one, and thy son is the dead; and this one said, It is not so; thy son is the dead, and my son is the living: thus they spoke before the king.
011	1KI	003	023	Then said the king, This one saith, This is my son that liveth, and thy son is dead: and the other saith, It is not so; thy son is the dead, and my son is the living.
011	1KI	003	024	And the king said, Fetch me a sword: and they brought the sword before the king.
011	1KI	003	025	And the king said, Hew the living child in two, and give the one half to one, and the other half to the other.
011	1KI	003	026	Then spoke the woman whose son was the living unto the king, for her love had become enkindled for her son, and she said, O pardon, my Lord, give her the living child, and only do not slay it; but the other said, Neither mine nor thine shall it be, hew it asunder.
011	1KI	003	027	The king then answered and said, Give her the living child, and do not slay it: she is its mother.
011	1KI	003	028	And when all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had given, they feared the king; for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to exercise justice.
011	1KI	004	001	Thus was king Solomon king over all Israel.
011	1KI	004	002	And these were the princes whom he had: 'Azaryahu the son of Zadok the priest;
011	1KI	004	003	Elichoreph and Achiyah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Achilud, the recorder;
011	1KI	004	004	And Benayahu the son of Yehoyada' over the army; and Zadok and Ebyathar priests;
011	1KI	004	005	And Azaryahu the son of Nathan was over the superintendents; and Zabud the son of Nathan was an officer of state and the king's friend;
011	1KI	004	006	And Achishar was over the household; and Adoniram the son of 'Abda was over the tribute.
011	1KI	004	007	And Solomon had twelve superintendents over all Israel, who provided for the king and his household: one month in the year had the particular one to procure provisions.
011	1KI	004	008	And these are their names: Ben-chur on the mountain of Ephraim;
011	1KI	004	009	Ben-deker, in Makaz, and in Sha'albim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-chanan;
011	1KI	004	010	Ben-chessed, in Arubboth; to him pertained Sochoh and all the land of Chepher;
011	1KI	004	011	Ben-abinadab, in all the district of Dor; he had Taphath the daughter of Solomon for wife;
011	1KI	004	012	Ba'ana the son of Achilud in Tha'anach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean, which is by Zarethanah beneath Yizre'el, from Beth-shean to Abel-mecholah, as far as beyond Yokme'am;
011	1KI	004	013	Ben-geber, in Ramoth-gil'ad; to him pertained the villages of Ya'ir the son of Menasseh, which are in Gil'ad; to him also pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, sixty great cities with walls and brazen bars;
011	1KI	004	014	Achinadab the son of 'Iddo in Machanayim;
011	1KI	004	015	Achima'az in Naphtali; he also took Bahsemath the daughter of Solomon for wife;
011	1KI	004	016	Ba'anah the son of Chushai in Asher and in Be'aloth;
011	1KI	004	017	Jehoshaphat the son of Paruach, in Issachar;
011	1KI	004	018	Shim'i the son of Ela, in Benjamin;
011	1KI	004	019	Geber the son of Uri in the country of Gil'ad, the country of Sichon the king of the Emorites, and of 'Og the king of Bashan; besides the one superintendent who was in the land.
011	1KI	004	020	Judah and Israel were numerous, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude; and they ate and drank, and made merry.
011	1KI	004	021	And Solomon was ruling over all the kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines, and as far as the boundary of Egypt, which brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.
011	1KI	004	022	And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty kors of fine flour, and sixty kors of meal,
011	1KI	004	023	Ten fatted oxen, and twenty pasture oxen, and a hundred sheep, besides harts, and roebucks, and fallow-deer, and fatted fowl.
011	1KI	004	024	For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river, from Thiphsach even to Gazzah, over all the kings on this side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him.
011	1KI	004	025	And Judah and Israel dwelt in safety, every man under his vine and under his fig-tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba', all the days of Solomon.
011	1KI	004	026	And Solomon had forty thousand stalls for the horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.
011	1KI	004	027	And those superintendents provided for king Solomon, and for all that came near unto king Solomon's table, every man in his month: they let nothing be wanting.
011	1KI	004	028	The barley also and the straw for the horses and the runners did they bring unto the place where he might be, every man according to his prescription.
011	1KI	004	029	And God gave unto Solomon wisdom and understanding exceedingly much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea-shore.
011	1KI	004	030	And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.
011	1KI	004	031	And he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrachite, and Heman, and Kalkol, and Darda', the sons of Machol: and his name was [spread] among all the nations round about.
011	1KI	004	032	And he spoke three thousand proverbs; and his songs were a thousand and five.
011	1KI	004	033	And he spoke concerning the trees, from the cedar-tree that is on the Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall; he spoke also concerning the beasts, and concerning the fowl, and concerning the creeping things, and concerning the fishes.
011	1KI	004	034	And men came from all the people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all the kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom.
011	1KI	005	001	And Hiram the king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father; for Hiram had all the time been a lover of David.
011	1KI	005	002	And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,
011	1KI	005	003	Thou well knowest of David my father, that he was not able to build a house unto the name of the Lord his God, on account of the war wherewith his enemies encompassed him, until the Lord had put them under the soles of his feet.
011	1KI	005	004	But now hath the Lord my God given me rest on every side, there is neither adversary nor evil hinderance.
011	1KI	005	005	And, behold, I purpose to build a house unto the name of the Lord my God, as the Lord hath spoken unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will place in thy room upon thy throne, he it is that shall build the house unto my name.
011	1KI	005	006	And now command thou that they hew me cedar-trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants; and the wages of thy servants will I give unto thee in accordance with all that thou wilt say; for thou well knowest that there is not among us a man that hath the skill to hew timber like unto the Zidonians.
011	1KI	005	007	And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly; and he said, Blessed be the Lord this day, who hath given unto David a wise son over this numerous people.
011	1KI	005	008	And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have heard what thou hast sent to me for: I will gladly execute all thy desire in respect of timber of cedar, and in respect of timber of fir.
011	1KI	005	009	My servants shall bring them down from the Lebanon unto the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place of which thou wilt send me word, and I will cause them to be taken apart there, and thou shalt take them away; and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving the food for my household.
011	1KI	005	010	So Hiram gave Solomon cedar-trees and fir-trees, all his desire.
011	1KI	005	011	And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand kors of wheat as provision for his household, and twenty kors of beaten oil: thus did Solomon give to Hiram year by year.
011	1KI	005	012	And the Lord gave wisdom unto Solomon, as he had spoken to him; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they made a covenant with each other.
011	1KI	005	013	And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.
011	1KI	005	014	And he sent them into the Lebanon, ten thousand in each month by turns; one month they used to be in the Lebanon, two months at home: and Adoniram was over the levy.
011	1KI	005	015	And there belonged to Solomon seventy thousand bearers of burdens, and eighty thousand stone-cutters in the mountains;
011	1KI	005	016	Besides the chiefs who were appointed by Solomon over the work, three thousand and three hundred, who ruled over the people that wrought on the work.
011	1KI	005	017	And when the king commanded, they quarried out great stones, heavy stones, to lay the foundation of the house, and hewn stones.
011	1KI	005	018	And the builders of Solomon, and the builders of Hiram, and the Giblites hewed them; and so they prepared the wood and the stones to build the house.
011	1KI	006	001	And it came to pass, in the four hundred and eightieth year after the going forth of the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year, in the month Ziv, which is the second month, of the reign of Solomon over Israel, that he built the house unto the Lord.
011	1KI	006	002	And the house which king Solomon built unto the Lord, was sixty cubits in length, and twenty in breadth, and thirty cubits in height.
011	1KI	006	003	And the porch before the temple of the house, was twenty cubits in length, in front of the breadth of the house; and ten cubits in breadth at the east side of the house.
011	1KI	006	004	And he made for the house windows wide without and narrow within.
011	1KI	006	005	And he built on the wall of the house a gallery round about, on the walls of the house round about, of the temple and of the most holy place: and he made side-chambers round about.
011	1KI	006	006	The nethermost gallery was five cubits in breadth, and the middle was six cubits in breadth, and the third was seven cubits in breadth; for projections had he made to the house round about on the outside, so as to fasten nothing in the walls of the house.
011	1KI	006	007	And the house, when it was in building, was built of entire stones as they had been prepared at the quarry: so that neither hammer, nor axe, nor any tool of iron was heard in the house, while it was in building.
011	1KI	006	008	The door for the middle [gallery] sidechamber was in the right side of the house: and with winding stairs they went up into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the third.
011	1KI	006	009	So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with hollow tiles, and with boards of cedar.
011	1KI	006	010	And he built the gallery against all the house, [each] five cubits in height; and it was fastened on to the house with timber of cedar.
011	1KI	006	011	And the word of the Lord came to Solomon, saying,
011	1KI	006	012	This house which thou art building—if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my ordinances, and keep all my commandments to walk in them: then will I perform my word with thee, which I have spoken unto David thy father.
011	1KI	006	013	And I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel, and I will not forsake my people Israel.
011	1KI	006	014	So did Solomon build the house, and finish it.
011	1KI	006	015	And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar; from the floor of the house to where the walls touched the ceiling did he overlay it on the inside with wood; and he overlaid the floor of the house with boards of fir.
011	1KI	006	016	And he built the twenty cubits on the lower side of the house with boards of cedar, from the floor to the battlements; and he built it within, for the debir, for the holy of holies.
011	1KI	006	017	And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long.
011	1KI	006	018	And the cedar on the house within was carved with colocynths and opening flowers; all was cedar, no stone was seen.
011	1KI	006	019	And the debir in the house within did he prepare, to set therein the ark of the covenant of the Lord.
011	1KI	006	020	And the interior of the debir was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits was its height: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and he overlaid the altar with cedar-wood.
011	1KI	006	021	And Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he barred by means of chains of gold the front of the debir; and he overlaid it with gold.
011	1KI	006	022	And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until all the house was finished: also the whole altar that was before the debir did he overlay with gold.
011	1KI	006	023	And within the debir he made two cherubims of oleaster-wood, each ten cubits high.
011	1KI	006	024	And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: [there were] ten cubits from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other.
011	1KI	006	025	And the other cherub was also ten cubits: both the cherubim were of one measure and one form.
011	1KI	006	026	The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so that of the other cherub.
011	1KI	006	027	And he set the cherubim within the innermost part of the house: and they spread forth the wings of the cherubim, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings toward the middle of the house touched one another.
011	1KI	006	028	And he overlaid the cherubim with gold.
011	1KI	006	029	And on all the wall of the house round about he carved figures of cherubim and palm-trees and opening flowers, in the debir and in the temple.
011	1KI	006	030	And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold for the debir and for the temple.
011	1KI	006	031	And for the entrance of the debir he made doors of oleaster-wood: the lintel with the side-posts forming five sides.
011	1KI	006	032	And also upon the two doors of oleaster-wood he carved figures of cherubim and palm-trees and opening flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread the gold, by beating, upon the cherubim, and upon the palm-trees.
011	1KI	006	033	So also made he for the entrance of the temple door-posts of oleaster-wood in shape of a square;
011	1KI	006	034	And two doors of fir-wood: the one door having two leaves which were folding, and the other door having two leaves which were folding.
011	1KI	006	035	And he carved thereon cherubim, and palm-trees and opening flowers: and he overlaid them with gold fitting upon the carved work.
011	1KI	006	036	And he built the inner court of three rows of hewn stone, and one row of cedar beams.
011	1KI	006	037	In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the Lord laid, in the month Ziv;
011	1KI	006	038	And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all its parts, and according to all its requirements. So was he building it seven years.
011	1KI	007	001	But his own house was Solomon building thirteen years, and then he finished all his house.
011	1KI	007	002	He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon: a hundred cubits was its length, and fifty cubits was its breadth, and thirty cubits was its height, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.
011	1KI	007	003	And it was covered with cedar above over the beams, that lay on the forty-five pillars, fifteen in a row.
011	1KI	007	004	And there were window-spaces in three rows, and windows were opposite each other in three ranks.
011	1KI	007	005	And all the entrances and door-posts formed a square in shape: and windows were opposite windows in three ranks.
011	1KI	007	006	And he made a porch of pillars: fifty cubits was its length, and thirty cubits its breadth; and the porch was before them; and the other pillars with an entablature before them.
011	1KI	007	007	Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other.
011	1KI	007	008	And his house where he dwelt in another court within the porch, was of the like work: and Solomon made also a house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had taken for wife, like unto this porch.
011	1KI	007	009	All these were of heavy stones, hewn after a fixed measure, sawed with the saw inside and outside, even from the foundation unto the coping, and from the outside unto the great court.
011	1KI	007	010	And the foundation was of heavy stones, large stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.
011	1KI	007	011	And above were heavy stones, hewn after a fixed measure, and cedars.
011	1KI	007	012	And the great court round about was of three rows of hewn stones, and one row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the Lord, and for the porch of the house.
011	1KI	007	013	And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.
011	1KI	007	014	He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in copper: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and knowledge, to make every work in copper; and he came to king Solomon, and did all his work.
011	1KI	007	015	And he cast two pillars of copper, eighteen cubits was the height of the one pillar; and a line of twelve cubits did encompass the second pillar.
011	1KI	007	016	And he made two capitals, to set upon the tops of the pillars, of molten copper; five cubits was the height of the one capital, and five cubits was the height of the other capital;
011	1KI	007	017	And nets of checker-work, and wreaths of chain-work, for the capitals which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital.
011	1KI	007	018	And he made the pillars, so that two rows of pomegranates were round about upon the one net-work, to cover the capitals that were upon the top: and the same he made for the other capital.
011	1KI	007	019	And the capitals, that were upon the top of the pillars, furnished with lily-work, [as] those in the porch, were four cubits.
011	1KI	007	020	And the capitals upon the two pillars rose also above, close by the rounding which was on the side of the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred, in rows round about, upon either capital.
011	1KI	007	021	And he set up the pillars for the porch of the temple; and he set up the right pillar, and called its name Yachin; and he set up the left pillar, and called its name Boaz.
011	1KI	007	022	And upon the top of the pillars there was lily-work: and so was finished the work of the pillars.
011	1KI	007	023	And he made the molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other, rounded all about, and it was five cubits in height: and a line of thirty cubits did encompass it round about.
011	1KI	007	024	And colocynth-shaped knobs were under its brim round about encompassing it, ten in a cubit, encircling the sea round about: the colocynths were in two rows, and were cast [with it] when it was cast.
011	1KI	007	025	It was standing upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was resting above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.
011	1KI	007	026	And its thickness was a hand's breadth, and its brim was wrought like the brim of a cup, with lily-buds: it could contain two thousand baths.
011	1KI	007	027	And he made ten bases of copper: four cubits was the length of each one base, and four cubits its breadth, and three cubits its height.
011	1KI	007	028	And this was the workmanship of the bases: They had borders, and the borders were between the corner ledges;
011	1KI	007	029	And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim; and upon the corner ledges it was thus also above; and likewise beneath the lions and oxen were pendant wreaths of plated work.
011	1KI	007	030	And every base had four copper wheels, and axles of copper; and its four corners had undersetters; under the laver were the undersetters cast on; at the side of each were pendants.
011	1KI	007	031	And its mouth was within the capital and above a cubit in height; but the mouth of this was rounded after the work of the base, a cubit and a half cubit; and also upon its mouth were carvings; and their borders were square, not rounded.
011	1KI	007	032	And the four wheels were under the borders; and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base: and the height of each one wheel was a cubit and a half cubit.
011	1KI	007	033	And the workmanship of the wheels was like the workmanship of a chariot-wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes, were all cast.
011	1KI	007	034	And there were four undersetters to the four corners of each one base; the undersetters were of one piece with the base itself.
011	1KI	007	035	And on the top of the base was a rounded compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base were its side-ledges; and its borders were of one piece with itself.
011	1KI	007	036	And he engraved on the plates of its side-ledges and on its borders, cherubim, lions, and palm-trees: and in the open space of every one were pendant wreaths round about.
011	1KI	007	037	After this manner did he make the ten bases: one casting, one measure, one form, was there for all of them.
011	1KI	007	038	Then made he ten lavers of copper; forty baths could each one laver contain; every laver was four cubits: each one laver was upon each one base of the ten bases.
011	1KI	007	039	And he put the bases, five on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and the sea he set on the right side of the house eastward opposite the south.
011	1KI	007	040	And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basins; so Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made for king Solomon for the house of the Lord.
011	1KI	007	041	The two pillars, and the two bowl-shaped capitals that were on the top of the two pillars; and the two net-works, to cover the two bowl-shaped capitals which were upon the top of the pillars;
011	1KI	007	042	And the four hundred pomegranates for the two net-works, two rows of pomegranates for each one net-work, to cover the two bowl-shaped, capitals that were upon the front of the pillars;
011	1KI	007	043	And the ten bases, and the ten lavers upon the bases;
011	1KI	007	044	And the one sea, and the twelve oxen under the sea;
011	1KI	007	045	And the pots, and the shovels, and the basins; and all these vessels, which Hiram had made for king Solomon for the house of the Lord, were of polished copper.
011	1KI	007	046	In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay-ground between Succoth and Zarethan.
011	1KI	007	047	And Solomon set down all the vessels [unweighed], because they were exceedingly many: the weight of the copper was not inquired into.
011	1KI	007	048	And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the Lord: The altar of gold, and the table whereupon the show-bread was, of gold,
011	1KI	007	049	And the candlesticks, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the debir, of pure gold, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold,
011	1KI	007	050	And the bowls, and the knives, and the basins, and the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges, for the doors of the inner house, for the holy of holies, for the doors of the house, and for the temple, [were] of gold.
011	1KI	007	051	And so was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the Lord: and Solomon brought in the things sanctified by David his father, the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, [and] he placed [these] in the treasuries of the house of the Lord.
011	1KI	008	001	Then did Solomon assemble the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the divisions of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the city of David, which is Zion.
011	1KI	008	002	And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.
011	1KI	008	003	And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.
011	1KI	008	004	And they brought up the ark of the Lord, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle: even these did the priests and the Levites bring up.
011	1KI	008	005	And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.
011	1KI	008	006	And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord unto its place, into the debir of the house, into the most holy place, under the wings of the cherubim.
011	1KI	008	007	For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and its staves from above.
011	1KI	008	008	And they had made the staves so long, that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place in the front of the debir, but they were not seen without; and they have remained there until this day.
011	1KI	008	009	There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses had placed therein at Horeb, where the Lord made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.
011	1KI	008	010	And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the Lord:
011	1KI	008	011	And the priests were not able to stand to minister because of the cloud; for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord.
011	1KI	008	012	Then said Solomon, The Lord said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.
011	1KI	008	013	I have indeed built a dwelling-house for thee, a settled place for thy abode for ever.
011	1KI	008	014	And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel; and all the congregation of Israel was standing;
011	1KI	008	015	And he said, Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it, when he said,
011	1KI	008	016	Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I did not make choice of any city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house, that my name might be therein; but I made choice of David to be over my people Israel.
011	1KI	008	017	And it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the Lord, the God of Israel.
011	1KI	008	018	But the Lord said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in thy heart:
011	1KI	008	019	Nevertheless, thou shalt not thyself build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my name.
011	1KI	008	020	And the Lord hath fulfilled his word that he hath spoken: and I am risen up in the room of David my father, and I sit on the throne of Israel, as the Lord hath spoken, and I have built the house for the name of the Lord the God of Israel.
011	1KI	008	021	And I have assigned there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of the Lord, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt.
011	1KI	008	022	And Solomon now placed himself before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven;
011	1KI	008	023	And he said, O Lord, the God of Israel, there is no god like thee, in the heavens above, and on the earth beneath, thou who keepest the covenant and the kindness for thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart;
011	1KI	008	024	Who hast kept for thy servant David my father what thou hadst promised him; and thou spokest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thy hand, as it is this day.
011	1KI	008	025	And now, O Lord, the God of Israel, keep for thy servant David my father what thou hast spoken concerning him, saying, There shall never fail thee a man in my sight who sitteth on the throne of Israel; if thy children but take heed to their way to walk before me, as thou hast walked before me.
011	1KI	008	026	And now, O God of Israel, I pray thee, let thy word be verified, which thou hast spoken unto thy servant David my father.
011	1KI	008	027	For in truth will God then dwell on the earth? behold, the heavens and the heavens of heavens cannot contain thee: how much less then this house that I have built!
011	1KI	008	028	Yet wilt thou turn thy regard unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O Lord my God, to listen unto the entreaty and unto the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee today;
011	1KI	008	029	That thy eyes may be open toward this house night and day, toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there; that thou mayest listen unto the prayer which thy servant shall pray at this place.
011	1KI	008	030	And listen thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, which they will pray at this place: and oh, do thou hear in heaven thy dwelling-place; and hear, and forgive.
011	1KI	008	031	If any man trespass against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thy altar in this house:
011	1KI	008	032	Then do thou hear in heaven, and act, and judge thy servants, by condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and by justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.
011	1KI	008	033	When thy people Israel are struck down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and they return then to thee, and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication unto thee in this house:
011	1KI	008	034	Then do thou hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and cause them to return unto the land which thou hast given unto their fathers.
011	1KI	008	035	When the heavens be shut up, and there be no rain, because they have sinned against thee, and they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, because thou hast afflicted them:
011	1KI	008	036	Then do thou hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel; for thou wilt teach them the good way wherein they should walk; and give then rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.
011	1KI	008	037	If there be a famine in the land, if there be pestilence, blasting, mildew, or if there be locust, caterpillar, if their enemy besiege them in the land of their gates; at whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness;
011	1KI	008	038	What prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, of all thy people Israel, when they shall be conscious every man of the plague of his own heart, and he then spread forth his hands toward this house:
011	1KI	008	039	Then do thou hear in heaven the place of thy dwelling, and forgive, and act, and give to every man in accordance with all his ways, as thou mayest know his heart; for thou, thyself alone, knowest the heart of all the children of men;
011	1KI	008	040	In order that they may fear thee all the days that they live on the face of the land which thou hast given unto our fathers.
011	1KI	008	041	But also to the stranger, who is not of thy people Israel, but cometh out of a far-off country for the sake of thy name;
011	1KI	008	042	For they will hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of thy outstretched arm; when he will come and pray at this house:
011	1KI	008	043	Mayest thou listen in heaven the place of thy dwelling, and do according to all that the stranger will call on thee for; in order that all the nations of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as [do] thy people Israel; and that they may understand that this house, which I have built, is called by thy name.
011	1KI	008	044	If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, on the way on which thou mayest send them, and they do pray unto the Lord in the direction of the city which thou hast chosen, and of the house that I have built for thy name:
011	1KI	008	045	Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and procure them justice.
011	1KI	008	046	If they sin against thee, [for there is no man that may not sin,] and thou be angry with them, and give them up before the enemy, so that their captors carry them away captive unto the land of the enemy, [be it] far or near;
011	1KI	008	047	And if they then take it to their heart in the land whither they have been carried captive, and repent, and make supplication unto thee in the land of their captors, saying, We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, we have acted wickedly;
011	1KI	008	048	And they return unto thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies, who have led them away captive, and they pray unto thee in the direction of their land, which thou hast given unto their fathers, of the city which thou hast chosen, and of the house which I have built for thy name:
011	1KI	008	049	Then hear thou in heaven the place of thy dwelling their prayer and their supplication, and procure them justice;
011	1KI	008	050	And forgive thy people for what they have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions whereby they have transgressed against thee, and cause them to find mercy before their captors, that they may have mercy on them;
011	1KI	008	051	For they are thy people, and thy heritage, whom thou hast brought forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the iron furnace;
011	1KI	008	052	That thy eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to listen unto them in all for which they call unto thee;
011	1KI	008	053	For thou hast separated them unto thee as a heritage from all the people of the earth, as thou spokest by the hand of Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest forth our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord Eternal.
011	1KI	008	054	And it happened, that, when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the Lord, he arose from before the altar of the Lord from kneeling on his knees, with his hands spread out toward heaven.
011	1KI	008	055	And he stood up, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying,
011	1KI	008	056	Blessed be the Lord, who hath given rest unto his people Israel, in accordance with all that he hath spoken: [so that] there hath not failed one word of all his good promise, which he spoke by the hand of Moses his servant.
011	1KI	008	057	The Lord our God be with us, as he was with our fathers; oh may he not leave us, nor forsake us;
011	1KI	008	058	That he may incline our heart unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his ordinances, which he commanded our fathers.
011	1KI	008	059	And may these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the Lord, be nigh unto the Lord our God day and night, that he may maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel in their daily requirements;
011	1KI	008	060	In order that all the nations of the earth may know that the Lord is the [true] God, and none else.
011	1KI	008	061	Let your heart therefore be entire with the Lord our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.
011	1KI	008	062	And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifices before the Lord.
011	1KI	008	063	And Solomon offered [as] the sacrifice of peace-offering which he offered unto the Lord, two and twenty thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. And thus did the king and all the children of Israel dedicate the house of the Lord.
011	1KI	008	064	On the same day did the king hallow the interior of the court that was before the house of the Lord; for he prepared there the burnt-offerings, and the meat-offerings, and the fat of the peace-offerings; because the copper altar that was before the Lord was too small to contain the burnt-offerings, and the meat-offerings, and the fat of the peace-offerings.
011	1KI	008	065	And Solomon held at that time the feast, and all Israel with him, a great assembly, from the entrance of Chamath unto the river of Egypt, before the Lord our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.
011	1KI	008	066	On the eighth day he dismissed the people, and they blessed the king; and they went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart, because of all the good that the Lord had done for David his servant, and for Israel his people.
011	1KI	009	001	And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished building the house of the Lord, and the king's house, and all Solomon's desire which he was pleased to execute:
011	1KI	009	002	That the Lord appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared unto him at Gib'on.
011	1KI	009	003	And the Lord said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, that thou hast offered before me; I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and my eyes and my heart shall be there at all times.
011	1KI	009	004	And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in rectitude, to do in accordance with all that I have commanded thee, [and] wilt keep my statutes and my ordinances:
011	1KI	009	005	Then will I establish the throne of thy kingdom over Israel for ever; as I have spoken concerning David thy father, saying, There shall never fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.
011	1KI	009	006	But if ye will at all turn away, ye or your children, from following me, and will not keep my commandments [and] my statutes which I have set before you, and go and serve other gods, and bow down to them:
011	1KI	009	007	Then will I cut off Israel from the face of the land which I have given them; and the house, which I have hallowed unto my name, will I cast away from my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a by-word among all the nations;
011	1KI	009	008	And at this house, [which] should be so exalted, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and men will say, Why hath the Lord done thus unto this land, and unto this house?
011	1KI	009	009	And they shall say, For the cause that they forsook the Lord their God, who had brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and took hold of other gods, and bowed down to them, and served them: therefore hath the Lord brought upon them all this evil.
011	1KI	009	010	And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the Lord, and the king's house,
011	1KI	009	011	(Now Hiram the king of Tyre had supplied Solomon with cedar-trees and fir-trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that king Solomon then gave to Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.
011	1KI	009	012	And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; but they were not right in his eyes.
011	1KI	009	013	And he said, What kind of cities are these which thou hast given me, my brother? And he called them, The land of Cabul, until this day.
011	1KI	009	014	And Hiram sent to the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold.
011	1KI	009	015	And this is the manner of the levy which king Solomon raised, to build the house of the Lord, and his own house, and the Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Chazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.
011	1KI	009	016	(Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and captured Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it as a marriage-present unto his daughter, Solomon's wife.
011	1KI	009	017	And Solomon built Gezer, and lower Beth-choron,
011	1KI	009	018	And Ba'alath, and Thadmor in the wilderness, in the land,
011	1KI	009	019	And all the treasure-cities that Solomon had, and the cities for the chariots, and the cities for the horsemen, and the [other] desire of Solomon which he desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.)
011	1KI	009	020	All the people that were left of the Emorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the children of Israel,
011	1KI	009	021	Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel had not been able utterly to destroy, these did Solomon levy as tributary laborers until this day.
011	1KI	009	022	Yet of the children of Israel did Solomon make no one a bond-man; but they were the men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and the officers of his chariots, and of his horsemen.
011	1KI	009	023	These [also] were the chiefs of the superintendents that were over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, who ruled over the people that wrought on the work.
011	1KI	009	024	But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which he had built for her: then did he build the Millo.
011	1KI	009	025	And Solomon did offer three times in every year burnt-offerings and peace-offerings upon the altar which he had built unto the Lord, and he burnt incense upon the one that was before the Lord. So he finished the house.
011	1KI	009	026	And king Solomon made a ship in 'Ezyon-geber, which is near Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.
011	1KI	009	027	And Hiram sent in the ship his servants, seamen, that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.
011	1KI	009	028	And they came to Ophir, and fetched from there gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.
011	1KI	010	001	And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon in connection with the name of the Lord, she came to prove him with riddles.
011	1KI	010	002	And she came to Jerusalem with an exceedingly great train, with camels bearing spices, and gold in great abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she spoke with him of all that was on her heart.
011	1KI	010	003	And Solomon solved [for] her all her questions: nothing remained hidden from the king, which he did not tell her.
011	1KI	010	004	And when the queen of Sheba saw all Solomon's wisdom, and the house that he had built,
011	1KI	010	005	And the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cup-bearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the Lord: there was no more spirit in her.
011	1KI	010	006	And she said to the king, The truth only was the word that I heard in my own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.
011	1KI	010	007	And I believed not in the words, until I came, and my eyes saw [all]: and, behold, the half hath not been told me; thou excellest in wisdom and prosperity the report which I have heard.
011	1KI	010	008	Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, who stand before thee continually, who hear thy wisdom.
011	1KI	010	009	Blessed be the Lord thy God, who hath had delight in thee, to place thee on the throne of Israel; because the Lord loveth Israel for ever, therefore hath he made thee king, to do justice and righteousness.
011	1KI	010	010	And she gave to the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices a very great store, and precious stones: there came no more spices in such abundance as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.
011	1KI	010	011	And also the ship of Hiram, that fetched gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir in great abundance sandal-wood and precious stones.
011	1KI	010	012	And the king made of the sandal-wood a railing for the house of the Lord, and for the king's house, and harps and psalteries for the singers: there came no such sandal-wood, nor was it seen [again] until this day.
011	1KI	010	013	And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her pleasure, whatsoever she asked, beside what Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned about and went to her own country, she and her servants.
011	1KI	010	014	Now the weight of the gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty and six talents of gold,
011	1KI	010	015	Beside [what he had] of the traveling tradesmen, and of the traffic of the merchants, and of the kings of confederate nations, and of the governors of the country.
011	1KI	010	016	And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of gold he used for each one target.
011	1KI	010	017	And [he made] three hundred shields of beaten gold; three manehs of gold he used for each one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
011	1KI	010	018	The king also made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold.
011	1KI	010	019	The throne had six steps, and there was a round top on the throne behind; and there were arms on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the arms.
011	1KI	010	020	And twelve lions stood there upon the six steps on both sides: there was not the like made in any other kingdom.
011	1KI	010	021	And all king Solomon's drinking-vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver; it was not valued in the days of Solomon at the least.
011	1KI	010	022	For the king had a Tharshish-ship at sea with the ship of Hiram: once in three years the Tharshish-ship used to come home, laden with gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
011	1KI	010	023	And king Solomon became greater than all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom.
011	1KI	010	024	And [men of] all the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.
011	1KI	010	025	And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armor, and spices, horses, and mules: and so year by year.
011	1KI	010	026	And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he quartered in the cities for chariots, and near the king at Jerusalem.
011	1KI	010	027	And the king rendered the silver in Jerusalem like stones, and the cedars he rendered like the sycamore-trees that are in the lowlands, for abundance.
011	1KI	010	028	And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt; and a company of the king's merchants bought a quantity at a price.
011	1KI	010	029	And a chariot-team came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.
011	1KI	011	001	But king Solomon loved many strange women, beside the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, 'Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites.
011	1KI	011	002	From the nations concerning which the Lord had said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in among them, nor shall they come in among you; surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: unto these Solomon did cleave to love them.
011	1KI	011	003	And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.
011	1KI	011	004	And it came to pass, at the time that Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods; and his heart was not undivided with the Lord his God, like the heart of David his father.
011	1KI	011	005	And Solomon went after 'Ashtoreth the divinity of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the 'Ammonites.
011	1KI	011	006	And Solomon did what is evil in the eyes of the Lord, and went not fully after the Lord, like David his father.
011	1KI	011	007	Then did Solomon build a high-place for Kemosh, the abomination of Moab, on the mount that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of 'Ammon.
011	1KI	011	008	And so did he for all his strange wives, who burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods.
011	1KI	011	009	And the Lord was angry with Solomon; because his heart was turned away from the Lord the God of Israel, who had appeared unto him twice;
011	1KI	011	010	And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods; but he did not keep that which the Lord had commanded.
011	1KI	011	011	And the Lord said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is in thy mind, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I commanded concerning thee: I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.
011	1KI	011	012	Nevertheless in thy days will I not do it, for the sake of David thy father; [but] out of the hand of thy son will I rend it.
011	1KI	011	013	Still all the kingdom will I not rend away: one tribe will I give to thy son on account of David my servant, and on account of Jerusalem which I have chosen.
011	1KI	011	014	And the Lord stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.
011	1KI	011	015	It came to pass, namely, when David was in Edom, when Joab the captain of the army was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom;
011	1KI	011	016	(For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until he had cut off every male in Edom:)
011	1KI	011	017	That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt; but Hadad was then yet a young lad.
011	1KI	011	018	And they arose from Midian, and came to Paran; and they took [some] men with them from Paran, and came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt; who gave him a house, and decreed him a support, and gave him land.
011	1KI	011	019	And Hadad found great favor in the eyes of Pharaoh, so that he gave him for wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Thachpeness the queen.
011	1KI	011	020	And the sister of Thachpeness bore him Genubath his son, whom Thachpeness brought up in Pharaoh's house; and Genubath remained in Pharaoh's house among the sons of Pharaoh.
011	1KI	011	021	And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the army was dead: Hadad said to Pharaoh, Dismiss me, that I may go to my own country.
011	1KI	011	022	Then said Pharaoh unto him, But what dost thou lack with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thy own country? And he answered, Nothing: nevertheless thou must let me go away.
011	1KI	011	023	And God stirred him up [another] adversary, Rezon the son of Elyada', who had fled from Hadad'ezer the king of Zobah his lord;
011	1KI	011	024	And he gathered around him some men, and became captain over a band, when David slew those [of Zobah]; and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus.
011	1KI	011	025	And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.
011	1KI	011	026	Also Jerobo'am the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zeredah, the name of whose mother was Zeru'ah, a widow woman, was a servant of Solomon, and he lifted up his hand against the king.
011	1KI	011	027	And this was the occasion that he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built up the Millo, and closed up the breach of the city of David his father.
011	1KI	011	028	And the man Jerobo'am was a mighty man of valor: and Solomon seeing the young man that he was [also] an industrious worker, he appointed him over all the charge of the house of Joseph.
011	1KI	011	029	And it came to pass at that time when Jerobo'am went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Achiyah the Shilonite found him on the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and these two were alone by themselves in the field;
011	1KI	011	030	And Achiyah caught hold of the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces;
011	1KI	011	031	And he said to Jerobo'am, Take thee ten pieces; for thus hath said the Lord, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and I will give to thee the ten tribes;
011	1KI	011	032	But the one tribe shall remain for him, on account of my servant David, and on account of Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel;
011	1KI	011	033	For the cause that they have forsaken me, and have bowed down to 'Ashtoreth the divinity of the Zidonians, to Kemosh the god of Moab, and to Milcom the god of the children of 'Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do what is right in my eyes, and my statutes and my ordinances, like David his father.
011	1KI	011	034	Nevertheless will I not take the whole kingdom out of his hand; but I will let him remain prince all the days of his life for the sake of David my servant, whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes;
011	1KI	011	035	But I will take the kingdom out of the hand of his son, and I will give it unto thee, even the ten tribes.
011	1KI	011	036	And unto his son will I give one tribe; so that there may remain a government for David my servant at all times before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen for me, to put my name there.
011	1KI	011	037	But thee will I take, and thou shalt reign over all that thy soul may long for; and thou shalt be king over Israel.
011	1KI	011	038	And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I shall command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do what is right in my eyes, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did: that I will be with thee, and build thee a permanent house, as I have built for David, and I will give Israel unto thee.
011	1KI	011	039	And I will afflict the seed of David for this; but not for all times.
011	1KI	011	040	Solomon thereupon sought to put Jerobo'am to death; but Jerobo'am arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak the king of Egypt, and remained in Egypt until the death of Solomon.
011	1KI	011	041	And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did and his wisdom, behold, they are written in the book of the history of Solomon.
011	1KI	011	042	And the days that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel were forty years.
011	1KI	011	043	And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father; and Rehobo'am his son became king in his stead.
011	1KI	012	001	And Rehobo'am went to Shechem; for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.
011	1KI	012	002	And it came to pass, when Jerobo'am the son of Nebat, heard of it, (but he was yet in Egypt, whither he was fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jerobo'am dwelt in Egypt;
011	1KI	012	003	And they had sent and called him;) that Jerobo'am and all the congregation of Israel came, and spoke unto Rehobo'am, saying,
011	1KI	012	004	Thy father made our yoke hard; but do thou now make lighter the hard service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, and we will serve thee.
011	1KI	012	005	And he said unto them, Go away yet for three days, and then return to me. And the people went away.
011	1KI	012	006	Then consulted king Rehobo'am with the old men, that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I should give an answer to this people?
011	1KI	012	007	And they spoke unto him, saying, If thou wilt this day be a servant unto this people, and wilt serve them, and be attentive to them, and speak to them good words; then will they be servants unto thee for all times.
011	1KI	012	008	But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, those who stood before him:
011	1KI	012	009	And he said unto them, What do you counsel how we should give an answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make lighter the yoke which thy father did put upon us?
011	1KI	012	010	Then spoke unto him the young men that were grown up with him, saying, Thus must thou say unto this people that have spoken unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but do thou make it lighter unto us: thus must thou speak unto them, My little finger is thicker than my father's loins.
011	1KI	012	011	And now, if my father hath burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will even add to your yoke; if my father hath chastised you with whips, then will I chastise you with scorpion-thorns.
011	1KI	012	012	When now Jerobo'am and all the people came to Rehobo'am on the third day, as the king had spoken, saying, Return to me on the third day.
011	1KI	012	013	The king answered the people harshly, and forsook the old men's counsel that they had advised him;
011	1KI	012	014	And he spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will even add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpion-thorns.
011	1KI	012	015	Thus the king hearkened not unto the people; for it was so brought about from the Lord, in order that he might fulfill his word, which the Lord had spoken by means of Achiyah the Shilonite unto Jerobo'am the son of Nebat.
011	1KI	012	016	So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people gave the king an answer saying, What portion have we in David? nor have we an inheritance in the son of Jesse; to your tents, O Israel: now see to thy own house, David. So did Israel go away unto their tents.
011	1KI	012	017	But as for the children of Israel who dwelt in the cities of Judah, over them did Rehobo'am reign.
011	1KI	012	018	Then sent king Rehobo'am Adoram, who was over the tribute; but all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehobo'am made speed with all his might to get up into his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.
011	1KI	012	019	So did Israel rebel against the house of David unto this day.
011	1KI	012	020	And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jerobo'am was returned, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, save the tribe of Judah alone.
011	1KI	012	021	And when Rehobo'am was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand chosen men, warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring back the kingdom to Rehobo'am the son of Solomon.
011	1KI	012	022	But the word of God came unto Shema'yah the man of God, saying,
011	1KI	012	023	Say unto Rehobo'am, the son of Solomon, the king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying,
011	1KI	012	024	Thus hath said the Lord, Ye shall not go up, nor fight with your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for from me hath this thing been brought about. And they hearkened to the word of the Lord, and returned to go home, according to the word of the Lord.
011	1KI	012	025	And Jerobo'am built Shechem in the mountain of Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and he went out from there and built Penuel.
011	1KI	012	026	And Jerobo'am said in his heart, Now may the kingdom return to the house of David:
011	1KI	012	027	If this people go up to prepare sacrifices in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem, then may the heart of this people turn again unto their Lord, even unto Rehobo'am the king of Judah, and they might kill me, and return to Rehobo'am the king of Judah.
011	1KI	012	028	Whereupon the king took counsel, and he made two calves of gold, and said unto the people, You have been long enough going up to Jerusalem: behold, here are thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
011	1KI	012	029	And he placed the one in Beth-el, and the other put he in Dan.
011	1KI	012	030	And this thing became a sin; and the people went before the one, as far as Dan.
011	1KI	012	031	And he made a house of the high-places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, who were not of the sons of Levi.
011	1KI	012	032	And Jerobo'am made a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and he offered upon the altar; so did he in Beth-el, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he stationed at Beth-el the priests of the high-places whom he had made.
011	1KI	012	033	So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Beth-el on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, in the month which he had falsely devised of his own heart; and he ordained a feast unto the children of Israel, and he went up to the altar, to burn incense.
011	1KI	013	001	And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the Lord unto Beth-el: while Jerobo'am was standing upon the altar to burn incense.
011	1KI	013	002	And he called out against the altar by the word of the Lord, and he said, O altar, altar, thus hath said the Lord, Behold, a child shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name, and he shall sacrifice upon thee the priests of the high-places that burn incense upon thee, and men's bones shall be burnt upon thee.
011	1KI	013	003	And he gave on the same day a token, saying, This is the token that the Lord hath spoken, Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes which are upon it shall be spilled about.
011	1KI	013	004	And it came to pass, when the king heard the word of the man of God, which he had called out against the altar in Beth-el, that Jerobo'am stretched forth his hand from off the altar, saying, Seize him. And his hand, which he had put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not draw it back to himself.
011	1KI	013	005	The altar also was rent, and the ashes were spilled about from the altar, according to the token which the man of God had given by the word of the Lord.
011	1KI	013	006	And the king commenced and said unto the man of God, Offer but entreaty before the Lord thy God, and pray in behalf of me, that my hand may return to me again. And the man of God offered his entreaty before the Lord, and the king's hand returned to him again, and became as it was before.
011	1KI	013	007	And the king spoke unto the man of God, Come home with me, and take some refreshment, and I will give thee a present.
011	1KI	013	008	But the man of God said unto the king, If thou wert to give me the half of thy house, I would not go in with thee, neither would I eat bread nor drink water in this place;
011	1KI	013	009	For so was it charged me by the word of the Lord, saying, Thou shalt not eat bread, nor drink water, nor return by the way that thou camest.
011	1KI	013	010	So he went by another way, and returned not by the way on which he was come to Beth-el.
011	1KI	013	011	Now there dwelt a certain old prophet in Beth-el; and his son came and told him all the deed that the man of God had done that day in Beth-el: the words [also] which he had spoken unto the king, these too they told to their father.
011	1KI	013	012	And their father spoke unto them, What way did he go? His sons however had seen what way had gone the man of God, who had come from Judah.
011	1KI	013	013	And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass, and he rode away thereon,
011	1KI	013	014	And he went after the man of God, and found him sitting under the oak; and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah? And he said, I am.
011	1KI	013	015	Then said he unto him, Come with me home, and eat bread.
011	1KI	013	016	And he said, I cannot return with thee, nor go in with thee: neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place;
011	1KI	013	017	For a command came to me by the word of the Lord, Thou shalt not eat bread nor drink water there; thou shalt not return to go by the way [also] by which thou camest.
011	1KI	013	018	And he said unto him, I also am a prophet like thee; and an angel spoke unto me by the word of the Lord, saying, Bring him back with thee unto thy house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied unto him.
011	1KI	013	019	So he returned with him, and ate bread in his house, and drank water.
011	1KI	013	020	And it came to pass, as they were sitting at the table, That the word of the Lord came unto the prophet who had brought him back;
011	1KI	013	021	And he called unto the man of God that was come from Judah, saying, Thus hath said the Lord, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the order of the Lord, and hast not kept the commandment which the Lord thy God had commanded thee;
011	1KI	013	022	But didst return, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of which he had spoken to thee, Thou shalt not eat bread, nor drink water: thy dead body shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.
011	1KI	013	023	And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, [to wit,] for the prophet whom he had brought back.
011	1KI	013	024	And when he was gone, a lion met him on the way, and slew him; and his corpse remained cast down on the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also stood by the corpse.
011	1KI	013	025	And, behold, men passed by, and saw the corpse cast down on the way, and the lion standing by the corpse; and they came and spoke of it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.
011	1KI	013	026	And when the prophet that had brought him back from the way heard it, he said, It is the man of God who was disobedient unto the order of the Lord; wherefore the Lord hath given him up unto the lion, who hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the Lord, which he had spoken unto him.
011	1KI	013	027	And he spoke to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled him.
011	1KI	013	028	And he went and found his corpse cast down on the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the corpse: the lion had not eaten the corpse, nor torn the ass.
011	1KI	013	029	And the prophet took up the corpse of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back; and he came to the city of the old prophet, to lament for, and to bury him.
011	1KI	013	030	And he laid his corpse in his own sepulchre; and they lamented over him, “Alas, my brother!”
011	1KI	013	031	And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; beside his bones lay ye my bones;
011	1KI	013	032	For the thing which he called out by the word of the Lord against the altar which is in Beth-el, and against all the houses of the high-places which are in the cities of Samaria, will surely come to pass.
011	1KI	013	033	After this event Jerobo'am returned not from his evil way; but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high-places: whosoever desired it, he consecrated, that he might become one of the priests of the high-places.
011	1KI	013	034	And he became through this thing the cause of sin unto the house of Jerobo'am, and to cause that it was blotted out, and destroyed from off the face of the earth.
011	1KI	014	001	At that time Abiyah the son of Jerobo'am fell sick.
011	1KI	014	002	And Jerobo'am said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that people may not know that thou art the wife of Jerobo'am; and go to Shiloh: behold, there is Achiyahu the prophet, who spoke of me that [I should become] king over this people.
011	1KI	014	003	And take with thee ten loaves of bread and spice-cakes, and a cruise of honey, and go to him: he will tell thee what is to become of the lad.
011	1KI	014	004	And Jerobo'am's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Achiyahu. But Achiyahu was not able to see; for his eyes were set by reason of his high age.
011	1KI	014	005	And the Lord had said unto Achiyahu, Behold the wife of Jerobo'am is coming to inquire a word of thee about her son; for he is sick: thus and thus shalt thou speak unto her; for it will be, when she cometh in, that she will feign to be another.
011	1KI	014	006	And it happened, when Achiyahu heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jerobo'am; why is this, that thou feignest to be another? but I am sent to thee with a hard message.
011	1KI	014	007	Go, say to Jerobo'am, Thus hath said the Lord the God of Israel, Forasmuch as I exalted thee from the midst of the people, and made thee prince over my people Israel,
011	1KI	014	008	And I rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it unto thee; whereas thou hast not been like my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed after me with all his heart, to do only what is right in my eyes;
011	1KI	014	009	And thou hast done more evil than all that were before thee; and thou art gone and hast made unto thyself other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and me hast thou cast behind thy back:
011	1KI	014	010	Therefore, behold, will I bring evil upon the house of Jerobo'am, and will cut off from Jerobo'am every male, [also] the guarded and fortified in Israel; and I will sweep out after the house of Jerobo'am as one sweepeth away the dung till there be nothing left of it.
011	1KI	014	011	Him that dieth of Jerobo'am in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the heavens eat; for the Lord hath spoken it.
011	1KI	014	012	But thou, arise now, go to thy own house: when thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die.
011	1KI	014	013	And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him; for this one alone shall come of Jerobo'am's [family] to the grave; because there hath been found in him some good thing toward the Lord the God of Israel in the house of Jerobo'am.
011	1KI	014	014	And the Lord will raise up unto himself a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jerobo'am what is here this day, and what will be after this.
011	1KI	014	015	And the Lord will smite Israel, as the reed is shaken in the water, and he will pull up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and will scatter them on the other side of the river; because they have made their groves, provoking the Lord to anger.
011	1KI	014	016	And he will give Israel up for the sake of the sins of Jerobo'am, who did sin, and who induced Israel to sin.
011	1KI	014	017	And Jerobo'am's wife arose, and departed, and came to Thirzah; [and] as she came to the threshold of the door, the lad died:
011	1KI	014	018	And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the Lord, which he had spoken by the hand of his servant Achiyahu the prophet.
011	1KI	014	019	And the rest of the acts of Jerobo'am, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
011	1KI	014	020	And the days which Jerobo'am reigned were two and twenty years; and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son became king in his stead.
011	1KI	014	021	And Rehobo'am the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehobo'am was forty and one years old when he became king, and seventeen years did he reign in Jerusalem, the city which the Lord had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was Na'amah the 'Ammonitess.
011	1KI	014	022	And Judah did what is evil in the eyes of the Lord, and they moved him to wrath more than all that their fathers had done, with their sins which they committed.
011	1KI	014	023	And they also built themselves high-places, and standing images, and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree.
011	1KI	014	024	And sodomites also were in the land: they acted in accordance with all the abominable deeds of the nations which the Lord had driven out before the children of Israel.
011	1KI	014	025	And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehobo'am, that Shishak the king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem:
011	1KI	014	026	And he took away the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king's house; yea, every thing did he take away; and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
011	1KI	014	027	And king Rehobo'am made in their stead shields of copper, and committed them for keeping into the hand of the chiefs of the runners, who kept guard at the door of the king's house.
011	1KI	014	028	And it happened whenever the king went into the house of the Lord, that the runners used to bear them, and carried them then back into the apartment of the runners.
011	1KI	014	029	And the rest of the acts of Rehobo'am, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah.
011	1KI	014	030	And there was war between Rehobo'am and Jerobo'am all the days.
011	1KI	014	031	And Rehobo'am slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And his mother's name was Na'amah the 'Ammonitess. And Abiyam his son became king in his stead.
011	1KI	015	001	Now in the eighteenth year of king Jerobo'am the son of Nebat became Abiyam king over Judah.
011	1KI	015	002	Three years he reigned in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Ma'achah, the daughter of Abishalom.
011	1KI	015	003	And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him; and his heart was not entire with the Lord his God, like the heart of David his father.
011	1KI	015	004	Nevertheless for the sake of David did the Lord his God give him a rule in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to allow Jerusalem to exist.
011	1KI	015	005	Because David did what is right in the eyes of the Lord, and turned not aside from all that he had commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriyah the Hittite.
011	1KI	015	006	And there had been war between Rehobo'am and Jerobo'am all the days of his life.
011	1KI	015	007	And the rest of the acts of Abiyam, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah. And there was [also] war between Abiyam and Jerobo'am.
011	1KI	015	008	And Abiyam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and Assa his son became king in his stead.
011	1KI	015	009	And in the twentieth year of Jerobo'am the king of Israel became Assa king over Judah.
011	1KI	015	010	And forty and one years did he reign in Jerusalem. And the name of his mother was Ma'achah, the daughter of Abishalom.
011	1KI	015	011	And Assa did what is right in the eyes of the Lord, like David his father.
011	1KI	015	012	And he put away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols which his fathers had made.
011	1KI	015	013	And also Ma'achah his mother, even her he removed from being queen; because she had made a scandalous image for the grove; and Assa cut down her scandalous image, and burnt it by the brook Kidron.
011	1KI	015	014	But the high-places were not removed; nevertheless Assa's heart was entire with the Lord all his days.
011	1KI	015	015	And he brought the things which his father had sanctified, and his own sanctified things, into the house of the Lord, silver, and gold, and vessels.
011	1KI	015	016	And there was war between Assa and Ba'sha the king of Israel all their days.
011	1KI	015	017	And Ba'sha the king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, in order not to suffer any one to go out or come in to Assa the king of Judah.
011	1KI	015	018	Then did Assa take all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king's house, and gave them into the hand of his servants; and king Assa sent them to Ben-hadad, the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Chesyon, the king of Syria, who dwelt in Damascus, saying,
011	1KI	015	019	A covenant is between me and thee, [as] between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold; go and do break thy covenant with Ba'sha the king of Israel, that he may withdraw from me.
011	1KI	015	020	And Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Assa, and sent the captains of the armies which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote 'Iyon, and Dan, and Abel-beth-ma'achah, and the whole of Kinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.
011	1KI	015	021	And it came to pass, when Ba'sha heard this, that he left off the building of Ramah, and remained in Tirzah.
011	1KI	015	022	Then king Assa called together by proclamation all Judah, none being exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and its timber, wherewith Ba'sha had built; and king Assa built with them Geba' of Benjamin, and Mizpah.
011	1KI	015	023	And the rest of all the acts of Assa, and all his mighty deeds, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah. Nevertheless in the time of his old age he became diseased in his feet.
011	1KI	015	024	And Assa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son became king in his stead.
011	1KI	015	025	And Nadab the son of Jerobo'am became king over Israel in the second year of Assa the king of Judah; and he reigned over Israel two years.
011	1KI	015	026	And he did what is evil in the eyes of the Lord, and he walked in the way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he had induced Israel to sin.
011	1KI	015	027	And Ba'sha the son of Achiyah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Ba'sha smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines: while Nadab and all Israel were besieging Gibbethon.
011	1KI	015	028	And Ba'sha slew him in the third year of Assa the king of Judah, and became king in his stead.
011	1KI	015	029	And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the house of Jerobo'am; he left not any that breathed unto Jerobo'am, until he had destroyed him, according to the word of the Lord, which he had spoken by his servant Achiyah the Shilonite;
011	1KI	015	030	Because of the sins of Jerobo'am which he had sinned, and through which he had induced Israel to sin, by his provoking wherewith he provoked the Lord the God of Israel to anger.
011	1KI	015	031	And the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
011	1KI	015	032	And there was war between Assa and Ba'sha the king of Israel all their days.
011	1KI	015	033	In the third year of Assa the king of Judah became Ba'sha the son of Achiyah king over all Israel, in Thirzah, [for] twenty and four years.
011	1KI	015	034	And he did what is evil in the eyes of the Lord, and walked in the way of Jerobo'am, and in his sin wherewith he had induced Israel to sin.
011	1KI	016	001	Then came the word of the Lord to Jehu the son of Chanani against Ba'sha, saying,
011	1KI	016	002	Forasmuch as I lifted thee up out of the dust, and I set thee as prince over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the way of Jerobo'am, and hast induced my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins:
011	1KI	016	003	Behold, I will sweep out after Ba'sha, and after his house; and I will render thy house like the house of Jerobo'am the son of Nebat;
011	1KI	016	004	Him that dieth of Ba'sha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth of his in the field shall the fowls of the heavens eat.
011	1KI	016	005	And the rest of the acts of Ba'sha, and what he did, and his mighty deeds, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
011	1KI	016	006	And Ba'sha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Thirzah: and Elah his son became king in his stead.
011	1KI	016	007	And also by the hand of Jehu the son of Chanani, the prophet, came the word of the Lord against Ba'sha, and against his house, both for all the evil that he did in the eyes of the Lord, to provoke him to anger with the work of his hands, thus being like the house of Jerobo'am; and because he had killed him.
011	1KI	016	008	In the twenty and sixth year of Assa the king of Judah became Elah the son of Ba'sha king over Israel in Thirzah, [for] two years.
011	1KI	016	009	And there conspired against him his servant Zimri, captain of half the chariots, as he was in Thirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was set over the house in Thirzah.
011	1KI	016	010	And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Assa the king of Judah, and became king in his stead.
011	1KI	016	011	And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he slew all the house of Ba'sha: he left him not a single male, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends.
011	1KI	016	012	Thus did Zimri exterminate all the house of Ba'sha, according to the word of the Lord, which he had spoken against Ba'sha by the agency of Jehu the prophet,
011	1KI	016	013	For all the sins of Ba'sha, and the sins of Elah his son, by which they had sinned, and by which they had induced Israel to sin, to provoke the Lord the God of Israel to anger with their vanities.
011	1KI	016	014	Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
011	1KI	016	015	In the twenty and seventh year of Assa the king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Thirzah: and the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.
011	1KI	016	016	And when the people that were encamped heard it said, Zimri hath conspired, and hath also slain the king: all Israel made 'Omri, the captain of the army, king over Israel on that day in the camp.
011	1KI	016	017	And 'Omri went up, and all Israel with him from Gibbethon, and they besieged Thirzah.
011	1KI	016	018	And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was captured, that he went into the strong-hold of the king's house, and burnt the king's house over him with fire, and he died;
011	1KI	016	019	For his sins which he had sinned, in doing what is evil in the eyes of the Lord, to walk in the way of Jerobo'am, and in his sin which he did, to induce Israel to sin.
011	1KI	016	020	And the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his conspiracy that he contrived, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
011	1KI	016	021	At that time were the people of Israel divided into two parts: one half of the people followed Thibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and the other half followed 'Omri.
011	1KI	016	022	But the people that followed 'Omri prevailed against the people that followed Thibni the son of Ginath: and Thibni [also] died, and 'Omri became king.
011	1KI	016	023	In the thirty and first year of Assa the king of Judah became 'Omri king over Israel, [for] twelve years; in Thirzah he reigned six years.
011	1KI	016	024	And he bought the mount Samaria, of Shemer for two talents of silver, and built on the mount, and called the name of the city which he had built, after the name of Shemer, the Lord of the mount, Samaria.
011	1KI	016	025	And 'Omri did what is evil in the eyes of the Lord, and did worse than all that were before him.
011	1KI	016	026	And he walked in all the way of Jerobo'am the son of Nebat, and in his sin wherewith he induced Israel to sin, to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger with their vanities.
011	1KI	016	027	Now the rest of the acts of 'Omri which he did, and his mighty deeds that he displayed, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
011	1KI	016	028	And 'Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and Achab his son became king in his stead.
011	1KI	016	029	And Achab the son of 'omri became king over Israel in the thirty and eighth year of Assa the king of Judah; and Achab the son of 'Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.
011	1KI	016	030	And Achab the son of 'Omri did what is evil in the eyes of the Lord more than all that had been before him.
011	1KI	016	031	And it came to pass, as if it had been too light a thing for him to walk in the sins of Jerobo'am the son of Nebat, that he took for wife Izebel the daughter of Ethba'al the king of the Zidonians, and went and served Ba'al, and worshipped him.
011	1KI	016	032	And he erected an altar for Ba'al in the house of Ba'al, which he had built in Samaria.
011	1KI	016	033	And Achab made a grove; and Achab did yet more, so as to provoke the Lord the God of Israel to anger, than all the kings of Israel that had been before him.
011	1KI	016	034	In his days did Chiel the Beth-elite build Jericho: with Abiram his first-born laid he the foundation thereof, and with Segub his youngest son set he up the gates thereof, according to the word of the Lord, which he had spoken by means of Joshua the son of Nun.
011	1KI	017	001	Then said Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gil'ad, unto Achab, As the Lord the God of Israel liveth, before whom I have stood, there shall not be in these years dew or rain, except according to my word.
011	1KI	017	002	And the word of the Lord came unto him, saying,
011	1KI	017	003	Go away from here, and turn thyself eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Kerith, which is to the east of the Jordan.
011	1KI	017	004	And it shall be, that out of the brook shalt thou drink; and the ravens have I ordained to sustain thee there.
011	1KI	017	005	And he went and did according to the word of the Lord; and he went and remained by the brook Kerith, that is to the east of the Jordan.
011	1KI	017	006	And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening: and out of the brook he used to drink.
011	1KI	017	007	And it came to pass after a while that the brook dried up; because there had been no rain in the land.
011	1KI	017	008	And the word of the Lord came unto him, saying,
011	1KI	017	009	Arise, go unto Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and remain there: behold, I have ordained there a widow-woman to sustain thee.
011	1KI	017	010	So he arose and went to Zarephath; and when he came to the gate of the city, behold, there was there a widow-woman gathering sticks of wood: and he called her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.
011	1KI	017	011	And as she went to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thy hand.
011	1KI	017	012	And she said, As the Lord thy God liveth, I have nothing baked, but a handful of meal in a jar, and a little oil in a cruise: and, behold, I am gathering a couple of sticks, that I may go in and prepare it for me and my son; and when we have eaten it, we shall have to die.
011	1KI	017	013	And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said; but make me thereof a little cake at first, and bring it out unto me, and for thee and for thy son shalt thou prepare [something] afterward.
011	1KI	017	014	For thus hath said the Lord the God of Israel, The jar of meal shall not fail, neither shall the cruise of oil diminish, until the day that the Lord giveth rain upon the face of the earth.
011	1KI	017	015	And she went and did according to the word of Elijah: and she, and he, and her household, did eat [many] days.
011	1KI	017	016	The jar of meal failed not, nor did the cruise of oil diminish, according to the word of the Lord, which he had spoken through means of Elijah.
011	1KI	017	017	And it came to pass after these events, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness became very severe, until that at length there was no breath left in him.
011	1KI	017	018	And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O man of God? thou art come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son!
011	1KI	017	019	And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into the upper chamber, in which he abode, and he laid him upon his own bed.
011	1KI	017	020	And he called unto the Lord, and said, O Lord my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?
011	1KI	017	021	And he stretched himself out over the child three times, and called unto the Lord, and said, O Lord my God, let, I pray thee, the soul of this child return again within him.
011	1KI	017	022	And the Lord listened to the voice of Elijah: and the soul of the child returned into him, and he revived.
011	1KI	017	023	And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the upper chamber into the house, and gave him unto his mother; and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.
011	1KI	017	024	And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this do I know, that thou art a man of God, and the word of the Lord in thy mouth is truth.
011	1KI	018	001	And it lasted many days, when the word of the Lord came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, show thyself unto Achab; and I will give rain upon the face of the earth.
011	1KI	018	002	And Elijah went to show himself unto Achab; and the famine was grievous in Samaria.
011	1KI	018	003	And Achab called 'Obadiah, who was the superintendent of the house; —(now 'Obadiah feared the Lord greatly;
011	1KI	018	004	And it happened, when Izebel cut off the prophets of the Lord, that 'Obadiah took a hundred prophets, and hid them fifty each in one cave, and provided them with bread and water;)
011	1KI	018	005	And Achab said unto 'Obadiah, Go through the land, unto all the springs of water, and unto all the brooks, peradventure we may find grass and keep alive horse and mule, that we lose not all the cattle.
011	1KI	018	006	So they divided between them the land to pass through it: Achab went one way by himself alone, and 'Obadiah went another way by himself alone.
011	1KI	018	007	And as 'Obadiah was on the way, behold, Elijah came toward him; and he recognized him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou here indeed, my Lord Elijah?
011	1KI	018	008	And he said unto him, I am: go, say unto thy Lord, Behold, Elijah is here.
011	1KI	018	009	And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldst deliver thy servant into the hand of Achab, to slay me?
011	1KI	018	010	As the Lord thy God liveth, there is not a nation or kingdom whither my Lord hath not sent to seek thee; and when they said, He is not here: he caused that kingdom and nation to take an oath, that no one could find thee.
011	1KI	018	011	And now thou sayest, Go, say unto thy Lord, Behold, here is Elijah.
011	1KI	018	012	And it may come to pass, that, when I go from thee, the spirit of the Lord may carry thee whither I know not; and when I come to inform Achab, and he cannot find thee, he will slay me; but I thy servant have feared the Lord from my youth.
011	1KI	018	013	Hath it not been told unto my Lord what I did when Izebel slew the prophets of the Lord, how I hid a hundred men of the prophets of the Lord, fifty each in one cave, and provided them with bread and water?
011	1KI	018	014	And now thou sayest, Go say to thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here: and he will slay me.
011	1KI	018	015	Then said Elijah, As the Lord of hosts liveth, before whom I have stood, surely today will I show myself unto him.
011	1KI	018	016	So 'Ohadiah went to meet Achab, and he told it to him; and Achab went to meet Elijah.
011	1KI	018	017	And it came to pass, when Achab saw Elijah, that Achab said unto him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?
011	1KI	018	018	And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, through your forsaking the commandments of the Lord, and because thou hast followed the Be'alim.
011	1KI	018	019	And now send, assemble unto me all Israel at Mount Carmel, and the prophets of Ba'al four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the grove four hundred, who eat at the table of Izebel.
011	1KI	018	020	And Achab sent round among all the children of Israel, and he assembled the prophets at Mount Carmel.
011	1KI	018	021	And Elijah approached unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between the two opinions? if the Lord be the God, follow him; and if Ba'al—follow him. And the people answered him not a word.
011	1KI	018	022	And Elijah said unto the people, I have been left a prophet of the Lord by myself alone; but the prophets of Ba'al are four hundred and fifty men.
011	1KI	018	023	Therefore let there be given unto us two bullocks; and let them choose for themselves the one bullock, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire to it: and I will prepare the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire to it.
011	1KI	018	024	And do ye call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the Lord: and it shall be that the God who answereth by fire, he shall be the [true] God. And all the people answered and said, The proposal is good.
011	1KI	018	025	And Elijah said unto the prophets of Ba'al, Choose you for yourselves the one bullock, and prepare it first; for ye are the many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire to it.
011	1KI	018	026	And they took the bullock which he had given to them, and they prepared it; and they called on the name of Ba'al from morning even until noon, saying, O Ba'al, answer us; but there was no voice, nor any answer: and they danced about the altar which had been made.
011	1KI	018	027	And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked at them, and said, Call with a loud voice; for he is a god; either he is holding council, or he is busy in some pursuit, or he is on a journey; or peradventure he sleepeth, and may thus awaken.
011	1KI	018	028	And they called with a loud voice and cut themselves after their custom with knives and spears, till the blood gushed out over them.
011	1KI	018	029	And it came to pass, when midday was past, that they practised their follies until near [the time of] the offering of the evening-sacrifice; but there was neither voice, nor any answer, nor any perceptible sound.
011	1KI	018	030	And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me: and all the people came near unto him; and he repaired the altar of the Lord that had been torn down.
011	1KI	018	031	And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the Lord was come, saying, Israel shall be thy name.
011	1KI	018	032	And he built of the stones an altar in the name of the Lord; and he made a trench as great as would contain two seahs of seed round about the altar.
011	1KI	018	033	And he put in order the wood, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid them on the wood,
011	1KI	018	034	And he said. Fill four jars with water; and they had to pour it on the burnt-offering, and on the wood: and he said, Do it the second time: and they did it the second time: and he said, Do it the third time; and they did it the third time.
011	1KI	018	035	And the water ran round about the altar; and the trench also he filled with water.
011	1KI	018	036	And it came to pass, at [the time of] the offering of the evening-sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, O Lord, God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, this day let it be known that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that at thy word I have done all these things.
011	1KI	018	037	Answer me, O Lord, answer me, and let all this people know that thou, O Lord, art the [true] God, and thou wilt [then] have turned their heart back again.
011	1KI	018	038	And there fell a fire of the Lord, and consumed the burnt-offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust; and the water also that was in the trench did it lick up.
011	1KI	018	039	And when all the people saw this, they fell on their faces; and they said, the Lord—he is the God; the Lord—he is the God.
011	1KI	018	040	And Elijah said unto them, Seize the prophets of Ba'al; not one of them must escape; and they seized them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slaughtered them there.
011	1KI	018	041	And Elijah said unto Achab, Go up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain.
011	1KI	018	042	So Achab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down toward the earth, and put his face between his knees;
011	1KI	018	043	And he said to his servant, Go up, I pray thee, look in the direction of the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, Not the least [is visible]. And he said, Go again, seven times.
011	1KI	018	044	And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there is a little cloud like a man's hand arising out of the sea. And he said, Go up, say unto Achab, Harness up [thy chariot], and come down, that the rain may not detain thee.
011	1KI	018	045	And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heavens were blackened with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Achab rode, and went to Yizre'el.
011	1KI	018	046	And the inspiration of the Lord came over Elijah, and he girded up his loins; and he ran before Achab up to the entrance of Yizre'el.
011	1KI	019	001	And Achab told Izebel all that Elijah had done, and withal that he had slain all the prophets with the sword.
011	1KI	019	002	Then sent Izebel a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So may the gods do to me, and may they thus continue, if about this time tomorrow I do not render thy life as the life of any one of them.
011	1KI	019	003	And when he saw this, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beer-sheba', which belongeth to Judah, and he left his young man there.
011	1KI	019	004	But he himself went forward into the wilderness a day's journey, and he came and sat down under a certain broom-bush: and he requested for himself to die; and he said, It is enough, now, O Lord, take away my soul; for I am not better than my fathers.
011	1KI	019	005	And he laid himself down and slept under a certain broom-bush, and, behold then, an angel was touching him, and said unto him, Arise, eat.
011	1KI	019	006	And he looked about, and, behold, there was at his head a cake baked on coals, and a cruise of water; and he ate and drank, and laid himself down again.
011	1KI	019	007	And the angel of the Lord came again, the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise, eat; because the journey is yet far for thee.
011	1KI	019	008	And he arose, and ate and drank; and he went on the strength of that eating forty days and forty nights unto the mount of God, Horeb.
011	1KI	019	009	And he came there unto a cave, and remained there over night: and, behold, the word of the Lord came to him, and said unto him, What dost thou here, Elijah?
011	1KI	019	010	And he said, I have been very zealous for the Lord, the God of hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thy altars have they thrown down, and thy prophets have they slain with the sword: and I am left by myself alone, and they have sought my life, to take it away.
011	1KI	019	011	And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the Lord: and, behold, the Lord passed by, and a wind, great and strong, rending the mountains, and breaking in pieces the rocks [went] before the Lord; but not in the wind was the Lord: and after the wind was an earthquake: but not in the earthquake was the Lord;
011	1KI	019	012	And after the earthquake was a fire; but not in the fire was the Lord; and after the fire was the sound of a soft whisper.
011	1KI	019	013	And it came to pass, when Elijah heard it, that he concealed his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entrance of the cave: and, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What dost thou here, Elijah?
011	1KI	019	014	And he said, I have been very zealous for the Lord, the God of hosts; because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thy altars have they thrown down, and thy prophets have they slain with the sword: and I am left by myself alone, and they have sought my life, to take it away.
011	1KI	019	015	And the Lord said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus; and go, anoint Chazael to be king over Syria;
011	1KI	019	016	And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel; and Elisha' the son of Shaphat of Abel-mecholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy stead.
011	1KI	019	017	And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of Chazael shall Jehu slay; and him that escapeth the sword of Jehu shall Elisha' slay.
011	1KI	019	018	And I will leave in Israel seven thousand, all the knees which have not been bent unto Ba'al, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.
011	1KI	019	019	And he departed thence, and found Elisha' the son of Shaphat, who was ploughing; twelve yoke of oxen were before him, and he was with the twelfth: and Elijah passed up to him, and cast his mantle toward him.
011	1KI	019	020	And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss but my father and my mother, and I will [then] follow thee: and he said unto him, Go, return; for what have I done to thee?
011	1KI	019	021	And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and with the instruments of the oxen he boiled the flesh for them, and he gave it unto the people, and they did eat; and then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him.
011	1KI	020	001	And Ben-hadad the king of Syria assembled all his host together: and thirty and two kings were with him, and horses, and chariots; and he went up and besieged Samaria, and made war against it.
011	1KI	020	002	And he sent messengers to Achab the king of Israel into the city;
011	1KI	020	003	And he said unto him, Thus hath said Ben-hadad, Thy silver and thy gold are mine; thy wives also and thy children, even the best, are mine.
011	1KI	020	004	And the king of Israel answered and said, According to thy word, my Lord, O king, thine am I, and all that I have.
011	1KI	020	005	And the messengers returned, and said, Thus hath said Ben-hadad, to say [to thee], I have indeed sent unto thee, saying, Thou shalt give unto me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children;
011	1KI	020	006	Nevertheless, about this time tomorrow will I send my servants unto thee, and they shall search through thy house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in thy eyes, they shall place it in their hand, and take it away.
011	1KI	020	007	Then did the king of Israel call for all the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see that this man seeketh mischief; for he hath sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold, and I have not refused them to him.
011	1KI	020	008	And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Thou must not hearken, nor consent.
011	1KI	020	009	Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Ben-hadad, Say to my lord the king, all that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first will I do; but this thing I am not able to do. And the messengers went away, and brought him word again.
011	1KI	020	010	And Ben-hadad then sent unto him, and said, May the gods do so unto me, and continue to do so, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that are in my train.
011	1KI	020	011	And the king of Israel answered and said, Speak, Let him that girdeth on the armor not boast himself as he that putteth it off.
011	1KI	020	012	And it came to pass, when he heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said unto his servants, Get ready for the attack. And they got ready for the attack against the city.
011	1KI	020	013	And, behold, there approached a certain prophet unto Achab the king of Israel, and said, Thus hath said the Lord, Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into thy hand this day; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord.
011	1KI	020	014	And Achab said, By whom? And he said, Thus hath said the Lord, By means of the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then said he, Who shall order the battle? And he said, Thou.
011	1KI	020	015	He then numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty-two: and after them he numbered all the people, all the children of Israel, seven thousand strong.
011	1KI	020	016	And they went out at midday; while Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him.
011	1KI	020	017	And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out at first; and Ben-hadad sent out, and they told him, saying, Some men are come out of Samaria.
011	1KI	020	018	And he said, If they be come out for peace, catch them alive; and if they be come out for war, alive must ye catch them.
011	1KI	020	019	So these, the young men of the princes of the provinces, came out of the city, with the army which followed them.
011	1KI	020	020	And they slew every one his man; and the Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them: and Ben-hadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with the horsemen.
011	1KI	020	021	And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and inflicted on the Syrians a great defeat.
011	1KI	020	022	And the prophet approached unto the king of Israel, and said unto him, Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou hast to do; for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee.
011	1KI	020	023	And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Gods of the mountains are their gods; therefore they prevailed over us; but let us fight against them in the plain, [and see] whether we shall not prevail over them.
011	1KI	020	024	But do this thing, Remove the kings, every one from his place, and appoint governors in their rooms;
011	1KI	020	025	And thou, number for thyself an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight against them in the plain, [and see] whether we shall prevail over them. And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so.
011	1KI	020	026	And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Ben-hadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to the war with Israel.
011	1KI	020	027	And the children of Israel were numbered, and provisioned, and went [out] against them: and the children of Israel encamped opposite to them like two little flocks of goats; but the Syrians filled the country.
011	1KI	020	028	And there approached the man of God, and spoke unto the king of Israel, and said, Thus hath said the Lord, Forasmuch as the Syrians have said, “A God of the hills is the Lord, but he is not God of the valleys”: will I deliver all this great multitude into thy hand; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
011	1KI	020	029	And they encamped one opposite the other for seven days. And it happened, that on the seventh day the battle took place: and the children of Israel smote the Syrians a hundred thousand men on foot in one day.
011	1KI	020	030	But those that were left fled to Aphek, into the city; but the city-wall fell upon the twenty and seven thousand men that had been left. And Ben-hadad fled, and came into the city, into an innermost chamber.
011	1KI	020	031	And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are kindly kings; let us, we pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel; peradventure he may save thy life.
011	1KI	020	032	So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Ben-hadad hath said, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is my brother.
011	1KI	020	033	Now the men took it for a good sign, and hastened and caught at his word, whether it was his earnest; and they said, Thy brother Ben-hadad! But he said, Go ye, bring him. Then came Ben-hadad forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.
011	1KI	020	034	And he said unto him, The cities, which my father took from thy father, will I restore; and thou canst lay out for thyself streets in Damascus, as my father laid out in Samaria. “And I for my part will send thee away with this covenant.” So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away.
011	1KI	020	035	And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his companion, By the word of the Lord, smite me, I pray thee. But the man refused to smite him.
011	1KI	020	036	Then said he unto him, Forasmuch as thou hast not obeyed the voice of the Lord, behold, when thou goest away from me, a lion shall slay thee. And he went away from him, when a lion found him, and slew him.
011	1KI	020	037	Then he met with another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, smiting and wounding [him].
011	1KI	020	038	And the prophet then went, and placed himself before the king on the way, and disguised himself with a bandage over his eyes.
011	1KI	020	039	And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king, and said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought unto me a man, and said, Guard this man; if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be [forfeit] for his life, or else thou shalt weigh me down a talent of silver.
011	1KI	020	040	But it happened as thy servant was Busy here and there, that he was gone. And the king of Israel said unto him, So is thy sentence: thou thyself hast decided it.
011	1KI	020	041	And he hastened, and removed the bandage from his eyes; and the king of Israel recognized him that he was one of the prophets.
011	1KI	020	042	And he said unto him, Thus hath said the Lord, Because thou hast let go out of thy hand the man whom I had caught in my net, therefore shall thy life be the forfeit for his life, and thy people for his people.
011	1KI	020	043	And the king of Israel went to his house low-spirited and displeased, and he came to Samaria.
011	1KI	021	001	And it came to pass after these events, that Naboth the Yizre'elite had a vineyard, which was in Yizre'el, near the palace of Achab the king of Samaria.
011	1KI	021	002	And Achab spoke unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that it may serve me for a herb-garden, because it is near unto my house; and I will give thee in its stead a vineyard better than it; [or,] if it seem good in thy eyes, I will give thee the money, the value of the same.
011	1KI	021	003	And Naboth said to Achab, Far be it from me before the Lord, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.
011	1KI	021	004	And Achab came into his house low-spirited and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Yizre'elite had spoken to him, when he said, I will not give unto thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid himself down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no food.
011	1KI	021	005	But Izebel his wife came to him, and spoke unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad! and why eatest thou no food?
011	1KI	021	006	And he said unto her, Because I spoke unto Naboth the Yizre'elite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee a vineyard in its stead; but he hath said, I will not give unto thee my vineyard.
011	1KI	021	007	Then said unto him Izebel his wife, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, eat bread, and let thy heart be merry: I will myself give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Yizre'elite.
011	1KI	021	008	So she wrote letters in Achab's name, and sealed them with his seal; and she sent the letters unto the elders and unto the nobles who were in his city, and who dwelt near Naboth.
011	1KI	021	009	And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and cause Naboth to sit at the head of the people;
011	1KI	021	010	And seat two men, worthless fellows, opposite to him, and let them bear witness against him, saying, Thou hast blasphemed God and the king; and then lead him forth, and stone him, that he may die.
011	1KI	021	011	And the men of his city, the elders and the nobles, those who dwelt in his city, did as Izebel had sent unto them, as was written in the letters which she had sent unto them.
011	1KI	021	012	They proclaimed a fast, and caused Naboth to sit at the head of the people.
011	1KI	021	013	And there came in two men, worthless fellows, and seated themselves opposite to him; and these worthless men testified against him, against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth hath blasphemed God and the king. Then they led him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.
011	1KI	021	014	And they sent to Izebel, saying, Naboth hath been stoned, and is dead.
011	1KI	021	015	And it came to pass, when Izebel heard that Naboth had been stoned, and was dead, that Izebel said to Achab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Yizre'elite, which he refused to give thee for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.
011	1KI	021	016	And it came to pass, when Achab heard that Naboth was dead, that Achab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Yizre'elite, to take possession of it.
011	1KI	021	017	And the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
011	1KI	021	018	Arise, go down to meet Achab the king of Israel, who is in Samaria; behold he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to take possession of it.
011	1KI	021	019	And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus hath said the Lord, Hast thou murdered, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus hath said the Lord, In the place where the dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall the dogs lick thy blood, yes, thine also.
011	1KI	021	020	And Achab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O my enemy? And he answered, I have found thee: because thou hast sold thyself to do what is evil in the eyes of the Lord.
011	1KI	021	021	Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and I will sweep out after thee, and will cut off from Achab every male, and the guarded and fortified in Israel,
011	1KI	021	022	And I will make thy house like the house of Jerobo'am the son of Nebat, and like the house of Ba'sha the son of Achiyah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked [me] to anger, and induced Israel to sin.
011	1KI	021	023	And also concerning Izebel hath the Lord spoken, saying, The dogs shall eat Izebel in the valley of Yizre'el.
011	1KI	021	024	Him that dieth of Achab in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the heavens eat.
011	1KI	021	025	But indeed there was none like unto Achab, who sold himself to do what is evil in the eyes of the Lord, to which Izebel his wife incited him.
011	1KI	021	026	And he acted very abominably in following the idols, in all things just as had done the Emorites, whom the Lord had driven out from before the children of Israel.
011	1KI	021	027	And it came to pass, when Achab heard these words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and slept in the sackcloth, and walked about barefooted.
011	1KI	021	028	And the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
011	1KI	021	029	Hast thou seen how Achab hath humbled himself before me? therefore, because he hath humbled himself before me, will I not bring the evil in his days: in the days of his son will I bring the evil upon his house.
011	1KI	022	001	And they remained [at rest] three years, there being no war between Syria and Israel.
011	1KI	022	002	And it came to pass in the third year that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.
011	1KI	022	003	And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in Gil'ad is ours, and we remain idle, without taking it out of the hand of the king of Syria?
011	1KI	022	004	And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to the battle against Ramoth-gil'ad? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I [will be] like thee, my people like thy people, my horses like thy horses.
011	1KI	022	005	And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray thee, today [first] of the word of the Lord.
011	1KI	022	006	Then assembled the king of Israel the prophets, about four hundred men, and said unto them, shall I go against Ramoth-gil'ad to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; and the Lord will deliver [it] into the hand of the king.
011	1KI	022	007	And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the Eternal besides, that we might inquire of him?
011	1KI	022	008	And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, by whom we might inquire of the Lord; but I hate him; for he will never prophesy good concerning me, but evil: [it is] Michayhu the son of Yimlah. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.
011	1KI	022	009	Then called the king of Israel a certain officer, and said, Hasten hither Michayhu the son of Yimlah.
011	1KI	022	010	And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne, dressed in their regal garments, in a threshing-floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.
011	1KI	022	011	And Zedekiah the son of Kena'anah had made himself horns of iron; and he said, Thus hath said the Lord, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou have made an end of them.
011	1KI	022	012	And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gil'ad, and prosper; and the Lord will deliver it into the king's hand.
011	1KI	022	013	And the messenger that went to call Michayhu spoke unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets are with one voice good for the king: do let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of any one of them, and speak something good.
011	1KI	022	014	And Michayhu said, As the Lord liveth, truly, what the Lord may say unto me, that will I speak.
011	1KI	022	015	And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Michayhu, shall we go against Ramoth-gil'ad to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go up, and prosper; and may the Lord deliver it into the hand of the king.
011	1KI	022	016	And the king said unto him, How many times yet must I adjure thee that thou shalt not speak to me anything but the truth in the name of the Lord?
011	1KI	022	017	And he said, I saw all Israel scattered over the mountains, as flocks that have not a shepherd: and the Lord said, These have no master; let them return every man to his house in peace.
011	1KI	022	018	And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not say unto thee that he would not prophesy concerning me any good, but [only] evil?
011	1KI	022	019	And he said, Therefore hear thou the word of the Lord, I saw the Lord sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right and on his left.
011	1KI	022	020	And the Lord said, Who will persuade Achab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gil'ad! And one said, In this manner, and another said, In that manner.
011	1KI	022	021	And there came forth a spirit, and placed himself before the Lord, and said, I will persuade him. And the Lord said unto him, Wherewith?
011	1KI	022	022	And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou wilt persuade him, and also prevail: go forth, and do so.
011	1KI	022	023	And now, behold, the Lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets; but the Lord hath spoken evil concerning thee.
011	1KI	022	024	And Zedekiah, the son of Kena'anah, went near, and struck Michayhu on the cheek, and said, Which way passed the Spirit of the Lord away from me to speak with thee!
011	1KI	022	025	And Michayhu said, Behold, thou shalt see it on that day, when thou shalt go into the innermost chamber to hide thyself.
011	1KI	022	026	And the king of Israel said, Take Michayhu, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and unto Joash the king's son;
011	1KI	022	027	And say, Thus hath said the king, Put this man in the prison, and feed him with sparing bread and with sparing water, until I come home in peace.
011	1KI	022	028	And Michayhu said, If thou return at all in peace, then hath the Lord not spoken through me. And he said, Hear it, O all ye nations!
011	1KI	022	029	So the king of Israel went up with Jehoshaphat the king of Judah to Ramoth-gil'ad.
011	1KI	022	030	And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but do thou put on thy regal garments. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.
011	1KI	022	031	And the king of Syria had commanded the captains over his chariots, thirty-two [in number], saying, Fight neither with a small nor a great one, save only with the king of Israel alone.
011	1KI	022	032	And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely this is the king of Israel. And they turned aside against him to fight: and Jehoshaphat cried out.
011	1KI	022	033	And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from following him.
011	1KI	022	034	But a man drew his bow at a venture, and struck the king of Israel between the joints and the armor; wherefore he said unto his chariot-driver. Turn about, and carry me out of the camp; for I am wounded.
011	1KI	022	035	And the battle increased on that day; and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians; but he died in the evening: and the blood of the wound flowed down into the hollow of the chariot.
011	1KI	022	036	And there went a proclamation throughout the camp at the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own land.
011	1KI	022	037	So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.
011	1KI	022	038	And the chariot was washed out at the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood, as they washed his armor: according to the word of the Lord which he had spoken.
011	1KI	022	039	Now the rest of the acts of Achab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities that he built, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
011	1KI	022	040	So Achab slept with his fathers: and Achazyahu his son became king in his stead.
011	1KI	022	041	And Jehoshaphat the son of Assa became king over Judah in the fourth year of Achab the king of Israel.
011	1KI	022	042	Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he became king, and twenty and five years did he reign in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was 'Azubah the daughter of Shilchi.
011	1KI	022	043	And he walked in all the ways of Assa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing what is right in the eyes of the Lord: Nevertheless the high-places were not removed; for the people still offered, and burnt incense on the high-places.
011	1KI	022	044	And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.
011	1KI	022	045	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his mighty deeds that he showed, and how he warred, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah.
011	1KI	022	046	And the remnant of the sodomites, that had been left in the days of his father Assa, did he put away out of the land.
011	1KI	022	047	There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king.
011	1KI	022	048	Jehoshaphat made Tharshish-ships to go to Ophir for gold; but they went not; for the ships were wrecked at 'Ezyon-geber.
011	1KI	022	049	Then said Achazyahu the son of Achab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.
011	1KI	022	050	And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son became king in his stead.
011	1KI	022	051	Achazyahu the son of Achab became king over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah; and he reigned over Israel two years.
011	1KI	022	052	And he did what is evil in the eyes of the Lord, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jerobo'am the son of Nebat, who had induced Israel to sin.
011	1KI	022	053	And he served Ba'al, and bowed down to him, and he provoked to anger the Lord the God of Israel, all just as his father had done.

012	2KI	001	001	Then did Moab rebel against Israel after the death of Achab.
012	2KI	001	002	And Achazyah fell down through the lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and became sick; and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, inquire of Ba'al-zebub the god of 'Ekron whether I shall recover from this sickness.
012	2KI	001	003	But an angel of the Lord spoke to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, Is it because there is not a God in Israel, that ye go to inquire of Ba'al-zebub the god of 'Ekron?
012	2KI	001	004	Now therefore, thus hath said the Lord, From the bed on which thou art gone up shalt thou not come down; for thou shalt surely die. And Elijah departed.
012	2KI	001	005	And the messengers returned unto him, and he said unto them, Why is this that ye are already returned?
012	2KI	001	006	And they said unto him, There came up a man to meet us, and he said unto us, Go, return unto the king that hath sent you, and speak unto him, Thus hath said the Lord, Is it because there is not a God in Israel, that thou sendest to inquire of Ba'al-zebub the god of 'Ekron? therefore from the bed on which thou art gone up shalt thou not come down; for thou shalt surely die.
012	2KI	001	007	And he spoke unto them, What is the manner of the man who came up to meet you, and spoke unto you these words?
012	2KI	001	008	And they said unto him, He is a hairy man, with a girdle of leather girded about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.
012	2KI	001	009	Then did he send unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty: and he went up to him, and, behold, he was sitting on the top of the mount; and he spoke unto him, O man of God, the king hath commanded, Come down.
012	2KI	001	010	And Elijah answered and spoke to the captain of the fifty, And if I be a man of God, let a fire come down from heaven and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down a fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.
012	2KI	001	011	And he sent again unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he commenced and spoke unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly.
012	2KI	001	012	And Elijah answered and spoke unto them, If I be a man of God, let a fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.
012	2KI	001	013	And he sent again a captain of fifty the third time with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and bent down on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and spoke unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life and the life of these fifty thy servants be precious in thy eyes.
012	2KI	001	014	Behold, there came down a fire from heaven, and consumed the two captains of the first fifties with their fifties; and now let my life be precious in thy eyes.
012	2KI	001	015	And the angel of the Lord spoke unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him, and he arose, and went down with him unto the king.
012	2KI	001	016	And he spoke unto him, Thus hath said the Lord, Forasmuch as thou didst send messengers to inquire of Ba'al-zebub the God of 'Ekron, as though there were no God in Israel to inquire of his word: therefore from the bed on which thou art gone up shalt thou not come down; for thou shalt surely die.
012	2KI	001	017	And he died, according to the word of the Lord which Elijah had spoken; and Jehoram became king in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah; because he had no son.
012	2KI	001	018	Now the rest of the acts of Achazyahu which he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
012	2KI	002	001	And it came to pass, when the Lord was about to take up Elijah by a storm-wind to heaven, that Elijah went out with Elisha' from Gilgal.
012	2KI	002	002	And Elijah said unto Elisha', Remain, I pray thee, here; for the Lord hath sent me as far as Beth-el. But Elisha' said, As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Beth-el.
012	2KI	002	003	And the sons of the prophets that were at Beth-el came forth to Elisha', and said unto him, Knowest thou that today the Lord will take away thy master from thy head? And he said, I also know it; be still.
012	2KI	002	004	And Elijah said unto him, Elisha', remain, I pray thee, here; for the Lord hath sent me to Jericho. But he said, As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.
012	2KI	002	005	And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came near to Elisha', and said unto him, Knowest thou that today the Lord will take away thy master from thy head? And he said, I also know it; be still.
012	2KI	002	006	And Elijah said unto him, Remain, I pray thee, here; for the Lord hath sent me to the Jordan. But he said, As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So these two went on.
012	2KI	002	007	And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood opposite [to them] afar off: and those two stood by the Jordan.
012	2KI	002	008	And Elijah took his mantle, and folded it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, and they went, both of them, over on dry ground.
012	2KI	002	009	And it came to pass, when they passed over, that Elijah said unto Elisha', Ask what I shall do for thee, before I shall be taken away from thee. And Elisha' said, Let there be, I pray thee, a double portion of thy spirit upon me.
012	2KI	002	010	And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so [given] unto thee; but if not, it shall not be.
012	2KI	002	011	And it came to pass, as they went on, speaking as they were going, that, behold, there came a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a storm-wind to heaven.
012	2KI	002	012	And Elisha' saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and their horsemen. And he saw him no more; and he took hold of his clothes, and rent them in two pieces.
012	2KI	002	013	And he lifted up the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and went back, and stood by the border of the Jordan;
012	2KI	002	014	And he took the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the Lord the God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither; and Elisha' passed over.
012	2KI	002	015	And when the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho, at a distance, saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah Doth rest on Elisha'. And they came forth to meet him, and bowed themselves unto him to the ground.
012	2KI	002	016	And they said unto him, Behold now, there are among thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master; peradventure the Spirit of the Lord hath taken him up, and cast him upon one of the mountains, or into one of the valleys. And he said, Ye must not send.
012	2KI	002	017	And they urged him till he was ashamed, when he said, Send. And they sent fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.
012	2KI	002	018	And they returned again to him, for he had remained at Jericho; and he then said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Ye should not go?
012	2KI	002	019	And the men of the city said unto Elisha', Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city is good, as my Lord seeth; but the water is bad, and the land causeth untimely births.
012	2KI	002	020	And he said, Fetch me a new flask, and put salt therein: and they fetched it to him.
012	2KI	002	021	And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast therein the salt, and said, Thus hath said the Lord, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from there any more death or untimely births.
012	2KI	002	022	So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the word of Elisha' which he spoke.
012	2KI	002	023	And he went up from there to Beth-el: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth young lads out of the city, and they mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, bald-head! go up, bald-head!
012	2KI	002	024	And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the Lord; and there came forth two she-bears out of the forest, and tore of them forty and two boys.
012	2KI	002	025	And he went from there to mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.
012	2KI	003	001	And Jehoram the son of Achab became king over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, and he reigned twelve years.
012	2KI	003	002	And he did what is evil in the eyes of the Lord; but not like his father, and like his mother; and he removed the statue of Ba'al which his father had made.
012	2KI	003	003	Nevertheless unto the sins of Jerobo'am the son of Nebat, who had induced Israel to sin, did he cleave: he departed not therefrom.
012	2KI	003	004	And Mesha' the king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered as tribute unto the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs, and a hundred thousand rams, with the wool.
012	2KI	003	005	And it came to pass, when Achab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
012	2KI	003	006	And king Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time, and numbered all Israel.
012	2KI	003	007	And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up, I as thyself, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.
012	2KI	003	008	And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he said, The way through the wilderness of Edom.
012	2KI	003	009	So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they took a circuitous route, a seven days' journey; and there was no water for the camp, and for the cattle that followed in their train.
012	2KI	003	010	And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the Lord hath called these three kings, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!
012	2KI	003	011	But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the Lord, that we may inquire of the Lord from him? And there answered one of the king of Israel's servants and said, Here is Elisha' the son of Shaphat, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.
012	2KI	003	012	And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the Lord is with him. And there went down to him the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom.
012	2KI	003	013	And Elisha' said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? go to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Not so; for the Lord hath called these three kings, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.
012	2KI	003	014	And Elisha' said, As the Lord of hosts liveth, before whom I have stood, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee.
012	2KI	003	015	But now bring me a musician. And it came to pass, when the musician played, that the inspiration of the Lord came upon him.
012	2KI	003	016	And he said, Thus hath said the Lord, Make this valley full of ditches.
012	2KI	003	017	For thus hath said the Lord, Ye shall not perceive wind, nor shall ye see rain; yet this valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drink, yourselves, and your flocks, and your cattle.
012	2KI	003	018	And this is yet too light a thing in the eyes of the Lord; and he will also deliver the Moabites into your hand.
012	2KI	003	019	And ye shall smite every fortified city, and every choice city, and every good tree shall ye fell, and all springs of water shall ye stop, and every good piece of land shall ye spoil with stones.
012	2KI	003	020	And it came to pass in the morning, at the time when the meat-offering is offered, that, behold, there came water by the way from Edom, and the country was filled with the water.
012	2KI	003	021	And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they were called together from every one who was girded with a sword, and upward, and they posted themselves on the border.
012	2KI	003	022	And when they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, the Moabites saw the water at a distance as red as blood.
012	2KI	003	023	And they said, This is blood; the kings have certainly had a contest among themselves, and they have smitten one another: and now, up to the spoil, Moab.
012	2KI	003	024	But when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they smote the Moabites completely, even in their own country.
012	2KI	003	025	And the cities they pulled down, and into every good piece of land they cast every man his stone, and filled it up, and every spring of water they stopped, and every good tree they felled, until they left only its stones in Kir-chareseth, and this the slingers encompassed and smote it.
012	2KI	003	026	And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too strong for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew the sword, to break through unto the king of Edom; but they could not.
012	2KI	003	027	Then took he his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt-offering upon the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their land.
012	2KI	004	001	And a certain woman, of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried unto Elisha', saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou well knowest that thy servant was one who feared the Lord: and now the creditor is come to take my two sons unto himself for servants.
012	2KI	004	002	And Elisha' said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thy hand-maid hath nothing in the house, save a pot of oil.
012	2KI	004	003	And he said, Go, borrow for thyself vessels from abroad from all thy neighbors, empty vessels, let them not be a few.
012	2KI	004	004	And then go home, and lock the door behind thee and behind thy sons, and then pour out into all those vessels; and that which is full thou shalt set aside.
012	2KI	004	005	So she went from him, and locked the door behind her and behind her sons, who brought the vessels near to her, and she poured out.
012	2KI	004	006	And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring near to me yet another vessel; and he said unto her, There is not a vessel more: and the oil stayed.
012	2KI	004	007	Then came she and told it to the man of God; and he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and thou with thy children shalt live of the rest.
012	2KI	004	008	And it happened one day, that Elisha' passed over to Shunem, and there was a great woman, and she constrained him to eat bread; and it happened, that as oft as he passed by, he used to turn in thither to eat bread.
012	2KI	004	009	And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, who passeth through by us continually.
012	2KI	004	010	Let us then make a little upper chamber, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a chair, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.
012	2KI	004	011	And it happened one day, that he came thither, and he turned into the upper chamber, and lay there.
012	2KI	004	012	And he said to Gechazi his servant, Call this Shunammite: and he called her, and she stood before him.
012	2KI	004	013	And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been at pains to take all this trouble for us: what is to be done for thee? wouldst thou be spoken for to the king, or to the chief of the army? And she said, I dwell in the midst of my own people.
012	2KI	004	014	And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gechazi said, Verily, she hath no son, and her husband is old.
012	2KI	004	015	And he said, Call her: and he called her, and she stood in the door.
012	2KI	004	016	And he said, At this season, next year, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, No, my Lord, man of God, do not deceive thy hand-maid.
012	2KI	004	017	But the woman conceived, and bore a son at that season in the following year, as Elisha' had spoken unto her.
012	2KI	004	018	And the child grew up; and it happened one day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.
012	2KI	004	019	And he said unto his father, My head, my head: and he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother.
012	2KI	004	020	And he took him up, and brought him to his mother, and he sat on her knees till noon, when he died.
012	2KI	004	021	And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and locked the door behind him, and went out.
012	2KI	004	022	And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men, and one of the she-asses, that I may hasten as far as the man of God, and return.
012	2KI	004	023	And he said, Wherefore art thou going to him today? it is neither new moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It is well.
012	2KI	004	024	Then she saddled the she-ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; do not restrain me in riding, unless I say it to thee.
012	2KI	004	025	So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel; and it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gechazi his servant, Behold, yonder that Shunammite.
012	2KI	004	026	Now do run to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with thy child? and she answered, It is well.
012	2KI	004	027	And she came to the man of God to the mount, and caught hold of his feet; and Gechazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is grieved within her; and the Lord hath hidden it from me, and hath not told it me.
012	2KI	004	028	And she said, Did I request a son from my Lord? did I not say, Do not lead me astray?
012	2KI	004	029	Then said he to Gechazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thy hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, thou shalt not salute him; and if any salute thee, thou shalt not answer him; and lay my staff upon the face of the lad.
012	2KI	004	030	And the mother of the lad said, As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose and followed her.
012	2KI	004	031	And Gechazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the lad; but there was neither voice, nor perceptible sound; wherefore he went back to meet him, and told him, saying, The lad is not awakened.
012	2KI	004	032	And when Elisha' was come into the house, behold, the lad was dead, laid upon his bed.
012	2KI	004	033	And he went in and locked the door behind both of them, and prayed unto the Lord.
012	2KI	004	034	And he went up, and laid himself upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands; and he stretched himself upon him: and the flesh of the child became warm.
012	2KI	004	035	Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself [again] upon him; and the lad sneezed as many as seven times, and the lad opened his eyes.
012	2KI	004	036	And he called Gechazi, and said, Call this Shunammite: so he called her, and she came in unto him; and he said, Take up thy son.
012	2KI	004	037	Then went she in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son, and went out.
012	2KI	004	038	And Elisha' returned to Gilgal; and there was a famine in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him: and he said unto his servant, Set on the large pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets.
012	2KI	004	039	And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild colocynths his garment full, and came and cut them up into the pot of pottage; for they knew them not.
012	2KI	004	040	And they poured it out for the men to eat; and it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, Death is in the pot, O man of God. And they could not eat.
012	2KI	004	041	But he said, Then bring some meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour it out for the people, that they may eat. And there was nothing bad in the pot.
012	2KI	004	042	And there came a man from Ba'alshalishah, and brought unto the man of God bread of the first-fruits, twenty loaves of barley bread, and fresh ears of corn in his scrip: and he said, Give it unto the people, that they may eat.
012	2KI	004	043	And his servitor said, What, shall I set this before a hundred men? And he said, Give it unto the people, that they may eat; for thus hath said the Lord, They shall eat, and shall leave [thereof].
012	2KI	004	044	So he set it before them, and they ate, and left thereof, according to the word of the Lord.
012	2KI	005	001	And Na'aman, the captain of the army of the king of Syria, was a great man before his Lord, and highly honored; because by him had the Lord given victory unto Syria: and this man was valiant in war, [but] a leper.
012	2KI	005	002	And the Syrians had gone out in predatory troops, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maiden; and she waited on Na'aman's wife.
012	2KI	005	003	And she said unto her mistress, Oh that my Lord were but before the prophet that is in Samaria! then would he heal him of his leprosy.
012	2KI	005	004	And he went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus hath spoken the maiden that is from the land of Israel.
012	2KI	005	005	And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of garments.
012	2KI	005	006	And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, which said, And now when this letter cometh unto thee, behold, I have sent to thee Na'aman my servant, that thou mayest heal him of his leprosy.
012	2KI	005	007	And it came to pass, when the king of Israel read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this one doth send unto me to heal a man of his leprosy? for know to a certainty, I pray you, and see that he but seeketh a quarrel against me.
012	2KI	005	008	And it happened, when Elisha' the man of God heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him but come to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.
012	2KI	005	009	And Na'aman came with his horses and with his chariot, and remained at the door of the house of Elisha'.
012	2KI	005	010	And Elisha' sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and bathe seven times in the Jordan, and thy flesh shall be restored [healthy] to thee, and thou shalt become clean.
012	2KI	005	011	But Na'aman became wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I had thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the Lord his God, and swing his hand over the place, and heal the leper.
012	2KI	005	012	Are not Amanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not bathe in them, and become clean? and he turned and went away in a rage.
012	2KI	005	013	And his servants came near, and spoke unto him, and they said, My father, if the prophet had bidden thee a great thing, wouldst thou not do it? how much rather then, when he hath said to thee, Bathe, and become clean?
012	2KI	005	014	Then went he down, and dived seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of the man of God: and his flesh was restored [healthy] like the flesh of a little boy, and he became clean.
012	2KI	005	015	And he returned to the man of God, he with all his camp, and came and stood before him, and said, Behold, now I know that there is no god on all the earth, but in Israel; and now, I pray thee, take a present from thy servant.
012	2KI	005	016	But he said, As the Lord liveth before whom I have stood, I will take none: and he urged him to take it; but he refused.
012	2KI	005	017	And Na'aman said, If [thou wilt] not, [then] let there be given, I pray thee, unto thy servant two mules' burden of earth; for thy servant will not offer henceforth either burnt-offering or peace-sacrifice unto other gods, except unto the Lord.
012	2KI	005	018	For this thing may the Lord pardon thy servant, that when my Lord goeth into the house of Rimmon to prostrate himself there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I prostrate myself also in the house of Rimmon: when I prostrate myself in the house of Rimmon, may the Lord pardon thy servant for this thing.
012	2KI	005	019	And he said unto him, Go in peace: so he departed from him some distance.
012	2KI	005	020	But Gechazi, the servant of Elisha' the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared Na'aman, this Syrian, in not receiving from his hand what he had brought; but, as the Lord liveth, I will run after him, and take some little thing from him.
012	2KI	005	021	So Gechazi hurried after Na'aman; and when Na'aman saw him running after him, he lighted doom from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is [all] well?
012	2KI	005	022	And he said, [all] is well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there are come to me from the mountain of Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets: do give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments.
012	2KI	005	023	And Na'aman said, Give thy assent, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound up two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and he gave them unto his two young men, and they carried them before him.
012	2KI	005	024	And when he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house: and he dismissed the men, and they departed.
012	2KI	005	025	But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha' said unto him, Whence comest thou, Gechazi? And he said, Thy servant went not hither or thither.
012	2KI	005	026	And he said unto him, My mind was not gone, when the man turned round from his chariot to meet thee. Is it a time to take money, and to take garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and men-servants, and maid-servants?
012	2KI	005	027	May then the leprosy of Na'aman cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper [as white] as snow.
012	2KI	006	001	And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha', Behold now, the place where we dwell before thee is too narrow for us.
012	2KI	006	002	Let us go, we pray thee, as far as the Jordan, and take thence every man one beam, and let us prepare for us there a place to dwell therein. And he said, Go.
012	2KI	006	003	And one said, Give thy assent, I pray thee, and go with thy servants. And he said, I will indeed go.
012	2KI	006	004	So he went with them; and they came to the Jordan, and they cut down trees.
012	2KI	006	005	But as one was felling a beam, the axe-head fell into the water: and he cried, and said, Alas, my Lord! it was also borrowed.
012	2KI	006	006	And the man of God said, Where did it fall? And he showed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither, and he caused the iron to swim.
012	2KI	006	007	And then said he, Lift it up to thee. And he stretched out his hand, and took it.
012	2KI	006	008	And the king of Syria made war against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp.
012	2KI	006	009	And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not that place; for thither the Syrians are come down.
012	2KI	006	010	And the king of Israel sent to the place, which the man of God had told him and warned him of, and he took care of himself there: not once nor twice.
012	2KI	006	011	Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sorely troubled concerning this thing; and he called for his servants, and said unto them, Can ye not tell me who of us is for the king of Israel?
012	2KI	006	012	And one of his servants said, Not so, my Lord, O king; but Elisha', the prophet that is in Israel, can tell unto the king of Israel the words that thou mayest speak in thy sleeping-chamber.
012	2KI	006	013	And he said, Go and see where he is, that I may send and fetch him. And it was told unto him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.
012	2KI	006	014	And he sent thither horses, and chariots, and a strong army: and they came by night, and surrounded the city.
012	2KI	006	015	And the servant of the man of God rose early, and went forth, when, behold, an army compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?
012	2KI	006	016	And he said, Fear not: for those that are with us are more than those that are with them.
012	2KI	006	017	And Elisha' prayed, and said, O Lord, open, I pray thee, his eyes, that he may see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man: and he saw, and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha'.
012	2KI	006	018	And when they came down to him, Elisha' prayed unto the Lord, and said, Smite, I pray thee, this people with blindness. And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha'.
012	2KI	006	019	And Elisha' said unto them, This is not the way, neither is this the city: follow me, and I will lead you to the man whom ye wish to seek. And he led them thus to Samaria.
012	2KI	006	020	And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha' said, Lord, open the eyes of these, that they may see. And the Lord opened their eyes, and they saw, and, behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.
012	2KI	006	021	And the king of Israel said unto Elisha', when he saw them, Shall I smite them? Shall I smite them, my father?
012	2KI	006	022	But he said, Thou shalt not smite them: wouldst thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go [back] to their master.
012	2KI	006	023	And he prepared for them a great meal; and they ate and drank, and he sent them away, and they went [back] to their master. And the predatory bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.
012	2KI	006	024	And it came to pass after this, that Ben-hadad the king of Syria assembled all his camp, and went up, and besieged Samaria.
012	2KI	006	025	And there was a great famine in Samaria; and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was sold for eighty pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a kab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver.
012	2KI	006	026	And it happened as the king of Israel was passing along upon the wall, that a woman cried unto him, saying, Help, my Lord, O king.
012	2KI	006	027	And he said, If the Lord do not help thee, whence shall I help thee? shall it be out of the threshing-floor, or out of the wine-press?
012	2KI	006	028	And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she said, This woman said unto me, Give up thy son, that we may eat him today, and my son we will eat tomorrow.
012	2KI	006	029	So we boiled my son, and ate him; but when I said unto her on the next day, Give up thy son, that we may eat him: she hid her son.
012	2KI	006	030	And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes, as he was passing along upon the wall: and the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth beneath upon his flesh.
012	2KI	006	031	Then said he, May God do so unto me and continue so yet farther, if the head of Elisha' the son of Shaphat shall remain on him this day.
012	2KI	006	032	But Elisha' was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him; and he sent a man from before him; but before the messenger could yet come to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of the murderer hath sent to remove my head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him back with the door: is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?
012	2KI	006	033	And while he was yet speaking with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of the Lord; what shall I hope for in the Lord any longer?
012	2KI	007	001	Then said Elisha', Hear ye the word of the Lord: Thus hath said the Lord, About this time tomorrow a seah of fine flour shall be sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.
012	2KI	007	002	Then answered the lord of the king, on whose hand he used to lean, the man of God, and said, Behold, will the Lord make windows in the heavens, that this thing shall be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thy eyes, but thereof shalt thou not eat.
012	2KI	007	003	And there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate: and they said one to another, Why do we remain here until we die?
012	2KI	007	004	If we say, We will enter into the city, then is the famine in the city, and we shall die there; and if we remain here, we die [also]: now therefore come, and let us go over unto the camp of the Syrians; if they will let us live, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.
012	2KI	007	005	And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians; and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of the Syrians, behold, there was no man there.
012	2KI	007	006	For the Lord had caused the camp of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, the noise of a large army: and they said one to the other, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.
012	2KI	007	007	And they were arisen and fled in the twilight, and had left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, the camp as it was, and fled for their life.
012	2KI	007	008	And so came these lepers to the uttermost part of the camp, and they went into one tent, and ate and drank, and carried away thence silver, and gold, and garments, and went and hid them; and they returned, and entered into another tent, and carried away [something] thence, and went and hid it.
012	2KI	007	009	And then they said one to the other, We do not act correctly; this day is a day of good tidings; and if we remain silent, and tarry till the morning-light, we shall incur guilt: now then come, and let us go and tell it at the king's house.
012	2KI	007	010	So they went and called unto one of the gate-keepers of the city, and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, nor the voice of man; but the horses were tied, and the asses were tied, and the tents as they had been.
012	2KI	007	011	And he called the gate-keepers; and they told it at the king's house within.
012	2KI	007	012	And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I can easily tell you what the Syrians have done to us: they know that we are hungry; and they are therefore gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, If they should come out of the city, we will catch them alive, and enter into the city.
012	2KI	007	013	And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city, let it fare with them as with all the multitude of Israel that are left in it, [or] let it fare with them as with all the multitude of Israel that have perished: and let us send out and see.
012	2KI	007	014	And they took two chariots with horses; and the king sent after the camp of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.
012	2KI	007	015	And they went after them as far as the Jordan; and, lo, the whole way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste: and the messengers returned, and told it to the king.
012	2KI	007	016	And the people went out, and plundered the camp of the Syrians: and a seah of fine flour was to be had for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the Lord.
012	2KI	007	017	And the king had appointed the lord on whose hand he used to lean to have the charge of the gate; and the people trod him down in the gate, and he died; as the man of God had spoken, which he spoke when the king came down to him.
012	2KI	007	018	And it came to pass as the man of God was speaking to the king, saying, Two seahs of barley for a shekel, and a seah of fine flour for a shekel, shall be about this time tomorrow in the gate of Samaria:
012	2KI	007	019	That the Lord had answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, if even the Lord were to make windows in the heavens, would such a thing be? And he had said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thy eyes, but thereof shalt thou not eat.
012	2KI	007	020	And it happened unto him so; for the people trod him down in the gate, and he died.
012	2KI	008	001	And Elisha' spoke unto the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go, thou and thy household, and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn; for the Lord hath called for a famine, and it is also coming in the land for seven years.
012	2KI	008	002	And the woman arose, and did after the word of the man of God; and she went, she with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.
012	2KI	008	003	And it came to pass at the end of seven years, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines; and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land.
012	2KI	008	004	And the king was just speaking with Gechazi the servant of the man of God, saying, Relate to me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha' hath done.
012	2KI	008	005	And it came to pass, as he was just relating to the king how he had restored the dead to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gechazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha' restored to life.
012	2KI	008	006	And the king asked of the woman, who related it to him. So the king appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that belongeth to her, and all the products of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now.
012	2KI	008	007	And Elisha' came to Damascus; and Ben-hadad, the king of Syria, was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come even hither.
012	2KI	008	008	And the king said unto Chazael, Take a present in thy hand, and go to meet the man of God, and inquire of the Lord from him, saying, Shall I recover from this sickness?
012	2KI	008	009	So Chazael went to meet him, and took a present in his hand, and all manner of good things of Damascus, a burden for forty camels, and he came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Ben-hadad the king of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover from this sickness?
012	2KI	008	010	And Elisha' said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest certainly recover; nevertheless the Lord hath shown me that he shall surely die.
012	2KI	008	011	And he restrained his countenance, and held back as long as he could: and then wept the man of God.
012	2KI	008	012	And Chazael said, Why doth my Lord weep? And he said, Because I know what evil thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their strong-holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and their children wilt thou dash, and their pregnant women wilt thou rip up.
012	2KI	008	013	And Chazael said, But what is thy servant, the dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha' said, The Lord hath caused me to see thee as king over Syria.
012	2KI	008	014	So he went away from Elisha', and came to his master; who said to him, What hath Elisha' said to thee? And he said, he said to me that thou couldst surely recover.
012	2KI	008	015	And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a cover lid, and dipped it in water, and spread it over his face, and he died: and Chazael became king in his stead.
012	2KI	008	016	And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Achab the king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being yet king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah became king.
012	2KI	008	017	Thirty and two years old was he when he became king, and eight years did he reign in Jerusalem.
012	2KI	008	018	And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as the house of Achab had done; for a daughter of Achab had he for wife: and he did what is evil in the eyes of the Lord.
012	2KI	008	019	Yet would the Lord not destroy Judah for the sake of David his servant, as he said unto him, to give him a government and to his children at all times.
012	2KI	008	020	In his days Edom revolted from under the power of Judah, and they appointed a king over themselves.
012	2KI	008	021	And Joram went over to Za'ir, and all the chariots were with him; and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites who compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled unto their tents.
012	2KI	008	022	Yet Edom revolted from under the power of Judah even until this day; then did Libnah revolt at the same time.
012	2KI	008	023	And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah.
012	2KI	008	024	And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Achazyahu his son became king in his stead.
012	2KI	008	025	In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Achab the king of Israel became Achazyahu, the son of Jehoram the king of Judah, king.
012	2KI	008	026	Two and twenty years old was Achazyahu when he became king; and one year did he reign in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was 'Athalyahu, the [grand-]daughter of 'Omri the king of Israel.
012	2KI	008	027	And he walked in the way of the house of Achab, and did what is evil in the eyes of the Lord, like the house of Achab; for he was the son-in-law of the house of Achab.
012	2KI	008	028	And he went with Joram the son of Achab to the war against Chazael the king of Syria at Ramoth-gil'ad: and the Syrians smote Joram.
012	2KI	008	029	And king Joram returned to be healed in Yizre'el of the wounds which the Syrians had inflicted on him at Ramah, when he was fighting against Chazael the king of Syria. And Achazyahu the son of Jehoram the king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Achab in Yizre'el, because he was sick.
012	2KI	009	001	And Elisha' the prophet called one of the children of the prophets, and said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this flask of oil in thy hand, and go to Ramoth-gil'ad:
012	2KI	009	002	And when thou art come thither, look out there for Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and cause him to stand up from the midst of his brethren, and bring him in to the innermost chamber;
012	2KI	009	003	And thou shalt then take the flask of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus hath said the Lord, I have anointed thee as king over Israel. Then must thou open the door, and flee, and not wait for any thing.
012	2KI	009	004	So the young man, the disciple of the prophet, went to Ramoth-gil'ad.
012	2KI	009	005	And when he came, behold, the captains of the army were sitting; and he said, I have a word for thee, O captain. And Jehu said, For whom of all of us? And he said, For thee, O captain.
012	2KI	009	006	And he arose, and went into the house: and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus hath said the Lord the God of Israel, I anoint thee as king over the people of the Lord, over Israel.
012	2KI	009	007	And thou shalt smite the house of Achab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the Lord, at the hand of Izebel.
012	2KI	009	008	And the whole house of Achab shall perish: and I will cut off from Achab every male, and the guarded and fortified in Israel;
012	2KI	009	009	And I will make the house of Achab like the house of Jerobo'am the son of Nebat, and like the house of Ba'sha the son of Achiyah;
012	2KI	009	010	And Izebel shall the dogs eat in the field of Yizre'el, with none to bury her. And he [then] opened the door, and fled.
012	2KI	009	011	But Jehu came forth to the servants of his Lord: and one said unto him, Is all well? wherefore came this madman to thee? And he said unto them, Ye yourselves know the man, and his talk.
012	2KI	009	012	And they said, It is false: only tell us, we pray thee. And he said, So and so did he speak to me, saying, Thus hath said the Lord, I anoint thee as king over Israel.
012	2KI	009	013	Then they hastened, and they took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs; and they blew the cornet, saying, Jehu is king.
012	2KI	009	014	So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram had kept guard at Ramoth-gil'ad, he and all Israel, because of Chazael the king of Syria.
012	2KI	009	015	But king Jehoram was returned to be healed in Yizre'el of the wounds which the Syrians had inflicted on him, when he was fighting with Chazael the king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If this be your mind, then let none that escapeth go forth out of the city to go to tell it in Yizre'el.
012	2KI	009	016	So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Yizre'el; for Joram was lying there. And Achazyah the king of Judah was come down to see Joram.
012	2KI	009	017	And the watchman stood on the tower in Yizre'el, and he saw the company of Jehu as he came; and he said, A company do I see, And Jehoram said, Take a horseman, and send out to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?
012	2KI	009	018	So there went one riding on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus hath said the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee about behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came up to them, but he hath not returned.
012	2KI	009	019	Then sent he out a second rider on horseback, who came to them, and said, Thus hath said the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee about behind me.
012	2KI	009	020	And the watchman told, saying, He came up to them, but he hath not returned: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth as though he were mad.
012	2KI	009	021	And Jehoram said, Harness up. And his chariot was harnessed up. And Jehoram the king of Israel and Achazyahu the king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out to meet Jehu, and found him in the portion of land of Naboth the Yizre'elite.
012	2KI	009	022	And it came to pass, when Jehoram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he said, What peace can there be with the acts of incest of thy mother Izebel and her many witchcrafts?
012	2KI	009	023	And Jehoram turned about, and fled, and said to Achazyahu, Treachery, Achazyahu.
012	2KI	009	024	And Jehu grasped the bow with his full strength, and struck Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.
012	2KI	009	025	Then said he to Bidkar his officer, Lift up, [and] cast him down in the part of the field that was Naboth's the Yizre'elite; for remember how that I and thou rode alongside each other after Achab his father, when the Lord pronounced over him this fatal decree:
012	2KI	009	026	Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith the Lord; and I will repay thee in this part of the field, saith the Lord. And now lift up, [and] cast him down into the field, according to the word of the Lord.
012	2KI	009	027	And when Achazyahu the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden-house; but Jehu pursued after him, and said, Also him smite in the chariot. [And they did so] on the ascent to Gur, which is by Yible'am. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.
012	2KI	009	028	And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David.
012	2KI	009	029	And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Achab became Achazyah king over Judah.
012	2KI	009	030	And Jehu came to Yizre'el; and when Izebel heard of it, she painted her eyes, and ornamented her head, and looked out at the window.
012	2KI	009	031	And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Is it peace, O Zimri, who hath slain his master?
012	2KI	009	032	And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side? who? And there looked out to him two or three chamberlains.
012	2KI	009	033	And he said, Pitch her down. So they pitched her down: and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses; and he trod her under foot.
012	2KI	009	034	And he came in, and ate and drank; and then said he, Look, I pray you, after this accursed one, and bury her; for she is a king's daughter.
012	2KI	009	035	And they went to bury her: but they found nothing of her but the skull, and the feet, and the palms of the hands.
012	2KI	009	036	And they returned, and told him; and he said, It is the word of the Lord, which he spoke by means of his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the field of Yizre'el shall the dogs eat the flesh of Izebel:
012	2KI	009	037	And the carcass of Izebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Yizre'el; so that they shall not say, This is Izebel.
012	2KI	010	001	And Achab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria, unto the rulers of Yizre'el, the elders, and to those that brought up Achab's children, saying,
012	2KI	010	002	And now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing that there are with you your master's sons, and there are with you the chariots and the horses, and the fortified city, and the armor:
012	2KI	010	003	Select then the best and the most fitting of your master's sons, and set him on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house.
012	2KI	010	004	But they were exceedingly much afraid, and said, Behold, the two kings could not stand before him: how then shall we be able to stand?
012	2KI	010	005	And the superintendent over the house, and the commander over the city, and the elders, and the bringers up of the children, sent to Jehu, saying, We are thy servants, and all that thou mayest say unto us will we do; we will not set up any one as king: do what is good in thy eyes.
012	2KI	010	006	Then wrote he to them a letter the second time, saying, If ye be for me, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, then take the heads of the men, your master's sons, and come to me to Yizre'el by this time tomorrow. Now the king's sons, seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, who brought them up.
012	2KI	010	007	And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons and slaughtered them, seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to him to Yizre'el.
012	2KI	010	008	And the messenger came, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Place ye them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning.
012	2KI	010	009	And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye are righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him; but who hath killed all these?
012	2KI	010	010	Know now that there shall not fall of the word of the Lord unto the earth, the least that the Lord hath spoken concerning the house of Achab; and the Lord hath done that which he spoke by means of his servant Elijah.
012	2KI	010	011	And Jehu smote all that yet remained of the house of Achab in Yizre'el, and all his great men, and his acquaintance, and his priests, until he had left him none that escaped.
012	2KI	010	012	And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria; he was just at the binding-house of the shepherds, on the way:
012	2KI	010	013	When Jehu met with the brothers of Achazyahu the king of Judah, and he said, Who are ye? And they said, The brothers of Achazyahu are we; and we are come down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen.
012	2KI	010	014	And he said, Seize them alive. And they seized them alive, and slaughtered them at the pit of the binding-house, two and forty men; and he left not one of them remaining.
012	2KI	010	015	And he went away thence, and met Yehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is all right in thy heart, as my heart is with thy heart? And Yehonadab answered, It is; it is: give me thy hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.
012	2KI	010	016	And he said, Come with me, and behold my zeal for the Lord. So they made him ride in his chariot.
012	2KI	010	017	And when he came to Samaria, he smote all that yet remained unto Achab in Samaria, till he had exterminated him, according to the word of the Lord which he had spoken to Elijah.
012	2KI	010	018	And Jehu assembled all the people, and said unto them, Achab hath served Ba'al a little: Jehu will serve him much.
012	2KI	010	019	And now call unto me all the prophets of Ba'al, all his worshippers, and all his priests: let no one be missing; for I have a great sacrifice to make for Ba'al; whosoever will be missing, shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtilty, in order to destroy the worshippers of Ba'al.
012	2KI	010	020	And Jehu said, Sanctify a solemn assembly for Ba'al. And they proclaimed it.
012	2KI	010	021	And Jehu sent throughout all Israel: and there came all the worshippers of Ba'al, so that there was not a man remaining that came not; and they came into the house of Ba'al; and the house of Ba'al was full from one end to another.
012	2KI	010	022	And he said unto him that was over the wardrobe, Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Ba'al. And he brought forth for them the vestments.
012	2KI	010	023	And Jehu went, with Yehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Ba'al, and he said unto the worshippers of Ba'al, Search, and look that there be not here with you any of the servants of the Lord, but the worshippers of Ba'al entirely alone.
012	2KI	010	024	And they went in to prepare sacrifices and burnt-offerings; but Jehu had set for himself without eighty men, and said, [If there be] a man that escapeth from the men whom I deliver into your hands, [there shall be given] life for his life.
012	2KI	010	025	And it came to pass, as soon as they had made an end of preparing the burnt-offering, that Jehu said to the runners and to the officers, Go in, smite them: let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the runners and the captains cast them out, and went as far as the city of the house of Ba'al.
012	2KI	010	026	And they brought forth the statues out of the house of Ba'al, and burnt every one of them.
012	2KI	010	027	And they broke down the statue of Ba'al, and broke down the house of Ba'al, and made it a common sewer unto this day.
012	2KI	010	028	Thus Jehu exterminated Ba'al out of Israel.
012	2KI	010	029	Nevertheless the sins of Jerobo'am the son of Nebat, who induced Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from in following them, [namely,] the golden calves that were in Beth-el, and that were in Dan.
012	2KI	010	030	And the Lord said unto Jehu, Forasmuch as thou hast acted well in doing what is right in my eyes, and hast done in accordance with all that was in my heart unto the house of Achab: children of the fourth generation after thee shall sit upon the throne of Israel.
012	2KI	010	031	But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the Lord the God of Israel with all his heart: he departed not from the sins of Jerobo'am, who induced Israel to sin.
012	2KI	010	032	In those days the Lord began to cut Israel short; and Chazael smote them in all the boundary of Israel;
012	2KI	010	033	From the Jordan to the rising of the sun, all the land of Gil'ad, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Menassites, from 'Aro'er which is by the river Arnon, both Gil'ad and Bashan.
012	2KI	010	034	Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his mighty deeds, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
012	2KI	010	035	And Jehu slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoachaz his son became king in his stead.
012	2KI	010	036	And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty and eight years.
012	2KI	011	001	And when 'Athalyah the mother of Achazyahu saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal.
012	2KI	011	002	But Yehosheba', the daughter of king Joram, the sister of Achazyahu, took Joash the son of Achazyahu, and stole him away from among the king's sons that were slain, him and his nurse into the bed-chamber: and they hid him from 'Athalyah, so that he was not slain.
012	2KI	011	003	And he was with her in the house of the Lord hidden for six years, while 'Athalyah was reigning over the land.
012	2KI	011	004	And in the seventh year Yehoyada' sent and fetched the rulers over the hundreds, of the guards and the runners, and brought them to him into the house of the Lord, and made a covenant with them, and made them swear in the house of the Lord, and showed them the king's son.
012	2KI	011	005	And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall do: A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keeping watch in the king's house;
012	2KI	011	006	And a third part shall be at the gate of Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the runners; so shall ye keep watch at the house, as a defence.
012	2KI	011	007	And two parts of you all that are relieved on the sabbath, even they shall keep watch in the house of the Lord about the king.
012	2KI	011	008	And ye shall encompass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and he that cometh within the ranges shall be put to death: and be ye with the king when he goeth out and when he cometh in.
012	2KI	011	009	And the captains over the hundreds did in accordance with all that Yohayada' the priest had commanded: and they took every man his men that came in on the sabbath, with those that were to be relieved on the sabbath, and came to Yehoyada' the priest.
012	2KI	011	010	And the priest gave to the captains over the hundred the spears and shields that had belonged to king David, that were in the house of the Lord.
012	2KI	011	011	And the runners stood every man with his weapons in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, by the altar and within, round about the king.
012	2KI	011	012	And he brought forth the king's son, and put the crown upon him, and [gave him] the testimony, and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, Long live the king.
012	2KI	011	013	And when 'Athalyah heard the noise of the runners [and] of the people, she came to the people in the house of the Lord.
012	2KI	011	014	And she looked, and, behold, the king stood upon a stand, according to custom, and the princes and the trumpeters were by the king, and all the people of the land were rejoicing, and blowing with trumpets: and 'Athalyah then rent her clothes, and cried, Conspiracy! conspiracy!
012	2KI	011	015	But Yehoyada' the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the commanders of the army, and said unto them, Lead her forth to within the ranges: and him that followeth her put to death with the sword. For the priest had said, She shall not be slain in the house of the Lord.
012	2KI	011	016	And they made way for her; and she went by the way of the entrance of the horses into the king's house: and she was put to death there.
012	2KI	011	017	And Yehoyada' made a covenant between the Lord and between the king and between the people, that they should be a people unto the Lord; and between the king and between the people.
012	2KI	011	018	And then came all the people of the land into the house of Ba'al, and pulled it down: his altars and his images they broke in pieces thoroughly, and Mattan the priest of Ba'al they slew before the altars. And the priest appointed superintendents over the house of the Lord.
012	2KI	011	019	And he took the chiefs over hundreds, and the guards, and the runners, and all the people of the land, and they brought down the king from the house of the Lord, and came by the way of the gate of the runners to the king's house: and he sat on the throne of the kings.
012	2KI	011	020	And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet; but 'Athalyah they had slain with the sword at the king's house.
012	2KI	011	021	Seven years old was Jehoash when he became king.
012	2KI	012	001	In the seventh year of Jehu became Jehoash king; and forty years did he reign in Jerusalem; and the name of his mother was Zibyah of Beer-sheba'.
012	2KI	012	002	And Jehoash did what is right in the eyes of the Lord all his days, that Yehoyada' the priest instructed him.
012	2KI	012	003	Only the high-places were not removed: the people as yet sacrificed and burnt incense on the high-places.
012	2KI	012	004	And Jehoash said to the priests, all the money of the dedicated things that may be brought into the house of the Lord, the money of every one that passeth the numbering, the money any man is valued at, and all the money that cometh into any man's heart to bring into the house of the Lord,
012	2KI	012	005	The priests shall take to themselves, every man from his acquaintance; and they shall repair the breaches of the house, wheresoever any breach may be found.
012	2KI	012	006	But it happened, that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.
012	2KI	012	007	Then called king Jehoash for Yehoyada' the priest, and the [other] priests, and he said unto them, Wherefore do ye not repair the breaches of the house? and now ye shall take no more money from your acquaintances, but ye shall give it up [at once] for the breaches of the house.
012	2KI	012	008	And the priests consented neither to take any more money from the people, nor to repair the breaches of the house.
012	2KI	012	009	But Yehoyada' the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in its lid, and he placed it beside the altar, on the right side as one cometh into the house of the Lord: and the priests that kept watch at the threshold put therein all the money, that was brought into the house of the Lord.
012	2KI	012	010	And it happened, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king's scribe and the high-priest came up, and they put up in bags, after having counted, the money that was found in the house of the Lord.
012	2KI	012	011	And they gave the money, after it was counted, into the hands of those who overlooked the workmen, that had been appointed as overseers of the house of the Lord: and they laid it out to the carpenters and to the builders, that wrought on the house of the Lord,
012	2KI	012	012	And to the masons, and the hewers of stone, and for the purchase of timber and hewn stones to repair the breaches of the house of the Lord, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it.
012	2KI	012	013	Nevertheless there were not made for the house of the Lord bowls of silver, knives, basins, trumpets, all kinds of vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, from the money that was brought into the house of the Lord;
012	2KI	012	014	But they gave it to those who overlooked the workmen, and they repaired therewith the house of the Lord.
012	2KI	012	015	And they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to give it to those who overlooked the workmen; for they acted in good faith.
012	2KI	012	016	The money for trespass-offerings and the money for sin-offerings was not brought into the house of the Lord: it belonged to the priests.
012	2KI	012	017	At that time Chazael the king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and captured it: and Chazael directed his face to go up against Jerusalem.
012	2KI	012	018	Then took Jehoash the king of Judah all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, and Achazyahu, his fathers, the kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the Lord, and in the king's house, and sent it to Chazael the king of Syria: and he withdrew from Jerusalem.
012	2KI	012	019	And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah.
012	2KI	012	020	And his servants arose, and formed a conspiracy, and smote Joash in Beth-millo, which [lieth on the road] that goeth down to Silla.
012	2KI	012	021	And Yozachar the son of Shim'ath, and Yehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Amazyah his son became king in his stead.
012	2KI	013	001	In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Achazyahu the king of Judah became Jehoachaz the son of Jehu king over Israel in Samaria [for] seventeen years.
012	2KI	013	002	And he did what is evil in the eyes of the Lord, and followed the sins of Jerobo'am the son of Nebat, who induced Israel to sin: he departed not therefrom.
012	2KI	013	003	And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel; and he gave them up into the hand of Chazael the king of Syria, and into the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Chazael, all the time.
012	2KI	013	004	And Jehoachaz besought the Lord; and the Lord hearkened unto him; for he saw the oppression of Israel, how the king of Syria oppressed them.
012	2KI	013	005	(And the Lord gave Israel a deliverer, so that they came out from under the power of the Syrians: and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents, as in times past.
012	2KI	013	006	Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jerobo'am, who induced Israel to sin, therein the people walked: and the Asherah also remained standing in Samaria.)
012	2KI	013	007	For he had left of people to Jehoachaz none but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand men on foot; for the king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust at threshing.
012	2KI	013	008	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoachaz, and all that he did, and his mighty deeds, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
012	2KI	013	009	And Jehoachaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria: and Joash his son became king in his stead.
012	2KI	013	010	In the thirty and seventh year of Joash the king of Judah became Jehoash the son of Jehoachaz king over Israel in Samaria, [for] sixteen years.
012	2KI	013	011	And he did what is evil in the eyes of the Lord; he departed not from all the sins of Jerobo'am the son of Nebat, who induced Israel to sin: therein he walked.
012	2KI	013	012	And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his mighty deeds wherewith he fought against Amazyah the king of Judah, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
012	2KI	013	013	And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jerobo'am sat upon his throne: and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
012	2KI	013	014	Now Elisha' was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he had to die. And Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and their horsemen.
012	2KI	013	015	And Elisha' said unto him, Fetch a bow and arrows. And he fetched unto him a bow and arrows.
012	2KI	013	016	And he said to the king of Israel, Place thy hand upon the bow. And he placed his hand [upon it]: and Elisha' laid his hands upon the king's hands.
012	2KI	013	017	And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened it. Then said Elisha', Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of victory from the Lord, and the arrow of victory over Syria; and thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till they be consumed.
012	2KI	013	018	And he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said unto the king of Israel, Strike upon the ground. And he struck three times, and stopped.
012	2KI	013	019	And the man of God was angry with him, and said, Thou shouldst have struck five or six times; then wouldst thou have smitten the Syrians till they had been consumed: whereas now thou shalt smite the Syrians three times.
012	2KI	013	020	And Elisha' died, and they buried him. And the predatory bands of Moabites frequently invaded the land at the coming in of the year.
012	2KI	013	021	And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they saw the band; and they cast down the man into the sepulchre of Elisha': and as the man came, and touched the bones of Elisha', he revived, and rose up on his feet.
012	2KI	013	022	But Chazael the king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoachaz.
012	2KI	013	023	And the Lord became gracious unto them, and had mercy on them, and turned his regard unto them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, and he cast them not off from his presence even until now.
012	2KI	013	024	And Chazael the king of Syria died: and Ben-hadad his son became king in his stead.
012	2KI	013	025	And Jehoash the son of Jehoachaz took again the cities out of the power of Ben-hadad the son of Chazael, which he had taken out of the power of Jehoachaz his father in the war. Three times did Joash beat him, and he recovered the cities of Israel.
012	2KI	014	001	In the second year of Joash the son of Joachaz the king of Israel became Amazyahu, the son of Joash the king of Judah, king.
012	2KI	014	002	Twenty and five years was he old when he became king, and twenty and nine years did he reign in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Yeho'addan of Jerusalem.
012	2KI	014	003	And he did what is right in the eyes of the Lord, yet not like David his father: in accordance with all that Joash his father had done, [so] did he.
012	2KI	014	004	Nevertheless the high-places were not removed: as yet the people sacrificed and burnt incense on the high-places.
012	2KI	014	005	And it came to pass, when the kingdom was firmly established in his hand, that he slew his servants who had slain the king his father.
012	2KI	014	006	But the children of the murderers he put not to death: as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, that the Lord commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor shall the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin.
012	2KI	014	007	He it was that smote of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand men, and seized Sela' in the war, and called its name Yoktheel until this day.
012	2KI	014	008	Then sent Amazyah messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoachaz the son of Jehu, the king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.
012	2KI	014	009	And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amazyahu the king of Judah, saying, The thornbush that was in the Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in the Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son for wife. And there passed along the wild beasts that were in Lebanon, and trod down the thornbush.
012	2KI	014	010	Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thy heart hath lifted thee up: keep thy glory and stay in thy house; and why wilt thou meddle with misfortune, that thou mayest fall, thou, and Judah with thee?
012	2KI	014	011	But Amazyahu would not hear. Therefore Jehoash the king of Israel went up; and he and Amazyahu the king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth-shemesh, which belongeth to Judah.
012	2KI	014	012	And Judah was defeated before Israel; and they fled every man to his tents.
012	2KI	014	013	And Jehoash the king of Israel caught Amazyahu the king of Judah, the son of Jehoash, the son of Achazyahu, at Beth-shemesh; and he came to Jerusalem, and made a breach in the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner-gate, four hundred cubits.
012	2KI	014	014	And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of the Lord, and in the treasures of the king's house, and the children of the chiefs as hostages, and returned to Samaria.
012	2KI	014	015	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his mighty deeds, and how he fought with Amazyahu the king of Judah, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
012	2KI	014	016	And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel: and Jerobo'am his son became king in his stead.
012	2KI	014	017	And Amazyahu the son of Joash the king of Judah lived after the death of Jehoash, the son of Jehoachaz the king of Israel, fifteen years.
012	2KI	014	018	And the rest of the acts of Amazyahu, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah.
012	2KI	014	019	Now they raised a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem: wherefore he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.
012	2KI	014	020	And they brought him on horses: and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David.
012	2KI	014	021	And all the people of Judah took 'Azaryah, who was sixteen years old, and they made him king instead of his father Amazyahu.
012	2KI	014	022	He it was that built Elath, and brought it back to Judah, after the king slept with his fathers.
012	2KI	014	023	In the fifteenth year of Amazyahu the son of Joash the king of Judah became Jerobo'am the son of Joash the king of Israel king in Samaria, [for] forty and one years.
012	2KI	014	024	And he did what is evil in the eyes of the Lord: he departed not from all the sins of Jerobo'am the son of Nebat, who induced Israel to sin.
012	2KI	014	025	He restored the boundary of Israel from the entrance of Chamath unto the sea of the plain; in accordance with the word of the Lord God of Israel, which he had spoken by means of his servant Jonah the son of Amitthai, the prophet, who was of Gathchepher.
012	2KI	014	026	For the Lord saw the affliction of Israel, which was very bitter; that the guarded was no more, and that the fortified was no more, and there was no helper for Israel.
012	2KI	014	027	And the Lord had not spoken that he would blot out the name of Israel from under the heavens; but he helped them by means of Jerobo'am the son of Joash.
012	2KI	014	028	Now the rest of the acts of Jerobo'am, and all that he did, and his mighty deeds, how he warred, and how he brought back Damascus and Chamath, [which had belonged] to Judah, to Israel, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
012	2KI	014	029	And Jerobo'am slept with his fathers, with the kings of Israel: and Zechariah his son became king in his stead.
012	2KI	015	001	In the twenty and seventh year of Jerobo'am the king of Israel became 'Azaryah, the son of Amazyah king of Judah, king.
012	2KI	015	002	Sixteen years old was he when he became king, and two and fifty years did he reign in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Yecholyahu of Jerusalem.
012	2KI	015	003	And he did what is right in the eyes of the Lord, in accordance with all that Amazyahu his father had done;
012	2KI	015	004	Nevertheless the high-places were not removed: as yet the people sacrificed and burnt incense on the high-places.
012	2KI	015	005	And the Lord afflicted the king with leprosy, and he was a leper unto the day of his death, and he dwelt in the leper-house. And Jotham the king's son was over the house, [and] judged the people of the land.
012	2KI	015	006	And the rest of the acts of 'Azaryahu, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah.
012	2KI	015	007	And 'Azaryah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Jotham his son became king in his stead.
012	2KI	015	008	In the thirty and eighth year of 'Azaryahu the king of Judah became Zechariah the son of Jerobo'am king over Israel in Samaria [for] six months.
012	2KI	015	009	And he did what is evil in the eyes of the Lord, as his fathers had done: he departed not from the sins of Jerobo'am the son of Nebat, who induced Israel to sin.
012	2KI	015	010	And Shallum the son of Yabesh conspired against him, and smote him before the people, and put him to death, and became king in his stead.
012	2KI	015	011	And the rest of the acts of Zechariah, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
012	2KI	015	012	This was the word of the Lord which he spoke unto Jehu, saying, Sons of the fourth generation shall sit after thee on the throne of Israel. And so it came to pass.
012	2KI	015	013	Shallum the son of Yabesh became king in the nine and thirtieth year of 'Uzziyah the king of Judah; and he reigned for the space of one month in Samaria.
012	2KI	015	014	Then went up Menachem the son of Gadi from Thirzah, and came to Samaria, and smote Shallum the son of Yabesh in Samaria, and put him to death, and became king in his stead.
012	2KI	015	015	And the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he made, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
012	2KI	015	016	At that time did Menachem smite Thiphsach, and all that was therein, and its territory from Thirzah; because they opened not to him, he smote it; and all the pregnant women therein he ripped up.
012	2KI	015	017	In the nine and thirtieth year of 'Azaryah the king of Judah became Menachem the son of Gadi king over Israel, [for] ten years, in Samaria.
012	2KI	015	018	And he did what is evil in the eyes of the Lord: he departed not from the sins of Jerobo'am the son of Nebat, who induced Israel to sin, all his days.
012	2KI	015	019	[Then] came Pul the king of Assyria against the land: and Menachem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to strengthen the kingdom in his hand.
012	2KI	015	020	And Menachem exacted the money from all Israel, from all the mighty men of the army, to give to the king of Assyria, fifty shekels of silver from every man; and the king of Assyria then returned and stayed not there in the land.
012	2KI	015	021	And the rest of the acts of Menachem, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
012	2KI	015	022	And Menachem slept with his fathers; and Pekachyah his son became king in his stead.
012	2KI	015	023	In the fiftieth year of 'Azaryah the king of Judah became Pekachyah the son of Menachem king over Israel in Samaria, [for] two years.
012	2KI	015	024	And he did what is evil m the eyes of the Lord: he departed not from the sins of Jerobo'am the son of Nebat, who induced Israel to sin.
012	2KI	015	025	And Pekach the son of Remalyahu, an officer of his, conspired against him, and smote him in Samaria, in the fortress of the king's house, with the aid of Argob and the Aryeh, and with him were fifty men of the children of the Gil'adites: and he put him to death, and became king in his stead.
012	2KI	015	026	And the rest of the acts of Pekachyah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
012	2KI	015	027	In the fifty-second year of 'Azaryah the king of Judah became Pekach the son of Remalyahu king over Israel in Samaria, [for] twenty years.
012	2KI	015	028	And he did what is evil in the eyes of the Lord: he departed not from the sins of Jerobo'am the son of Nebat, who induced Israel to sin.
012	2KI	015	029	In the days of Pekach the king of Israel came Tiglath-pilesser the king of Assyria, and took 'Iyon, and Abel-beth, ma'achah, and Yanoach, and Kedesh, and Chazor, and Gil'ad, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and led them away as exiles to Assyria.
012	2KI	015	030	And Hoshea' the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekach the son of Remalyahu, and smote him, and put him to death, and became king in his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of 'Uzziyah.
012	2KI	015	031	And the rest of the acts of Pekach, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
012	2KI	015	032	In the second year of Pekach the son of Remalyahu the king of Israel became Jotham, the son of 'Uzziyah the king of Judah, king.
012	2KI	015	033	Five and twenty years old was he when he became king, and sixteen years did he reign in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Yerusha, the daughter of Zadok.
012	2KI	015	034	And he did what is right in the eyes of the Lord: in accordance with all that 'Uzziyahu his father had done, [so] did he.
012	2KI	015	035	Nevertheless, the high-places were not removed: as yet the people sacrificed and burnt incense on the high-places. He it was that built the upper gate of the house of the Lord.
012	2KI	015	036	Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah.
012	2KI	015	037	In those days began the Lord to send against Judah Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekach the son of Remalyahu.
012	2KI	015	038	And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Achaz his son became king in his stead.
012	2KI	016	001	In the seventeenth year of Pekach the son of Remalyahu, became Achaz, the son of Jotham the king of Judah, king.
012	2KI	016	002	Twenty years old was Achaz when he became king, and sixteen years did he reign in Jerusalem; and he did not what is right in the eyes of the Lord his God, like David his father.
012	2KI	016	003	But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and even his son he caused to pass through the fire, after the abominable acts of the nations whom the Lord had driven out from before the children of Israel.
012	2KI	016	004	And he sacrificed and burnt incense on the high-places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
012	2KI	016	005	Then came up Rezin the king of Syria and Pekach the son of Remalyahu the king of Israel to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Achaz, but were not able to make an attack.
012	2KI	016	006	At that time did Rezin the king of Syria bring Elath back to Syria, and drove the Jews from Elath: and the Edomeans came to Elath and dwelt there, even until this day.
012	2KI	016	007	And Achaz then sent messengers to Tiglath-pilesser the king of Assyria, saying, Thy servant and thy son am I: come up, and help me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, who rise up against me.
012	2KI	016	008	And Achaz took the silver and the gold that were found in the house of the Lord, and in the treasures of the king's house, and sent [the same] to the king of Assyria as a bribe.
012	2KI	016	009	And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him; and the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and captured it, and led [the people of] it away captive to Kir, and Rezin did he put to death.
012	2KI	016	010	And King Achaz went to meet Tiglath-pilesser the king of Assyria to Damascus, and he saw the altar that was at Damascus: and king Achaz then sent to Uriyah the priest the form of the altar, and its pattern, after all its workmanship.
012	2KI	016	011	And Uriyah the priest built the altar; in accordance with all that king Achaz had sent from Damascus, so did Uriyah the priest make it against the arrival of king Achaz from Damascus.
012	2KI	016	012	And when the king came from Damascus, the king saw the altar; and the king approached to the altar and offered thereon.
012	2KI	016	013	And he burnt his burnt-offering and his meat-offering, and poured out his drink-offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings upon the altar.
012	2KI	016	014	And as respecteth the copper altar which was before the Lord, he moved it back from the forefront of the house, from between the altar and the house of the Lord, and set it on the side of the altar to the north.
012	2KI	016	015	And king Achaz commanded Uriyah the priest, saying, Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt-offering, and the evening meat-offering, and the king's burnt-offering, and his meat-offering, with the burnt-offering of all the people of the land, and their meat-offering, and their drink-offerings; and all the blood of the burnt-offering, and all the blood of the sacrifices shalt thou sprinkle on it; and the copper altar shall be for me to visit occasionally.
012	2KI	016	016	And Uriyah the priest did in accordance with all that king Achaz had commanded.
012	2KI	016	017	And king Achaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the lavers from off them; and the sea he took down from off the copper oxen that were under it, and placed it upon a pavement of stones.
012	2KI	016	018	And the covered passage for the sabbath that they had built on the house, and the outer king's entrance, turned he from the house of the Lord, on account of the king of Assyria.
012	2KI	016	019	Now the rest of the acts of Achaz which he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah.
012	2KI	016	020	And Achaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son became king in his stead.
012	2KI	017	001	In the twelfth year of Achaz the king of Judah became Hoshea' the son of Elah king in Samaria over Israel, [for] nine years.
012	2KI	017	002	And he did what is evil in the eyes of the Lord, but not like the kings of Israel that were before him.
012	2KI	017	003	Against him came up Shalmanesser, the king of Assyria; and Hoshea' became his servant, and rendered him tribute.
012	2KI	017	004	And the king of Assyria discovered a conspiracy on Hoshea'; for he had sent messengers to So the king of Egypt, and had raised no tribute for the king of Assyria, as [before] year by year; and the king of Assyria made him prisoner, and shut him up in a prison-house.
012	2KI	017	005	And the king of Assyria came up over all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.
012	2KI	017	006	In the ninth year of Hoshea' did the king of Assyria capture Samaria, and he led Israel away as exiles into Assyria, and settled them in Chalach and in Chabor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of Media.
012	2KI	017	007	This took place, because the children of Israel had sinned against the Lord their God, who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and had feared other gods,
012	2KI	017	008	And had walked in the customs of the nations whom the Lord had driven out from before the children of Israel, and in those of the kings of Israel, which they had made.
012	2KI	017	009	And [because] the children of Israel had secretly done things that are not right against the Lord their God, and had built themselves high-places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen up to fortified cities;
012	2KI	017	010	And had set themselves up statues and groves on every high hill, and under every green tree;
012	2KI	017	011	And had burnt there incense on all the high-places, like the nations that the Lord had led away exiles before them; and wrought wicked things to provoke the Lord to anger;
012	2KI	017	012	And had served the idols, whereof the Lord had said unto them, Ye shall not do this thing.
012	2KI	017	013	The Lord had indeed warned Israel and Judah, by means of all the prophets, all the seers, saying, Turn ye back from your evil ways, and keep my commandments [and] my statutes, in accordance with all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I have sent to you by means of my servants the prophets.
012	2KI	017	014	But they would not hear, and hardened their neck, like the neck of their fathers, who had not believed in the Lord their God;
012	2KI	017	015	And they despised his statutes, and his covenant which he had made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he had entrusted to them; and they followed after what is vanity, and became vain, and followed after the nations that were round about them, concerning whom the Lord had charged them, not to do like them.
012	2KI	017	016	And they forsook all the commandments of the Lord their God, and made themselves molten images, two calves, and made a grove, and bowed down to all the host of the heavens, and served Ba'al;
012	2KI	017	017	And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divinations and enchantments, and sold themselves to do what is evil in the eyes of the Lord, to provoke him to anger.
012	2KI	017	018	Therefore became the Lord very angry with Israel, and he removed them from his presence: there was none left but the tribe of Judah alone.
012	2KI	017	019	Also Judah kept not the commandments of the Lord their God, but walked in the customs of Israel which they had made.
012	2KI	017	020	Therefore did the Lord reject all the seed of Israel, and he afflicted them, and gave them up into the hand of spoilers, until that he had cast them out of his presence.
012	2KI	017	021	For Israel had torn themselves from the house of David, and they made Jerobo'am the son of Nebat king: and Jerobo'am misled Israel from following the Lord, and caused them to commit a great sin;
012	2KI	017	022	And the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jerobo'am which he did; they departed not therefrom.
012	2KI	017	023	Until that the Lord removed Israel out of his presence, as he had spoken by means of all his servants the prophets; and Israel was led away as exiles out of their own land to Assyria even until this day.
012	2KI	017	024	And the king of Assyria brought [men] from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from 'Avva, and from Chamath, and from Sepharvayim, and settled them in the cities of Samaria in the room of the children of Israel: and they took possession of Samaria, and dwelt in its cities.
012	2KI	017	025	And it happened at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not the Lord; wherefore the Lord sent among them lions, which slew some of them.
012	2KI	017	026	And they said to the king of Assyria, as followeth, The nations that thou hast led away, and settled in the cities of Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land; wherefore he hath sent among them lions, and, behold, they are slaying them, since they know not the manner of the God of the land.
012	2KI	017	027	Then commanded the king of Assyria, saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom ye led away from there; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land.
012	2KI	017	028	And there came one of the priests whom they had led away as exiles from Samaria, and dwelt in Beth-el; and he taught them how they should fear the Lord.
012	2KI	017	029	Yet they made, every nation, their own gods; and they put them in the houses of the high-places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt.
012	2KI	017	030	And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Neregal, and the men of Chamath made Ashima.
012	2KI	017	031	And the 'Avvites made Nibchaz and Tharthak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in fire to 'Adrammelech and 'Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvayim.
012	2KI	017	032	And they feared [also] the Lord; and they made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high-places, and these sacrificed for them in the houses of the high-places.
012	2KI	017	033	The Lord did they fear, and their own gods did they serve, after the manner of the nations whence they had been led away.
012	2KI	017	034	Even until this day do they act after the former manners: they fear not the Lord, neither do they act after their own customs, and after their manner, nor after the law and after the commandment which the Lord commanded the children of Israel, whose name he styled Israel;
012	2KI	017	035	With whom the Lord had made a covenant, and charged them, saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves down to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them;
012	2KI	017	036	But the Lord, who hath brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great might and with an outstretched arm, him alone shall ye fear, and to him shall ye bow yourselves down, and to him shall ye sacrifice;
012	2KI	017	037	And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the commandment, which he hath written for you, shall ye observe to do for all time; and ye shall not fear other gods.
012	2KI	017	038	And the covenant that I have made with you shall ye not forget; and ye shall not fear other gods.
012	2KI	017	039	But the Lord your God shall ye fear; and he will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.
012	2KI	017	040	Nevertheless they have not hearkened, but they act after their former manner.
012	2KI	017	041	So were these nations, while they feared the Lord, also serving their graven images; and both their children and their children's children do until this day as their fathers have done.
012	2KI	018	001	And it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea' the son of Elah the king of Israel, that Hezekiah, the son of Achaz the king of Judah, became king.
012	2KI	018	002	Twenty and five years old was he when he became king, and twenty and nine years did he reign in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Abi, the daughter of Zechariah.
012	2KI	018	003	And he did what is right in the eyes of the Lord, in accordance with all that David his father had done.
012	2KI	018	004	He it was that removed the high-places, and broke the statues, and cut down the groves, and stamped in pieces the copper serpent that Moses had made; for unto those days were the children of Israel burning incense to it; and he called it Nechushtan.
012	2KI	018	005	In the Lord the God of Israel did he trust; and after him there was not his like among all the kings of Judah, nor among those that were before him.
012	2KI	018	006	And he adhered to the Lord, and turned not away from following him; but he kept his commandments, which the Lord had commanded Moses.
012	2KI	018	007	And the Lord was with him; whithersoever he went forth he prospered: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not.
012	2KI	018	008	He it was that smote the Philistines, as far as Gazzah, and its territory, from the tower of the watchmen up to the fortified city.
012	2KI	018	009	And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea' the son of Elah the king of Israel, that Shalmanesser the king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.
012	2KI	018	010	And they captured it at the end of three years, —in the sixth year of Hezekiah, that is the ninth year of Hoshea' the king of Israel, was Samaria captured.
012	2KI	018	011	And the king of Assyria led away Israel as exiles unto Assyria, and transported them to Chalach and to Chabor, by the river of Gozan, and to the cities of Media;
012	2KI	018	012	Because they had not obeyed the voice of the Lord their God, but had transgressed his covenant, all that Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded; and had not obeyed, nor done accordingly.
012	2KI	018	013	And in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib the king of Assyria come up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and seized on them.
012	2KI	018	014	And Hezekiah the king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have sinned; retire from me: what thou wilt impose on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria exacted from Hezekiah the king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
012	2KI	018	015	And Hezekiah gave up all the silver that was found in the house of the Lord, and in the treasures of the king's house.
012	2KI	018	016	At that time did Hezekiah cut off [the gold from] the doors of the temple of the Lord, and from the door-sills which Hezekiah the king of Judah had overlaid, and gave the same to the king of Assyria.
012	2KI	018	017	And the king of Assyria sent Tharthan and Rub-sariss and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a strong army against Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem; and when they were come up, they came and halted by the aqueduct of the upper pool, which is on the highway of the washer's field.
012	2KI	018	018	And they called for the king, when there came out to them Elyakim the son of Chilkiyahu, who was superintendent over the house, and Shebnah the scribe, and Yoach the son of Assaph the recorder.
012	2KI	018	019	And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus hath said the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherewith thou hast trusted?
012	2KI	018	020	Thou saidst, but it was only a word uttered with the lips, [I have] counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom didst thou trust, that thou rebelledst against me?
012	2KI	018	021	Now, behold, thou trustedst thee upon yon cracked reed-staff, upon Egypt, which, if a man lean on it, will enter into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh the king of Egypt unto all that trust on him.
012	2KI	018	022	But if ye should say unto me, In the Lord our God have we trusted: is he not the one whose high-places and whose altars Hezekiah hath removed, when he said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Before this altar shall ye prostrate yourselves in Jerusalem?
012	2KI	018	023	And now, I pray thee, enter into a contest with my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.
012	2KI	018	024	How then wilt thou turn back the face of a single chieftain among the least of my master's servants, while thou hast put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen!
012	2KI	018	025	Now am I come up without the Lord ['s will] against this place to destroy it? The Lord hath said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.
012	2KI	018	026	Then said Elyakim the son of Chilkiyahu, and Shebnah, and Yoach, unto Rabshakeh, Speak, we pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and speak not with us in the Jewish language before the ears of the people that are on the wall.
012	2KI	018	027	But Rabshakeh said unto them, Hath my master then sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? is it not rather to the men who sit on the wall, that they may eat their own excrement, and drink their own urine with you?
012	2KI	018	028	Then stood Rabshakeh up and called out with a loud voice in the Jewish language, and spoke, and said, Hear ye the word of the great king, the king of Assyria:
012	2KI	018	029	Thus hath said the king. Let not Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you out of his hand;
012	2KI	018	030	Neither let Hezekiah induce you to trust in the Lord, saying, The Lord will surely deliver us, and this city will not be given up into the hand of the king of Assyria:
012	2KI	018	031	Hearken not to Hezekiah; for thus hath said the king of Assyria, Make a treaty of peace with me, and come out to me, and eat ye every man of his own vine, and every man of his fig-tree, and drink ye every man the waters of his cistern;
012	2KI	018	032	Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil-olive trees, and of honey, that ye may live, and not die; and hearken not unto Hezekiah; for he will mislead you, saying, The Lord will deliver us.
012	2KI	018	033	Have the gods of the nations delivered in anywise each his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
012	2KI	018	034	Where are the gods of Chamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvayim, Hena', and 'Ivvah? have they then delivered Samaria out of my hand?
012	2KI	018	035	Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?
012	2KI	018	036	But the people remained silent, and answered him not a word; for it was the king's command, saying, Ye shall not answer him.
012	2KI	018	037	Then came Elyakim the son of Chilkiyah, who was superintendent over the house, and Shebnah the scribe, and Yoach the son of Assaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent; and they told unto him the words of Rabshakeh.
012	2KI	019	001	And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the Lord.
012	2KI	019	002	And he sent Elyakim, who was superintendent over the house, and Shebnah the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.
012	2KI	019	003	And they said unto him, Thus hath said Hezekiah, A day of trouble, and of rebuke, and derision is this day; for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.
012	2KI	019	004	Perhaps the Lord thy God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to blaspheme the living God; and who hath reproached with the words which the Lord thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up a prayer in behalf of the remnant that is still found here.
012	2KI	019	005	And the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
012	2KI	019	006	And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus hath said the Lord, Be not afraid because of the words which thou hast heard, with which the boys of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
012	2KI	019	007	Behold, I will put an [other] spirit in him, that when he will hear a rumor, he shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
012	2KI	019	008	And Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.
012	2KI	019	009	And he heard it said of Thirhakah the king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to fight with thee; and he again sent messengers unto Hezekiah, saying,
012	2KI	019	010	Thus shall ye say to Hezekiah the king of Judah, as followeth, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given up into the hand of the king of Assyria.
012	2KI	019	011	Behold, thou thyself hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands, by destroying them utterly: and thou alone shouldst be delivered?
012	2KI	019	012	Have the gods of the nations which my fathers destroyed delivered them; as Gozan, and Charan, and Rezeph, and the children of 'Eden, who were in Thelassar?
012	2KI	019	013	Where is the king of Chamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvayim, of Hena', and 'Ivvah?
012	2KI	019	014	And Hezekiah took the letters out of the hand of the messengers, and read them: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the Lord, and spread them out before the Lord.
012	2KI	019	015	And Hezekiah prayed before the Lord, and said, O Lord God of Israel, who dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the [true] God, thou alone, for all the kingdoms of the earth; for it is thou who hast made the heavens and the earth.
012	2KI	019	016	Bend down, O Lord, thy ear, and hear! open, O Lord, thy eyes, and see! and hear the words of Sennacherib, that which he hath sent to blaspheme the living God.
012	2KI	019	017	Truly, Lord, the kings of Assyria have devastated the nations and their land,
012	2KI	019	018	And they have placed their gods into the fire; for they are no gods, but the work of man's hands, wood and stone: and these have they destroyed.
012	2KI	019	019	And now, O Lord our God, save us, I beseech thee, out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the Lord God, thou alone.
012	2KI	019	020	Then sent Isaiah the son of Amoz to Hezekiah, saying, Thus hath said the Lord the God of Israel, What thou hast prayed to me concerning Sennacherib the king of Assyria have I heard.
012	2KI	019	021	This is the word that the Lord hath spoken over him: She despiseth thee, she laugheth thee to scorn, the virgin daughter of Zion; behind thee shaketh her head the daughter of Jerusalem.
012	2KI	019	022	Whom hast thou blasphemed, and [whom] hast thou scorned? and against whom hast thou raised thy voice, and lifted up thy eyes on high? against the Holy One of Israel.
012	2KI	019	023	By thy messengers thou hast blasphemed the Lord and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots am I indeed come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and I will cut down its tall cedars, the choice of its fir-trees: and I will enter into the lodgings on its summit, the forest of its fruitful soil.
012	2KI	019	024	I have dug and drunk strange waters, and I will dry up with the sole of my feet all the streams of besieged places.
012	2KI	019	025	Hadst thou not heard that in distant ages I had prepared this? in the times of antiquity when I formed it? now have I brought it along, and it came to pass, to desolate into ruinous heaps fortified cities.
012	2KI	019	026	And thus their inhabitants were short of power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the herbs of the field, and as the green grass; as the moss on the housetops, and as corn blasted before the ear appeareth.
012	2KI	019	027	But thy abiding and thy going out and thy coming in do I know, and thy raging against me.
012	2KI	019	028	Because of thy raging against me and thy tumult that is come up into my ears, will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle between thy lips; and I will cause thee to turn back on the way by which thou camest.
012	2KI	019	029	And this shall be unto thee the sign, Ye shall eat this year what groweth of itself, and in the second year what springeth up after the same; and in the third year sow and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.
012	2KI	019	030	And the remnant of the house of Judah that is escaped shall yet again strike root downward, and bear fruit upward.
012	2KI	019	031	For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and that which escapeth out of mount Zion: the zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this.
012	2KI	019	032	Therefore thus hath said the Lord concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, and he shall not shoot an arrow thereon, nor come before it with shield, nor cast up against it an embankment.
012	2KI	019	033	On the way by which he came, by the same shall he return, and into this city shall he not come, saith the Lord.
012	2KI	019	034	And I will shield this city, to save it, for my own sake, and for the sake of David my servant.
012	2KI	019	035	And it came to pass, on the same night, that an angel of the Lord went out and smote in the camp of the Assyrians one hundred eighty and five thousand men: and when people arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.
012	2KI	019	036	And Sennacherib the king of Assyria then departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.
012	2KI	019	037	And it came to pass, as he was prostrating himself in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Essar-chaddon his son became king in his stead.
012	2KI	020	001	In those days Hezekiah fell sick unto death; and there came to him Isaiah the son of Amoz the prophet, and said unto him, Thus hath said the Lord, Give thy charge to thy house; for thou shalt die, and not live.
012	2KI	020	002	Then did he turn his face to the wall, and prayed unto the Lord, saying,
012	2KI	020	003	I beseech thee, O Lord, remember now that I have walked before thee in truth, and with an undivided heart, and have done what is good in thy eyes. And Hezekiah wept aloud.
012	2KI	020	004	And it came to pass, before Isaiah was gone out into the middle court, that the word of the Lord came to him, saying,
012	2KI	020	005	Return, and say to Hezekiah the ruler of my people, Thus hath said the Lord, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears; behold, I will heal thee: on the third day shalt thou go up unto the house of the Lord.
012	2KI	020	006	And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and out of the hand of the king of Assyria will I deliver thee and this city; and I will shield this city for my own sake, and for the sake of David my servant.
012	2KI	020	007	And Isaiah said, Fetch a lump of figs. And they fetched and laid it on the inflammation, and he recovered.
012	2KI	020	008	And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What sign shall there be that the Lord will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the Lord the third day?
012	2KI	020	009	And Isaiah said, This shall be unto thee the sign from the Lord, that the Lord will do the thing that he hath spoken: Shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?
012	2KI	020	010	And Hezekiah said, It is a light thing for the shadow to go forward ten degrees: no; but let the shadow return backward ten degrees.
012	2KI	020	011	And Isaiah the prophet called unto the Lord; and he caused the shadow to return, by the degrees which the [sun] was gone down on the dial of Achaz, backward, ten degrees.
012	2KI	020	012	And at that time sent Berodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, the king of Babylon, letters and a present unto Hezekiah; for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.
012	2KI	020	013	And Hezekiah listened unto them, and showed them the whole of his treasure-house, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and the whole of his armor-house, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing that Hezekiah showed them not, in his house and in all his dominion.
012	2KI	020	014	Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What did these men say? and whence did they come unto thee? And Hezekiah said, From a far off country are they come, from Babylon.
012	2KI	020	015	And he said, What did they see in thy house? And Hezekiah answered, All that is in my house have they seen: there was nothing that I did not show them in my treasures.
012	2KI	020	016	And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the Lord,
012	2KI	020	017	Behold, days are coming, when all that is in thy house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the Lord.
012	2KI	020	018	And of thy sons that will issue from thee, whom thou wilt beget, shall they take; and they shall be court-servants in the palace of the king of Babylon.
012	2KI	020	019	Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of the Lord which thou hast spoken. And he said, Is it not so, if there be peace and stability in my days?
012	2KI	020	020	And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his mighty deeds, and how he made the pool, and the aqueduct, and brought the water into the city, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah.
012	2KI	020	021	And Hezekiah slept with his fathers: and Menasseh his son became king in his stead.
012	2KI	021	001	Twelve years old was Menasseh when he became king, and fifty and five years did he reign in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Chephzi-bah.
012	2KI	021	002	And he did what is evil in the eyes of the Lord, after the abominable acts of the nations whom the Lord had driven out before the children of Israel.
012	2KI	021	003	And he built up again the high-places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Ba'al, and made a grove, as Achab the king of Israel had done; and he bowed down to all the host of heaven, and served them.
012	2KI	021	004	And he built altars in the house of the Lord, of which the Lord had said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.
012	2KI	021	005	And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord.
012	2KI	021	006	And he caused his son to pass through the fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he wrought much that is evil in the eyes of the Lord, to provoke him to anger.
012	2KI	021	007	And he set a hewn image of the Asherah that he had made in the house, of which the Lord had said to David, and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:
012	2KI	021	008	And I will not cause any more the foot of Israel to move out of the land which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe to act in accordance with all that I have commanded them, and in accordance with all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.
012	2KI	021	009	But they hearkened not: and Menasseh seduced them to do what is evil more than the nations whom the Lord had destroyed before the children of Israel.
012	2KI	021	010	And the Lord spoke by means of his servants the prophets, saying,
012	2KI	021	011	Forasmuch as Menasseh the king of Judah hath done these abominations, having done wickedly more than all that the Emorites had done, who were before him, and hath induced Judah also to sin with his idols:
012	2KI	021	012	Therefore thus hath said the Lord the God of Israel, Behold, I will bring evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.
012	2KI	021	013	And I will stretch over Jerusalem the measure-line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Achab: and I will wipe off Jerusalem as one wipeth off a dish, wiping it, and turning it on its face.
012	2KI	021	014	And I will forsake the remnant of my inheritance, and give them up into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;
012	2KI	021	015	Forasmuch as they have done what is evil in my eyes, and have been provoking me to anger, from the day that their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even until this day.
012	2KI	021	016	And also innocent blood did Menasseh shed in very great abundance, till he had filled [therewith] Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin wherewith he induced Judah to sin, to do what is evil in the eyes of the Lord.
012	2KI	021	017	Now the rest of the acts of Menasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he committed, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah.
012	2KI	021	018	And Menasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of 'Uzza: and Amon his son became king in his stead.
012	2KI	021	019	Twenty and two years old was Amon when he became king, and two years did he reign in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Meshullemeth, the daughter of Charuz of Yotbah.
012	2KI	021	020	And he did what is evil in the eyes of the Lord, as his father Menasseh had done.
012	2KI	021	021	And he walked in all the way that his father had walked in, and served the idols that his father had served, and bowed himself down to them;
012	2KI	021	022	And he forsook the Lord the God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the Lord.
012	2KI	021	023	And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and put the king to death in his own house.
012	2KI	021	024	And the people of the land slew all those that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.
012	2KI	021	025	Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah.
012	2KI	021	026	And they buried him in his sepulchre in the garden of 'Uzza: and Josiah his son became king in his stead.
012	2KI	022	001	Eight years old was Josiah when he became king, and thirty and one years did he reign in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Yedidah, the daughter of 'Adayah of Bozkath.
012	2KI	022	002	And he did what is right in the eyes of the Lord, and walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not aside to the right or to the left.
012	2KI	022	003	And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azalyahu, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the Lord, saying,
012	2KI	022	004	Go up to Chilkiyahu the high-priest, that he may collect up all the money which is brought into the house of the Lord, which the door-keepers have gathered from the people:
012	2KI	022	005	And let them deliver it into the hand of those who overlook the workmen, that have been appointed as overseers of the house of the Lord; and let them give it to those who do the work who are in the house of the Lord, to repair the breaches of the house:
012	2KI	022	006	Unto the carpenters, and the builders, and the masons, and to buy timber and hewn stones to repair the house.
012	2KI	022	007	Nevertheless shall there be no reckoning made with them for the money that is delivered into their hand, because they deal faithfully.
012	2KI	022	008	And Chilkiyahu the high-priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, A book of the law have I found in the house of the Lord. And Chilkiyah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.
012	2KI	022	009	And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, Thy servants have taken out all the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of those who overlook the workmen, that have been appointed overseers of the house of the Lord.
012	2KI	022	010	And Shaphan the scribe also told the king, saying, A book hath Chilkiyahu the priest given me. And Shaphan read it before the king.
012	2KI	022	011	And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his clothes.
012	2KI	022	012	And the king commanded Chilkiyah the priest, and Achikam the son of Shaphan, and 'Achbor the son of Michayah, and Shaphan the scribe, and 'Assahyah a servant of the king's, saying,
012	2KI	022	013	Go ye, inquire of the Lord in my behalf, and in behalf of the people, and in behalf of all Judah, concerning the words of this book that hath been found; for great is the wrath of the Lord that hath been kindled against us, because our fathers did not hearken unto the words of this book, to do in accordance with all that is prescribed concerning us.
012	2KI	022	014	And Chilkiyahu the priest, and Achikam, and 'Achbor, and Shaphan, and 'Assahyah, went unto Chuldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah the son of Charchass, the keeper of the wardrobe; [now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the suburb;] and they spoke unto her.
012	2KI	022	015	And she said unto them, Thus hath said the Lord the God of Israel, Say unto the man that hath sent you to me,
012	2KI	022	016	Thus hath said the Lord, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon its inhabitants, all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read;
012	2KI	022	017	Because they have forsaken me, and have burnt incense unto other gods, in order to provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands: therefore is my wrath kindled against this place, and shall not be quenched.
012	2KI	022	018	But with respect to the king of Judah who sendeth you to inquire of the Lord, thus shall ye say to him, Thus hath said the Lord the God of Israel, Concerning the words which thou hast heard;
012	2KI	022	019	Because thy heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself before the Lord, when thou heardest what I had spoken against this place, and against its inhabitants, that they should become an astonishment and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me: I also have heard it, saith the Lord.
012	2KI	022	020	Therefore, behold, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered unto thy graves in peace; and thy eyes shall not look on all the evil which I am bringing over this place. And they brought the king word again.
012	2KI	023	001	And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
012	2KI	023	002	And the king went up into the house of the Lord, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, from the small to the great: and he read before their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which had been found in the house of the Lord.
012	2KI	023	003	And the king stood upon the stand, and he made a covenant before the Lord, to walk after the Lord, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies and his statutes with all [their] heart and all [their] soul, to maintain the words of this covenant that are written in this book. And all the people entered into the covenant.
012	2KI	023	004	And the king commanded Chilkiyahu the high-priest, and the priests of the second order, and the door-keepers, to carry forth out of the temple of the Lord all the vessels that had been made for Ba'al, and for the Asherah, and for all the host of heaven: and they burnt them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried their ashes unto Beth-el.
012	2KI	023	005	And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had appointed that they might burn incense on the high-places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; those also that burnt incense unto Ba'al, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.
012	2KI	023	006	And he brought out the Asherah from the house of the Lord, without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burnt it at the brook Kidron, and ground it small to powder, and cast its powder upon the graves of the children of the people.
012	2KI	023	007	And he pulled down the houses of the sodomites, that were by the house of the Lord, where the women wove hangings for the Asherah.
012	2KI	023	008	And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high-places where the priests had burnt incense, from Geba' to Beer-Sheba', and he pulled down the high-places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a man's left at the gate of the city.
012	2KI	023	009	Nevertheless the priests of the high-places came not up to the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem; but they ate unleavened bread in the midst of their brethren.
012	2KI	023	010	And he defiled the Thopheth, which was in the valley Ben-hinnom, so that no man should cause his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.
012	2KI	023	011	And he put down the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun, from the entrance of the house of the Lord, by the chamber of Nethan-melech the chamberlain, who was over the suburbs; and the chariots of the sun he burnt with fire.
012	2KI	023	012	And the altars that were on the roof of the upper-chamber of Achaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Menasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the Lord, did the king pull down, and tore them away from there, and cast their dust into the brook Kidron.
012	2KI	023	013	And the high-places that were before Jerusalem, which were to the right of the mount of destruction, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for 'Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Kemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of 'Ammon, did the king defile.
012	2KI	023	014	And he broke in pieces the standing images, and cut down the Asherah-groves, and filled their places with the bones of men.
012	2KI	023	015	So also the altar that was at Beth-el, the high-place which Jerobo'am the son of Nebat, who induced Israel to sin, had made, —also that altar and the high-place did he pull down; and he burnt the high-place, ground it small to powder, and burnt then the Asherah.
012	2KI	023	016	And Josiah turned about, and beheld the graves that were there in the mount, and he sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchres, and burnt them upon the altar, and polluted it, according to the word of the Lord which the man of God proclaimed, who had proclaimed these events.
012	2KI	023	017	Then said he, What kind of monument is that which I see? And the men of the city said to him, It is the grave of the man of God, who came from Judah, and proclaimed these things which thou hast done against the altar of Beth-el.
012	2KI	023	018	And he said, Let him rest: no man shall disturb his bones. So they saved his bones, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria.
012	2KI	023	019	And also all the houses of the high-places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made as provocations to anger, did Josiah remove, and did to them in accordance with all the acts that he had done in Beth-el.
012	2KI	023	020	And he slaughtered all the priests of the high-places that were there upon the altars, and burnt men's bones upon them, and returned [then] to Jerusalem.
012	2KI	023	021	And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover unto the Lord your God, as it is written in this book of the covenant.
012	2KI	023	022	For there had not been holden such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel; nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, and of the kings of Judah;
012	2KI	023	023	But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah was this passover holden to the Lord in Jerusalem.
012	2KI	023	024	And also the men of familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the teraphim, and the idols, and all the abominations that were to be seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah clear away; in order that he might accomplish the words of the law which were written in the book that Chilkiyahu the priest had found in the house of the Lord.
012	2KI	023	025	And like unto him there was no king before him, that returned to the Lord with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; and after him there arose none like him.
012	2KI	023	026	Notwithstanding this the Lord turned not from the fierceness of his great anger, since his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provokings wherewith Menasseh had provoked him to anger.
012	2KI	023	027	And the Lord said, Also Judah will I remove out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and will cast off this city which I have chosen, even Jerusalem, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.
012	2KI	023	028	Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah.
012	2KI	023	029	In his days went up Pharaoh-nechoh the king of Egypt against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he saw him.
012	2KI	023	030	And his servants carried him dying in a chariot from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre. And the people of the land took Jehoachaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father's stead.
012	2KI	023	031	Twenty and three years old was Jehoachaz when he became king; and three months did he reign in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Chamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
012	2KI	023	032	And he did what is evil in the eyes of the Lord, all just as his fathers had done.
012	2KI	023	033	And Pharaoh-nechoh put him in fetters at Riblah in the land of Chamath, that he should not reign in Jerusalem, and imposed a fine on the land of a hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.
012	2KI	023	034	And Pharaoh-nechoh made Elyakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, and changed his name to Jehoyakim, and took Jehoachaz away: and he came to Egypt, and died there.
012	2KI	023	035	And Jehoyakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money by the order of Pharaoh: from every one according to his estimation did he exact the silver and gold from the people of the land, to give it unto Pharaoh-nechoh.
012	2KI	023	036	Twenty and five years old was Jehoyakim when he became king; and eleven years did be reign in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Zebudah, the daughter of Pedayah of Rumah.
012	2KI	023	037	And he did what is evil in the eyes of the Lord, all just as his fathers had done.
012	2KI	024	001	In his days came up Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and Jehoyakim became his servant for three years: and then he returned and rebelled against him.
012	2KI	024	002	And the Lord sent against him predatory bands of the Chaldeans, and predatory bands of the Syrians, and predatory bands of the Moabites, and predatory bands of the children of 'Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the Lord, which he had spoken by means of his servants the prophets.
012	2KI	024	003	But only at the order of the Lord came this upon Judah, to remove the same out of his sight, for the sins of Menasseh, in accordance with all that he had done;
012	2KI	024	004	And also for the innocent blood that he had shed; for he had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; wherefore the Lord would not pardon.
012	2KI	024	005	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoyakim, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah.
012	2KI	024	006	And Jehoyakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoyachin his son became king in his stead.
012	2KI	024	007	And the king of Egypt came no more again out of his land; for the king of Babylon had taken from the brook of Egypt unto the river Euphrates all that had pertained to the king of Egypt.
012	2KI	024	008	Eighteen years old was Jehoyachin when he became king, and three months did he reign in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Nechushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.
012	2KI	024	009	And he did what is evil in the eyes of the Lord, all just as that his father had done.
012	2KI	024	010	At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem, and the city was put in a state of siege.
012	2KI	024	011	And Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon came against the city, while his servants were besieging it.
012	2KI	024	012	And Jehoyachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his court-officers: and the king of Babylon took him [captive] in the eighth year of his reign.
012	2KI	024	013	And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon the king of Israel had made in the temple of the Lord, as the Lord had spoken.
012	2KI	024	014	And he led away as exiles all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, ten thousand exiles, and all the craftsmen and locksmiths: there was none left, save the poorest sort of the people of the land.
012	2KI	024	015	And he led away Jehoyachin as exile to Babylon; and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his court-officers, and the mighty men of the land, he led into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon.
012	2KI	024	016	And all the men of might, seven thousand [in number], and the craftsmen and the locksmiths a thousand [in number], all strong men, apt for war; and the king of Babylon brought them into exile to Babylon.
012	2KI	024	017	And the king of Babylon made Mattanyah his uncle king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.
012	2KI	024	018	Twenty and one years old was Zedekiah when he became king, and eleven years did he reign in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Chamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
012	2KI	024	019	And he did what is evil in the eyes of the Lord, all just as Jehoyakim had done.
012	2KI	024	020	For through the anger of the Lord it occurred in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
012	2KI	025	001	And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon came, he, and all his host, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built a mound all around about it.
012	2KI	025	002	And the city was put in a state of siege until the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
012	2KI	025	003	And on the ninth of the month, when the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land:
012	2KI	025	004	The city was broken into, and all the men of war [fled] in the night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king's garden; [while the Chaldeans were all round about the city;] and the people went the way toward the plain.
012	2KI	025	005	And the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were scattered from around him.
012	2KI	025	006	And they seized the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they called him to account.
012	2KI	025	007	And they slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and he blinded the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried him to Babylon.
012	2KI	025	008	And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, came Nebusaradan, the chief of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem:
012	2KI	025	009	And he burnt the house of the Lord, and the king's house; also, all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great man's house burnt he with fire.
012	2KI	025	010	And the walls of Jerusalem round about did all the army of the Chaldeans that were with the captain of the guard tear down.
012	2KI	025	011	And the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the deserters that had run over to the king of Babylon, with the remnant of the multitude, did Nebusaradan the captain of the guard lead away into exile;
012	2KI	025	012	But from the poorest of the land the captain of the guard left some to be vine-dressers and husbandmen.
012	2KI	025	013	And the pillars of copper that were in the house of the Lord, and the bases, and the copper sea that was in the house of the Lord, did the Chaldeans break up, and they carried the copper thereof to Babylon.
012	2KI	025	014	And the pots, and the shovels, and the knives, and the spoons, and all the vessels of copper wherewith they ministered, took they away.

012	2KI	025	018	And the captain of the guard took Serayah the chief-priest, and Zephanyahu the second priest, and the three door-keepers;
012	2KI	025	019	And out of the city he took one court-officer that was appointed over the men of war, and five men of those that could come into the king's presence, who were found in the city, and the scribe of the chief of the army, who ordered to the army the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land that were found in the city:
012	2KI	025	020	And Nebusaradan the captain of the guard took these, and conducted them to the king of Babylon to Riblah;
012	2KI	025	021	And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Chamath. So did Judah wander away into exile out of their land.
012	2KI	025	022	And as for the people that were left in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had left, he appointed over them Gedalyahu the son of Achikam, the son of Shaphan.
012	2KI	025	023	And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedalyahu, they came to Gedalyahu to Mizpah; even Ishma'el the son of Nethanyah, and Jochanan the son of Kareach, and Serayah the son of Tanchumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazanyahu the son of a Ma'achathite, they and their men.
012	2KI	025	024	And Gedalyahu swore to them, and to their men, and said unto them, Be not afraid of the servants of the Chaldeans: remain in the land, and serve the king of Babylon; and it will be well with you.
012	2KI	025	025	But it happened in the seventh month, that there came Ishma'el the son of Nethanyah, the son of Elishama', of the seed royal, and ten men with him, and they smote Gedalyahu, so that he died, also the Jews and the Chaldeans that were with him at Mizpah.
012	2KI	025	026	And then arose all the people, from small to great, and the captains of the armies, and went to Egypt; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans.
012	2KI	025	027	And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoyachin the king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth [day] of the month, that Evil-merodach the king of Babylon in the year that he became king did lift up the head of Jehoyachin the king of Judah out of the prison;
012	2KI	025	028	And he spoke kindly to him, and set his chair above the chair of the kings that were with him in Babylon:
012	2KI	025	029	And changed his prison garments: and he ate bread continually before him all the days of his life.
012	2KI	025	030	And his allowance was a continual allowance given him by the king, the necessary ration for the day on its day, all the days of his life.

013	1CH	009	024	On four quarters were the gatekeepers, toward the east, the west, the north, and the south.
013	1CH	009	025	And their brethren, who were in their villages, had to come after every seven days from time to time in common with these.
013	1CH	009	026	For in [their] trust were these four chief gatekeepers— these Levites, and they were [appointed] over the chambers and treasuries of the house of God.
013	1CH	009	027	And they lodged round about the house of God; because upon them rested the duty of watching, and they had the supervision of the opening thereof each and every morning.
013	1CH	009	028	And some of them had the charge of the vessels for the service; for by number did they bring them in, and by number did they carry them out.
013	1CH	009	029	Some of them also were appointed over the vessels, and over all the vessels of the sanctuary, and over the fine flour, and the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices.

013	1CH	009	034	These are the chiefs of the divisions of the Levites, being the chiefs for their generations: these dwelt at Jerusalem.
013	1CH	009	035	And in Gib'on dwelt the father of Gib'on, Je'iel; and the name of his wife was Ma'achah;

013	1CH	010	001	Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled before the Philistines, and there fell down [many] slain on mount Gilboa'.
013	1CH	010	002	And the Philistines pursuing them overtook Saul and his sons; and the Philistines smote Jonathan, and 'Abinadab, and Malkishua', the sons of Saul.
013	1CH	010	003	And the battle was heavy against Saul, and he was found by the archers, and he was greatly in dread of the archers.
013	1CH	010	004	And Saul said to his armor-bearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and wantonly ill-use me. But his armor-bearer would not; for he was greatly afraid: wherefore Saul took the sword and fell upon it.
013	1CH	010	005	And when the armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, then fell he likewise on the sword, and died.
013	1CH	010	006	Thus died Saul and his three sons; and all his household died together.
013	1CH	010	007	And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that they had fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead: they forsook their cities, and fled, and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
013	1CH	010	008	And it came to pass on the morrow, that the Philistines came to strip the slain; and they found Saul and his sons fallen on mount Gilboa'.
013	1CH	010	009	And they stripped him, and they carried away his head, and his armor, and sent them into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it to their idols, and to the people.
013	1CH	010	010	And they put his armor in the house of their gods, and his skull they fastened in the temple of Dagon.
013	1CH	010	011	And when all Yabesh-gil'ad heard all the Philistines had done to Saul:
013	1CH	010	012	Then arose all the valiant men, and carried away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Yabesh; and they buried their bones under the terebinth in Yabesh, and they fasted seven days.
013	1CH	010	013	And [so] died Saul for his unfaithfulness which he had committed against the Lord, because of the word of the Lord which he had not kept, and also for asking one of a familiar spirit to inquire of the same;
013	1CH	010	014	And had not inquired of the Lord: therefore he slew him, and turned over the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse.
013	1CH	011	001	Then did all Israel gather themselves unto David unto Hebron, saying Behold, thy bone and thy flesh are we.
013	1CH	011	002	Already yesterday and even before, even when Saul was king, thou wast he that led out and brought in Israel; and the Lord, thy God, said unto thee, Thou shalt indeed feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be truly a chief over my people Israel.
013	1CH	011	003	Thus came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the Lord; and they anointed David as king over Israel, according to the word of the Lord through means of Samuel.
013	1CH	011	004	And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus; and there were the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land.
013	1CH	011	005	And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come in hither. Nevertheless David captured the strong-hold of Zion, the same is the City of David.
013	1CH	011	006	And David said, Whosoever doth smite the Jebusites at first shall be head and chief. Then did Joab the son of Zeruyah go up at first, and became head-man.
013	1CH	011	007	And David dwelt in the castle: therefore they called it, “The City of David.”
013	1CH	011	008	And he built the city round about, even from the Millo as far as the surrounding district, and Joab repaired the rest of the city.
013	1CH	011	009	And David want on, and became greater and greater, and the lord of hosts was with him.
013	1CH	011	010	These also are the principals of the mighty men whom David had, who held firmly with him in his kingdom, with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the Lord concerning Israel.
013	1CH	011	011	And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jashoh'am, the son of Chachmoni, the chief of the captains, who lifted up his spear against three hundred slain at one time.
013	1CH	011	012	And after him was El'asar the son of Dodo, the Achochite, who was one of the three mighty men.
013	1CH	011	013	He was with David at Pass-dammim, and the Philistines were gathered together there to battle, and there was a piece of ground full of barley; and the people had fled from before the Philistines.
013	1CH	011	014	And they placed themselves in the midst of that piece [of ground], and they delivered it, and smote the Philistines: and the Lord helped [them] with a great victory.
013	1CH	011	015	And these three, the chiefs of the thirty, went down to the rock to David, to the cave of 'Adullam; and the camp of the Philistines was pitched in the valley of Rephaim.
013	1CH	011	016	And David was then in the strong-hold, and an outpost of the Philistines was then at Beth-lechem.
013	1CH	011	017	And David longed, and said, Oh that some one would bring me water to drink out of the well of Beth-lechem, which is by the gate!
013	1CH	011	018	And the three broke through the camp of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lechem, which was by the gate, and carried it, and brought it to David; but David would not drink thereof, and poured it out unto the Lord.
013	1CH	011	019	And he said, Far be it from me, before my God, that I should do this: shall I drink the blood of these men that went at the risk of their lives? for at the risk of their lives did they bring it; and thus he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men.
013	1CH	011	020	And Abshai the brother of Joab was the chief of these three; and he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain, and had a name among the three.
013	1CH	011	021	Of the three, he was more honored than the two, wherefore he became their captain; he nevertheless attained not unto the three [in prowess].
013	1CH	011	022	Banayah the son of Jehoyada', the son of a valiant man, great in many acts, of Kah-zeel: he it was that smote the two lion-like heroes of Moab; he also went down and smote a lion in the midst of a pit on a day when it snowed.
013	1CH	011	023	And he smote an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and he snatched the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.
013	1CH	011	024	These things did Benayah the son of Jehoyada'; and he had a name among the mighty men.
013	1CH	011	025	Behold, he was indeed more honored than the thirty; but he attained not to the first three. And David appointed him over his private council.
013	1CH	011	026	And the mighty men of the armies were, 'Assahel the brother of Joab, Elchanan the son of Dodo of Beth-lechem.
013	1CH	011	027	Shammoth the Harorite, Chelez the Pelonite,

013	1CH	011	042	'Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a chief of the Reubenites, and with him were thirty [men].
013	1CH	011	043	Chanan the son of Ma'achah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite.
013	1CH	011	044	'Uzziya the 'Ashterathite, Shama' and Je'iel the sons of Chothan the 'Aro'erite,

013	1CH	011	047	Eliel, and 'Obed, and Ja'assiel the Mezobayite.
013	1CH	012	001	And these are those that came to David to Ziklag, while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish: and they were among the mighty men, confederates for the war,
013	1CH	012	002	Who were armed with bows, and could use both the right and the left hand in [hurling] stones and shooting arrows with the bow, even of the brethren of Saul out of Benjamin.
013	1CH	012	003	The chiefs were Achi'ezer, then Joash, the sons of Hashema'ab the Gib'athite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of 'Azmaveth; and Berachah, and Jehu the 'Anthothite,

013	1CH	012	007	And Jo'elah, and Zebadyah, the sons of Jerocham of Gedor.
013	1CH	012	008	And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David into the strong-hold in the wilderness mighty men of valor, and men of the army for the war, that could handle shield and lance, whose faces were like the faces of lions, and were as the roebucks upon the mountains in swiftness.
013	1CH	012	009	'Ezer was the chief, 'Ohadiah the second, Eliab the third,

013	1CH	012	015	These are those that passed over the Jordan in the first month, when it had overflowed all its banks; and they put to flight all the men of the valleys, both toward the east, and toward the west.
013	1CH	012	016	And there came some of the children of Benjamin and of Judah as far as the strong-hold unto David.
013	1CH	012	017	And David went out to meet them, and commenced and said unto them. If ye be come for peace unto me, to help me, my heart shall be inclined toward you to unite with you; but if it be to betray me to my adversaries while there is no violence in my hands, then may the God of our fathers look on and decide it.
013	1CH	012	018	Then a spirit invested 'Amassai, the chief of the captains, [who said,] Thine are we, David, and with thee, O son of Jesse: peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to every one that helpeth thee; for thy God helpeth thee. Then David received them, and placed them at the head of the troop.
013	1CH	012	019	And some of Menasseh went over to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle; but he helped them not; for upon consultation did the lords of the Philistines send him away, saying, With our heads will he go over to his master Saul.
013	1CH	012	020	As he was going over to Ziklag, there went over to him of Menasseh, 'Adnach, and Jozabad, and Jedi'ael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zillethai, captains of the thousands that belonged to Menasseh.
013	1CH	012	021	And they were those that helped David against the band [of 'Amelekites]; for they were all mighty men of valor, and they became officers in the army.
013	1CH	012	022	For all the time, day by day, people used to come to David to help him, until the camp became great, like the camp of God.
013	1CH	012	023	And these are the numbers of the heads of those ready armed for the host that came to David to Hebron, to turn over the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the order of the Lord.
013	1CH	012	024	The children of Judah that bore shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred, ready armed for the host.
013	1CH	012	025	Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valor for the host, seven thousand and one hundred.
013	1CH	012	026	Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred.
013	1CH	012	027	And Jehoyada' was the leader of the family of Aaron, and with him were three thousand and seven hundred.
013	1CH	012	028	Also Zadok, a young man, mighty of valor, and his family division twenty and two chiefs.
013	1CH	012	029	And of the children of Benjamin, the brethren of Saul, three thousand; for till that time the greatest part of them had kept the charge of the house of Saul.
013	1CH	012	030	And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred, mighty men of valor, men of fame in their family divisions.
013	1CH	012	031	And of the half tribe of Menasseh eighteen thousand, who had been expressed by name, to come to make David king.
013	1CH	012	032	And of the children of Issachar, those who had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do, —their heads were two hundred; and all their brethren were ready at their order.
013	1CH	012	033	Of Zebulun, such as went forth to the host, arrayed for battle, with all manner of weapons of war, fifty thousand; and these were ready to place themselves in battle array with an undivided heart.
013	1CH	012	034	And of Naphtali one thousand captains, and with them were with shield and spear thirty and seven thousand.
013	1CH	012	035	And of the Danites arrayed for battle twenty and eight thousand and six hundred.
013	1CH	012	036	And of Asher, such as went forth to the host to put themselves in battle array, forty thousand.
013	1CH	012	037	And from the other side of the Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Menasseh, with all manner of weapons of the host for war, one hundred and twenty thousand.
013	1CH	012	038	All these men of war, that placed themselves in battle array, came with an entire heart to Hebron, to make David King over all Israel; and also all the rest of Israel were of one heart to make David king.
013	1CH	012	039	And they were there with David three days eating and drinking; for their brethren had prepared for them.
013	1CH	012	040	And also those that were nigh unto them, as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought in bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, food made of meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep in abundance; for there was joy in Israel.
013	1CH	013	001	And David consulted with the officers of the thousands and hundreds, and with every leader.
013	1CH	013	002	And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, if it seem good unto you, and if it be of the Lord our God, let us send widely about unto our brethren who are left in all the lands of Israel, and with them unto the priests and Levites who are in their cities and open districts, that they may gather themselves together unto us.
013	1CH	013	003	And let us bring round the ark of our God to us; for we have inquired not at it in the days of Saul.
013	1CH	013	004	And all the congregation said that this should be done; for the king was right in the eyes of all the people.
013	1CH	013	005	So David assembled all Israel together, from Shichor of Egypt even unto the entrance of Chemath, to bring the ark of God from Kiryath-ye'arim.
013	1CH	013	006	And David went up, with all Israel, to Ba'alah, [that is] to Kiryath-ye'arim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the Lord, that dwelleth between the cherubim, whose name is called [on it].
013	1CH	013	007	And they conveyed the ark of God in a new wagon out of the house of Abinadab: and 'Uzza and Achyo guided the wagon.
013	1CH	013	008	And David and all Israel played before God with all their might, and with singing, and on harps, and on psalteries, and on tambourines, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.
013	1CH	013	009	And when they came as far as the threshing-floor of Kidon, 'Uzza put forth his hand to take hold of the ark; for the oxen shook it.
013	1CH	013	010	And the anger of the Lord was kindled against 'Uzza, and he smote him, because he had put forth his hand toward the ark: and he died there before God.
013	1CH	013	011	And it was grievious to David, because the Lord had suddenly taken away 'Uzza; and he called that place Perez-'uzza [Breach of 'Uzza] until this day.
013	1CH	013	012	And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring home to me the ark of God?
013	1CH	013	013	So David removed not the ark unto himself into the city of David, but had it carried round into the house of 'Obed-edom the Gittite.
013	1CH	013	014	And the ark of God remained in the house of 'Obed-edom, in his house, three months. And the Lord blessed the house of 'Obed-edom, and all that belonged to him.
013	1CH	014	001	And Churam the king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and trees of cedars, and masons and carpenters, to build him a house.
013	1CH	014	002	And David felt conscious that the Lord had established him as king over Israel; for his kingdom was exalted on high, because of his people Israel.
013	1CH	014	003	And David took yet more wives at Jerusalem; and David begat more sons and daughters.
013	1CH	014	004	And these are the names of the children that he had in Jerusalem: Shammua', and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,
013	1CH	014	005	And Yibchar, and Elishua', and Elpalet,
013	1CH	014	006	And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Yaphia',
013	1CH	014	007	And Elishama', and Be'elyada', and Eliphalet.
013	1CH	014	008	But when the Philistines heard that David had been anointed as king over all Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David: and David heard of it, and went out against them.
013	1CH	014	009	And the Philistines came and spread themselves out in the valley of Rephaim.
013	1CH	014	010	And David asked counsel of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And the Lord said unto him, Go up; and I will deliver them into thy hand.
013	1CH	014	011	And they came up to Ba'al-perazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken down my enemies through my hand as a breach [is made] by water: therefore they called the name of that place Ba'al-perazim.
013	1CH	014	012	And they left behind there their gods, and David gave the order, and they were burnt with fire.
013	1CH	014	013	And the Philistines [came] once again, and spread themselves out in the valley.
013	1CH	014	014	And David asked again counsel of God; and God said unto him, Thou shalt not go up after them: turn about from them, and come upon them opposite the mulberry-trees,
013	1CH	014	015	And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of walking on the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle; for God will be gone forth before thee to smite the camp of the Philistines.
013	1CH	014	016	And David did as God had commanded him; and they smote the camp of the Philistines from Gib'on as far as Gezer.
013	1CH	014	017	And the fame of David went out into all the lands; and the Lord laid the dread of him upon all the nations.
013	1CH	015	001	And [David] made himself houses in the city of David, and he prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.
013	1CH	015	002	Then said David, None shall carry the ark of God but the Levites; for of them hath the Lord made choice to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever.
013	1CH	015	003	And David assembled all Israel to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the Lord unto its place, which he had prepared for it.
013	1CH	015	004	And David gathered together the children of Aaron, and the Levites.
013	1CH	015	005	Of the sons of Kehath: Uriel the chief, and his brethren one hundred and twenty.
013	1CH	015	006	Of the sons of Merari: 'Assayah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty.
013	1CH	015	007	Of the sons of Gershom: Joel the chief, and his brethren one hundred and thirty.
013	1CH	015	008	Of the sons of Elizaphan: Shema'yah the chief, and his brethren two hundred.
013	1CH	015	009	Of the sons of Hebron: Eliel the chief, and his brethren eighty.
013	1CH	015	010	Of the sons of 'Uzziel: 'Amminadab the chief, and his brethren one hundred and twelve.
013	1CH	015	011	And David called for Zadok and Ebyathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, 'Assayah, and Joel, Shema'yah, and Eliel, and 'Amminadab,
013	1CH	015	012	And he said unto them, Ye are the chiefs of the family divisions of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, ye and your brethren, and bring up the ark of the Lord the God of Israel unto [the place which] I have prepared for it.
013	1CH	015	013	For, because ye [did] it not at the first, the Lord our God made a breach among us; because we had not sought him after the prescribed manner.
013	1CH	015	014	So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the Lord the God of Israel.
013	1CH	015	015	And the children of the Levites bore the ark of God, as Moses had commanded according to the word of the Lord, on their shoulders, by means of barrows placed upon them.
013	1CH	015	016	And David said to the chiefs of the Levites to appoint their brethren the singers with instruments of music, psalteries and harps and cymbals, to sing aloud, by lifting up the voice for joy.
013	1CH	015	017	So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel, and of his brethren, Assaph the son of Berechyahu, and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushayahu;
013	1CH	015	018	And with them their brethren of the second degree, Zecharyahu, Ben, and Ja'aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jechiel, and 'Unni, Eliab, and Benayahu, and Ma'asseyahu, and Matthithyahu, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneyahu, and 'Obed-edom, and Je'iel, the gatekeepers.
013	1CH	015	019	Namely, the singers, Heman, Assaph, and Ethan, to play aloud with cymbals of copper;
013	1CH	015	020	And Zechariah, and 'Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jechiel, and 'Unni, and Eliab, and Ma'asseyahu, and Benayahu, with psalteries on 'Alamoth;
013	1CH	015	021	And Matthithyahu, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneyahu, and 'Obed-edom, and Je-iel, and 'Azazyahu, with harps on the Sheminith to play as leaders.
013	1CH	015	022	And Kenanyahu was the chief of the Levites in conducting the singing: he instructed in conducting the singing, because he was skilful.
013	1CH	015	023	And Berechyah and Elkanah were gatekeepers for the ark.
013	1CH	015	024	And Shebanyahu, and Joshaphat, and Nethanel, and 'Amassai, and Zecharyahu, and Benayahu, and Eli'ezer, the priests, did blow on the trumpets before the ark of God; and 'Obed-edom and Jechiyah were gatekeepers for the ark.
013	1CH	015	025	And it was David, with the elders of Israel, and the officers over the thousands, who went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the house of 'Obed-edom with joy.
013	1CH	015	026	And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams.
013	1CH	015	027	And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and [so were] all the Levites that carried the ark, and the singers, and Kenanyahu the chief in conducting the singing of the singers; but David had also upon him an ephod of linen.
013	1CH	015	028	Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the Lord with shouting, and with the sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, playing aloud on psalteries and harps.
013	1CH	015	029	And it happened, as the ark of the covenant of the Lord came as far as the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked through the window, and saw king David dancing and playing, and she despised him in her heart.
013	1CH	016	001	And they brought in the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it; and they offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before God.
013	1CH	016	002	And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offerings and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord.
013	1CH	016	003	And he dealt out to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine.
013	1CH	016	004	And he placed before the ark of the Lord several of the Levites as ministers, and to chaunt hymns, and to give praise and thanks unto the Lord the God of Israel:
013	1CH	016	005	Assaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah; Je'iel, and Shemiramoth, and Jechiel, and Matthithyah, and Eliab, and Benayahu, and 'Obed-edom; and Je'iel with psalteries and with harps; but Assaph played aloud with the cymbals.
013	1CH	016	006	And Benayahu and Jachaziel the priests were with the trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.
013	1CH	016	007	On that day—then did David appoint for the first time to give thanks to the Lord through means of Assaph and his brethren.
013	1CH	016	008	O give thanks unto the Lord; call on his name; make known among the people his deeds.
013	1CH	016	009	Sing unto him, sing praises unto him: speak of all his wonderful works.
013	1CH	016	010	Glorify yourselves in his holy name: let the heart of those rejoice that seek the Lord.
013	1CH	016	011	Inquire after the Lord and his strength: seek his presence evermore.
013	1CH	016	012	Remember his wonderful works which he hath done, his tokens, and the decrees of his mouth;
013	1CH	016	013	O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his elect.
013	1CH	016	014	He is the Lord our God: over all the earth are his decrees.
013	1CH	016	015	Remember ye for ever his covenant, the word which he hath commanded to the thousandth generation.
013	1CH	016	016	Which he covenanted with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;
013	1CH	016	017	And which he established unto Jacob as a statute, unto Israel as an everlasting covenant;
013	1CH	016	018	Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, as the portion of your inheritance;
013	1CH	016	019	When ye were but few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.
013	1CH	016	020	And when they wandered from one nation to another, and from one kingdom to another people:
013	1CH	016	021	He suffered no man to oppress them; yea, he reproved kings for their sake.
013	1CH	016	022	Saying, “Touch not my anointed, and do my prophets no harm.”—
013	1CH	016	023	Sing unto the Lord all ye lands: announce from day to day his salvation.
013	1CH	016	024	Relate among the nations his glory: among all the people his wonderful deeds.
013	1CH	016	025	For great is the Lord, and greatly praised; and he is to be feared above all gods.
013	1CH	016	026	For all the gods of the people are idols: but the Lord hath made the heavens.
013	1CH	016	027	Majesty and honor are in his presence, strength and gladness are in his place.
013	1CH	016	028	Ascribe unto the Lord, O ye families of people, ascribe unto the Lord glory and strength.
013	1CH	016	029	Ascribe unto the Lord the glory due unto his name; take up an offering, and come into his presence; bow down before the Lord in the beauty of holiness.
013	1CH	016	030	Tremble before him, all ye lands! Also the world standeth firmly, that it be not moved.
013	1CH	016	031	Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; and let men say among the nations, The Lord reigneth.
013	1CH	016	032	Let the sea roar, with all that filleth it: let the fields rejoice, and all that is therein.
013	1CH	016	033	Then shall the trees of the forest sing joyfully at the presence of the Lord; because he cometh to judge the earth.
013	1CH	016	034	O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good; because unto everlasting endureth his kindness.
013	1CH	016	035	And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the nations, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, to glorify ourselves in thy praise.
013	1CH	016	036	Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel from everlasting even unto everlasting. And all the people said, Amen, and praise unto the Lord.
013	1CH	016	037	And he left there in charge before the ark of the covenant of the Lord Assaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, at the work of every day on its day,
013	1CH	016	038	And 'Obed-edom with their brethren, sixty and eight, and 'Obed-edom the son of Jeduthun and Chossah to be gatekeepers;
013	1CH	016	039	And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the Lord, in the high-place that was at Gib'on,
013	1CH	016	040	To offer burnt-offerings unto the Lord upon the altar of the burnt-offering continually at morning and at evening, and this in accordance with all that is written in the law of the Lord which he had commanded concerning Israel;
013	1CH	016	041	And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were selected who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the Lord, because unto everlasting endureth his kindness;
013	1CH	016	042	And with them, with Heman and Jeduthun, the trumpets and cymbals to play aloud, and the musical instruments of God; and the sons of Jeduthun to be for the service at the gate.
013	1CH	016	043	And all the people went every man to his house; and David turned about to bless his house.
013	1CH	017	001	And it came to pass, when David dwelt in his house, that David said unto Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in a house of cedar, while the ark of the covenant of the Lord is under curtains.
013	1CH	017	002	And Nathan said unto David, All that is in thy heart do; for God is with thee.
013	1CH	017	003	And it came to pass during that night, that the word of God came unto Nathan, saying,
013	1CH	017	004	Go and say unto David my servant, Thus hath said the Lord, Not thou shalt build for me the house to dwell in;
013	1CH	017	005	For I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel even until this day; but have been [moving] from tent to tent, and from [one] tabernacle [to another].
013	1CH	017	006	In all the places where I moved about among all Israel, did I speak a word to any one of the judges of Israel, whom I had ordained to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built for me a house of cedar?
013	1CH	017	007	Now therefore, thus shalt thou say unto my servant, to David, Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, I took thee away from the sheepcote, from behind the flocks, to be a ruler over my people Israel;
013	1CH	017	008	And I have been with thee withersoever thou didst go, and I have cut off all thy enemies from thy presence, and I have made thee a name; like the name of the great men who are on the earth;
013	1CH	017	009	And I have procured a place for my people Israel, and I have planted them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and be no more troubled; and that the children of wickedness shall not waste them any more, as aforetimes,
013	1CH	017	010	And [as it was] since the time that I ordained judges to be over my people Israel; and I have humbled all thy enemies; and now I tell thee that the Lord will build for thee a house.
013	1CH	017	011	And it shall come to pass, that, when thy days will be completed that thou must go [to sleep] with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, who shall be of thy sons, and I will establish his kingdom.
013	1CH	017	012	He it is that shall build for me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever.
013	1CH	017	013	I too will be to him as a father, and he shall indeed be unto me as a son: and my kindness will I not cause to depart from him, as I caused it to depart from him that was before thee;
013	1CH	017	014	But I will place him firmly in my house and in my kingdom for evermore; and his throne shall be established for ever.
013	1CH	017	015	In accordance with all these words, and in accordance with all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.
013	1CH	017	016	Then went king David in and sat down before the Lord, and he said, Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me as far as hitherward?
013	1CH	017	017	And this was [yet] too small a thing in thy eyes, O God, and thou hast spoken concerning thy servant's house for a distant time, and hast regarded me as though I belonged to the rank of a man of high degree, O Lord God.
013	1CH	017	018	What can David add yet more [to speak] unto thee of the honor of thy servant? since thou knowest well thy servant.
013	1CH	017	019	O Lord, for the sake of thy servant, and in accordance with thy own heart, hast thou done all this great thing, to make known all these great things.
013	1CH	017	020	O Lord, there is none like thee, and there is no god beside thee, in accordance with all that we have heard with our ears.
013	1CH	017	021	And who is like thy people Israel, the only nation on the earth which God went to redeem for himself as a people, to acquire for thyself a name for great and terrible deeds, by driving out nations from before thy people, which thou hadst redeemed out of Egypt?
013	1CH	017	022	And thou hast instituted thy people Israel unto thyself as a people for ever; and thou, Lord, art indeed become their God.
013	1CH	017	023	And now, O Lord, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be verified for ever, and do as thou hast spoken.
013	1CH	017	024	Yea, let it be verified, and let thy name be magnified unto everlasting, that men may say, The Lord of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God for Israel; and may the house of David thy servant be established before thee.
013	1CH	017	025	For thou, O my God, hast revealed to the ear of thy servant, that thou wilt build for him a house; therefore hath thy servant found himself able to pray before thee.
013	1CH	017	026	And now, O Lord, thou art the [true] God, and thou hast spoken concerning thy servant this goodness:
013	1CH	017	027	And now hast thou been pleased to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee; for thou, O Lord, hast blessed, and [it will remain] blessed for ever.
013	1CH	018	001	And it came to pass after this, that David smote the Philistines, and humbled them; and he took Gath and its dependent towns out of the hand of the Philistines.
013	1CH	018	002	And he smote Moab, and the Moabites became David's servants, bringing presents.
013	1CH	018	003	David also smote Hadar'ezer the king of Zobah, at Chamath, as he went to establish his dominion at the river Euphrates.
013	1CH	018	004	And David captured from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand men on foot; and David hamstringed all the chariot-teams, but reserved of them a hundred chariot-teams.
013	1CH	018	005	And the Syrians of Damascus came to aid Hadar'ezer the king of Zobah, when David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.
013	1CH	018	006	Then did David put [garrisons] in Syria of Damascus, and the Syrians became unto David servants, bringing presents. And the Lord helped David withersoever he went.
013	1CH	018	007	And David took the quivers of gold that were on the servants of Hadar'ezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
013	1CH	018	008	And from Tibchath, and from Kun, cities of Hadar'ezer, did David take exceedingly much copper; thereof made Solomon the copper sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of copper.
013	1CH	018	009	And when To'u the king of Chamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadar'ezer the king of Zobah:
013	1CH	018	010	Then did he send Hadoram his son unto king David, to ask him after his well-being, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadar'ezer, and smitten him: for Hadar'ezer had been engaged in wars with To'u; and [he had with him] all manner of vessels of gold and silver and copper.
013	1CH	018	011	Also these did king David sanctify unto the Lord, with the silver and the gold that he had carried away from all the nations, from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of 'Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from 'Amalek.
013	1CH	018	012	And Abshai the son of Zeruyah smote of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand [men].
013	1CH	018	013	And he put garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became servants unto David. And the Lord helped David withersoever he went.
013	1CH	018	014	And David reigned over all Israel, and he did what is just and right unto all his people.
013	1CH	018	015	And Joab the son of Zeruyah was over the army, and Jehoshaphat the son of Achilud, recorder.
013	1CH	018	016	And Zadok the son of Achitub, and Abimelech the son of Ebyathar, were [the] priests; and Shavsha was scribe;
013	1CH	018	017	And Benayahu the son of Jehoyada' was over the Kerethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were the first at the side of the king.
013	1CH	019	001	And it came to pass after this, that Nachash the king of the children of 'Ammon died, and his son became king in his stead.
013	1CH	019	002	And David said, I will show kindness unto Chanun the son of Nachash, because his father showed kindness unto me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. And the servants of David came unto the land of the children of 'Ammon to Chanun, to comfort him.
013	1CH	019	003	And the princes of the children of 'Ammon said unto Chanun, Doth David honor thy father in thy eyes, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee in order to search out, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?
013	1CH	019	004	Chanun thereupon took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle as far as the hip-bone, and sent them away.
013	1CH	019	005	And some people went and told David concerning these men. And he sent [persons] to meet them: because the men were greatly ashamed; and the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beard be grown, and then return.
013	1CH	019	006	And when the children of 'Ammon saw that they were become in bad odor with David, Chanun and the children of 'Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire for themselves from Mesopotamia, and from Syria-ma'achah, and from Zobah, chariots and horsemen.
013	1CH	019	007	And they hired for themselves thirty and two thousand [warriors in] chariots, and the king of Ma'achah and his people: and they came and encamped before Medeba. And the children of 'Ammon gathered themselves together out of their cities, and came to the battle.
013	1CH	019	008	And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the army [and] the mighty men.
013	1CH	019	009	And the children of 'Ammon came out, and put themselves in battle array at the entrance of the city: and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field.
013	1CH	019	010	When now Joab saw that the front of battle was against him before and behind, he made a selection from all the chosen men of Israel, and arrayed himself against the Syrians.
013	1CH	019	011	And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abshai his brother, and they arrayed themselves against the children of 'Ammon.
013	1CH	019	012	And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then shalt thou bring me help; but if the children of 'Ammon be too strong for thee, then will I help thee.
013	1CH	019	013	Be strong, and let us strengthen ourselves in behalf of our people, and in behalf of the cities of our God, and may the Lord do that which seemeth good in his eyes.
013	1CH	019	014	And Joab drew nigh and the people that were with him in front of the Syrians unto the battle, and they fled from before him.
013	1CH	019	015	And when the children of 'Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, then did they also fly before Abshai his brother, and entered into the city. And Joab went back to Jerusalem.
013	1CH	019	016	And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel, they sent messengers, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the army of Hadar'ezer went before them.
013	1CH	019	017	And when it was told to David, he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came up with them, and arrayed himself against them. So when David had arrayed himself against the Syrians [for] battle, they fought with him.
013	1CH	019	018	And the Syrians fled from before Israel: and David slew of the Syrians [the men of] seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand men on foot, and Shophach the captain of the army he put to death.
013	1CH	019	019	And when the vassals of Hadar'ezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with David, and served him: and the Syrians would not help the children of 'Ammon any more.
013	1CH	020	001	And it came to pass, at the time of the return of the same season of the year, at the time when kings go forth, that Joab led out the power of the army, and destroyed the country of the children of 'Ammon, and he came and besieged Rabbah. But David remained behind at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and pulled it down.
013	1CH	020	002	And David took the crown of Malkam from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and thereon a precious stone; and it was set on the head of David: and the booty of the city he brought out in great abundance.
013	1CH	020	003	And the people that were therein he brought forward, and cut them with saws, and with iron threshing-wagons, and with axes; and thus did David unto all the cities of the children of 'Ammon; and David returned then with all the people unto Jerusalem.
013	1CH	020	004	And it came to pass after this, that there arose a battle at Gezer with the Philistines: then smote Sibbechai the Chushathite Sippai, one of the children of the Rapha; and they were humbled.
013	1CH	020	005	And there was again a battle with the Philistines, when Elchanan the son of Yair smote Lachmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.
013	1CH	020	006	And there was again a battle at Gath, where was a man of [great] stature, whose fingers and toes were six on each [hand and foot], four and twenty [in all]; and he also was born to the Rapha.
013	1CH	020	007	And he defied Israel; but Jonathan the son of Shim'a the brother of David smote him.
013	1CH	020	008	These were born unto the Rapha in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
013	1CH	021	001	And the Accuser stood up against Israel, and incited David to count Israel.
013	1CH	021	002	And David said to Joab, and to the princes of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba' even to Dan, and bring their number to me, that I may know it.
013	1CH	021	003	Then said Joab, May the Lord add unto his people, how many soever they be, a hundred-fold more: are they not all, my lord the king, my lord's servants? why then will my lord require this thing? why shall it be a cause of guiltiness for Israel?
013	1CH	021	004	Nevertheless the king's word remained firm against Joab; and Joab went out, and moved about throughout all Israel, and came [back] to Jerusalem.
013	1CH	021	005	And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto David: and there were [in] all Israel a thousand times thousand and one hundred thousand men that drew the sword: and [of] Judah were four hundred and seventy thousand men that drew the sword.
013	1CH	021	006	But Levi and Benjamin did he not count among them: for the king's word was abominable to Joab.
013	1CH	021	007	And this thing was displeasing in the eyes of God, and he smote Israel.
013	1CH	021	008	And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing; but now, I beseech thee, cause the iniquity of thy servant to pass away; for I have acted very foolishly.
013	1CH	021	009	And the Lord spoke unto Gad, David's seer, saying,
013	1CH	021	010	Go and speak unto David, saying, Thus hath said the Lord, Three things do I offer thee: choose for thyself one of them, and I will do it unto thee.
013	1CH	021	011	So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus hath said the Lord, Select for thyself,
013	1CH	021	012	Whether there shall be three years famine; or three months, to be destroyed before thy adversaries, so that the sword of thy enemies overtake thee; or that during three days the sword of the Lord, even the pestilence, shall be in the land, and an angel of the Lord destroying throughout all the boundaries of Israel? And now reflect what word I shall bring back to him that hath sent me.
013	1CH	021	013	And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall then into the hand of the Lord; for his mercies are very great; but let me not fall into the hand of man.
013	1CH	021	014	So the Lord sent a pestilence in Israel, and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.
013	1CH	021	015	And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it; but as he was destroying, the Lord looked on, and he bethought himself of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough: now stay thy hand. And the angel of the Lord was standing by the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
013	1CH	021	016	And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the Lord standing between the earth and the heavens, with his sword drawn in his hand, stretched out over Jerusalem. Then fell David, with the elders wrapt in sackcloth, upon their faces.
013	1CH	021	017	And David said unto God, Was it not I that ordered to count the people? and I am the one that have sinned and have done evil indeed; but these sheep, what have they done? O Lord my God, let thy hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's house, but not against thy people, that there should be a plague.
013	1CH	021	018	And the angel of the Lord spoke to Gad to say to David, that David should go up, to erect an altar unto the Lord on the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
013	1CH	021	019	And David went up by the word of Gad, which he had spoken in the name of the Lord.
013	1CH	021	020	And when Ornan turned back, and saw the angel, then did he and his four sons with him hide themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.
013	1CH	021	021	And as David came up to Ornan, Ornan looked up and saw David; and he went out of the threshing-floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.
013	1CH	021	022	Then said David to Ornan, “Grant me the site of this threshing-floor, that I may build thereon an altar unto the Lord: for the full price shalt thou give it unto me, so that the plague may be stayed from the people.”
013	1CH	021	023	And Ornan said unto David, Take it for thyself, and let my lord the king do what is good in his eyes: lo, I give the oxen for burnt-offerings, and the threshing-rollers for wood, and the wheat for the meat-offering; the whole do I give [thee].
013	1CH	021	024	And king David said to Ornan, No: but I will surely buy it at the full value; for I will not take what is thine for the Lord, so as to offer burnt-offerings without paying therefore.
013	1CH	021	025	So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.
013	1CH	021	026	And David built there an altar unto the Lord, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and he called on the Lord: and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt-offering.
013	1CH	021	027	And the Lord spoke to the angel, and he put back his sword into its sheath.
013	1CH	021	028	At that time when David saw that the Lord had answered him on the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then did he sacrifice there.
013	1CH	021	029	But the tabernacle of the Lord, which Moses had made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt-offering, were at that time in the high-place at Gib'on.
013	1CH	021	030	But David was not able to go before it to inquire of God; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the Lord.
013	1CH	022	001	And David said, This is the house of the Lord the [true] God, and this is the altar for the burnt-offering for Israel.
013	1CH	022	002	And David ordered to gather together the strangers that were in the land of Israel: and he appointed [them] to be masons to hew cut stones to build the house of God.
013	1CH	022	003	And iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings, did David prepare; and copper in abundance, [which] could not be weighed;
013	1CH	022	004	Also cedar-trees [which] could not be counted; for the Zidonians and the Tyrians had brought cedar-trees in abundance to David.
013	1CH	022	005	And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be built [in honor] of the Lord must be exceedingly great, for fame and for glory throughout all the countries: I will therefore make preparation for it. So David made abundant preparation before his death.
013	1CH	022	006	And he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build a house for the Lord the God of Israel.
013	1CH	022	007	And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build a house unto the name of the Lord my God;
013	1CH	022	008	But there came concerning me the word of the Lord, saying, Blood in abundance hast thou shed, and great wars hast thou made: thou shalt not build a house unto my name, because much blood hast thou shed upon the earth before me.
013	1CH	022	009	Behold, a son will be born to thee, he it is who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies on every side; for Solomon [The Peaceful] shall be his name, and peace and quietness will I bestow on Israel in his days.
013	1CH	022	010	He it is who shall build a house unto my name; and he shall be unto me as a son, and I will be unto him as a father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.
013	1CH	022	011	Now, my son, may the Lord be with thee, that thou mayest prosper, and build the house of the Lord thy God, as he hath spoken concerning thee.
013	1CH	022	012	Only may the Lord give thee intelligence and understanding, and give thee charge over Israel, so that thou mayest observe the law of the Lord thy God.
013	1CH	022	013	Then wilt thou prosper, if thou observe to practise the statutes and the ordinances which the Lord commanded Moses concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; be not afraid, nor be thou dismayed.
013	1CH	022	014	And, behold, during my affliction have I prepared for the house of the Lord one hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand times thousand talents of silver; and of copper and iron [as much as] cannot be weighed; for in [such] abundance was it: and wood and stone have I prepared; and thou must add thereto.
013	1CH	022	015	Moreover there are with thee in abundance workmen, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of skilful men for every kind of work.
013	1CH	022	016	The gold, the silver, and the copper, and the iron cannot be numbered: arise, [therefore,] and be doing, and may the Lord be with thee.
013	1CH	022	017	And David gave a charge to all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, [saying,]
013	1CH	022	018	Behold the Lord your God is with you; and he hath given you rest on every side; for he hath given up into my hand the inhabitants of the land, and the land is subdued before the Lord, and before his people.
013	1CH	022	019	Now direct your heart and your soul to seek the Lord your God; and arise, and build ye the sanctuary of the Lord the [true] God, [in order] to bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built unto the name of the Lord.
013	1CH	023	001	And when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel.
013	1CH	023	002	And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.
013	1CH	023	003	And then were numbered the Levites from thirty years old and upward: and their number by their polls, of men, was thirty and eight thousand.
013	1CH	023	004	Of these were twenty and four thousand to superintend the work of the house of the Lord; and six thousand were officers and judges;
013	1CH	023	005	And four thousand were gatekeepers: and four thousand those who praised the Lord with the instruments which I have made, to praise therewith.
013	1CH	023	006	And David divided them into divisions after the sons of Levi, after Gershon, Kehath, and Merari.
013	1CH	023	007	Of the Gershunites: La'dan, and Shim'i.
013	1CH	023	008	The sons of La'dan: The chief was Jechiel, and Zetham, and Joel, three.
013	1CH	023	009	The sons of Shim'i: Shelomith, and Chaziel, and Haran, three. These were the chiefs of the families of La'dan.
013	1CH	023	010	And the sons of Shim'i were, Jachath, Zina, and Je'ush, and Beri'ah. These four were the sons of Shim'i.
013	1CH	023	011	And Jachath was the chief, and Zizah the second; but Je'ush and Beri'ah had not many sons: therefore were they accounted as one family division in the numbering.
013	1CH	023	012	The sons of Kehath: 'Amram, Yizhar, Hebron, and 'Uzziel, four.
013	1CH	023	013	The sons of 'Amram, Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was set apart, to sanctify him as most holy, he with his sons for ever, to burn incense before the Lord, to minister unto him, and to bless in his name for ever.
013	1CH	023	014	But as regardeth Moses the man of God, his sons were named after the tribe of Levi.
013	1CH	023	015	The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eli'ezer.
013	1CH	023	016	Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief.
013	1CH	023	017	And the sons of Eli'ezer were, Rechahyah the chief. And Eli'ezer had no other sons; but the sons of Rechahyah became exceedingly numerous.
013	1CH	023	018	Of the sons of Yizhar, was Shelomith the chief.
013	1CH	023	019	The sons of Hebron: Jeriyahu the chief, Amaryah the second, Jachaziel the third, and Jekam'am the fourth.
013	1CH	023	020	The sons of 'Uzziel: Michah the chief, and Yishiyah the second.
013	1CH	023	021	The sons of Merari: Machli, and Mushi. The sons of Machli: El'azar, and Kish.
013	1CH	023	022	And El'azar died, and had no sons, but daughters; and the sons of Kish, their brethren, took them [for wives].
013	1CH	023	023	The sons of Mushi: Machli, and 'Eder, and Jeremoth, three.
013	1CH	023	024	These were the sons of Levi after their family divisions, even the chiefs of the families, as they were counted by numbering the names after their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the Lord, from twenty years old and upward.
013	1CH	023	025	For David said, The Lord the God of Israel hath given rest unto his people, and he dwelleth in Jerusalem for evermore.
013	1CH	023	026	And also the Levites are no more bound to carry the tabernacle, and all its vessels for the service thereof.
013	1CH	023	027	Therefore by the last words of David were there numbered of the Levites those who were from twenty years old and above;
013	1CH	023	028	Because their station was to be at the side of the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the Lord, in the courts, and in the chambers, and by the purification of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God;
013	1CH	023	029	And for the shew-bread, which was put in rows, and for the fine flour for meat-offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for that which is baked in the pan, and for that which is sodden, and for all manner of dry and wet measure;
013	1CH	023	030	And to stand every morning to thank and praise the Lord, and so also at evening,
013	1CH	023	031	And at all the offering of burnt-offerings unto the Lord on the sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the appointed feasts, according to the number, and after the manner prescribed for them, continually before the Lord;
013	1CH	023	032	And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of the Lord.
013	1CH	024	001	And the divisions of the sons of Aaron were: The sons of Aaron were Nadab, and Abihu, El'azar, and Ithamar.
013	1CH	024	002	But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and they had no children: and El'azar and Ithamar became priests.
013	1CH	024	003	And David divided them off with Zadok of the sons of El'azar', and Achimelech of the sons of Ithamar, to their office in their service.
013	1CH	024	004	And the sons of El'azar were found more numerous in the chiefs of males than the sons of Ithamar; and they divided them accordingly. Of the sons of El'azar there were sixteen chiefs of the family divisions, and of the sons of Ithamar, eight for their family divisions.
013	1CH	024	005	And they divided them off by lot, both the first and the last; for the governors of the sanctuary, and governors [of the house] of God, were from the sons of El'azar, and from the sons of Ithamar.
013	1CH	024	006	And Shema'yah the son of Nethanel the scribe, one of the Levites, wrote them down before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Achimelech the son of Ebyathar, and the chiefs of the families of the priests and Levites: one family division being drawn of El'azar, and one being equally drawn of Ithamar.
013	1CH	024	007	And there came out the first lot for Jehoyarib, for Jeda'yah the second,
013	1CH	024	008	For Charim the third, for Se'orim the fourth,
013	1CH	024	009	For Malkiyah the fifth, for Miyamin the sixth.
013	1CH	024	010	For Hakkoz the seventh, for Abiyah the eighth,
013	1CH	024	011	For Jeshua' the ninth, for Shechanyahu the tenth,
013	1CH	024	012	For Elyashib the eleventh, for Jakim the twelfth,
013	1CH	024	013	For Chuppah the thirteenth, for Jeshehah the fourteenth,
013	1CH	024	014	For Bilgah the fifteenth, for Immer the sixteenth,
013	1CH	024	015	For Chezir the seventeenth, for Happizzez the eighteenth,
013	1CH	024	016	For Pethachyah the nineteenth, for Ezekiel the twentieth.
013	1CH	024	017	For Jachin the one and twentieth, for Gamul the two and twentieth,
013	1CH	024	018	For Delayahu the three and twentieth, for Ma'azyahu the four and twentieth.
013	1CH	024	019	This was their office in their service to come into the house of the Lord, according to the manner prescribed to them, under the supervision of Aaron their father, as the Lord the God of Israel had commanded him.
013	1CH	024	020	And of the rest of the sons of Levi there were, of the sons of 'Amram: Shubael. Of the sons of Shubael: Jechdeyahu.
013	1CH	024	021	Concerning Rechabyahu, of the sons of Rechabyahu the chief was Yishiyah.
013	1CH	024	022	Of the Yisharites was Shelomoth: of the sons of Shelomoth was Jachath.
013	1CH	024	023	And the sons [of Hebron]: Jeriyah, Amaryahu the second, Jachaziel the third, Jekam'am the fourth.
013	1CH	024	024	[Of] the sons of 'Uzziel, Michah: of the sons of Michah, Shamir.
013	1CH	024	025	The brother of Michah was Yishiyah; of the sons of Yishiyah, Zecharyahu.
013	1CH	024	026	The sons of Merari were Machli and Mushi: the sons of Ja'aziyahu, Beno.
013	1CH	024	027	The sons of Merari by Ja'aziyahu: Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur, and 'Ibri.
013	1CH	024	028	Of Machli: El'azar, who had no sons.
013	1CH	024	029	Of Kish: The son of Kish was Jerachmeel.
013	1CH	024	030	And the sons of Mushi were Machli, and 'Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites after their family divisions.
013	1CH	024	031	These likewise cast lots in the same manner as their brethren the sons of Aaron in the presence of king David, and Zadok, and Achimelech, and the chiefs of the families of the priests and Levites, even the principal of the families equally with his youngest brother.

013	1CH	028	002	Then arose king David upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people! I had in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and for the footstool of our God, and I had made preparations to build;
013	1CH	028	003	But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build a house unto my name; because thou art a man of war, and blood hast thou shed.
013	1CH	028	004	Yet the Lord the God of Israel made choice of me out of all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever; for of Judah had he made choice as ruler, and among the house of Judah, of the house of my father; and among the sons of my father had he pleasure in me to make [me] king over all Israel:
013	1CH	028	005	And of all my sons, —for the Lord hath given me many sons, — hath he made choice of Solomon my son, to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel.
013	1CH	028	006	And he hath said unto me, Solomon thy son it is that shall build my house and my courts; for I have made choice of him to be as a son unto me, and I will be indeed to him as a father.
013	1CH	028	007	Moreover, I will firmly establish his kingdom for everlasting, if he be strong to execute my commandments and my ordinances as it is this day.
013	1CH	028	008	And now before the eyes of all Israel, the congregation of the Lord, and in the hearing of our God, [I admonish you] observe and seek for all the commandments of the Lord your God: in order that ye may keep possession of this good land, and leave it for an inheritance unto your children after you forever.
013	1CH	028	009	And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with an entire heart and with a willing soul; for all hearts doth the Lord search, and every imagination of the thoughts doth he understand; if thou seek him, he will let himself be found by thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.
013	1CH	028	010	See now that the Lord hath made choice of thee to build a house for the sanctuary: be strong and do it.
013	1CH	028	011	Then gave David to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of its apartments, and of its treasuries, and of upper chambers, and of its inner chambers, and of the place of the cover of the ark.
013	1CH	028	012	And the pattern of all that he had in his spirit, concerning the courts of the house of the Lord, and concerning all the chambers round about, concerning the treasuries of the house of God, and concerning the treasuries of the holy things:
013	1CH	028	013	Also concerning the divisions of the priests and the Levites, and concerning all the work of the service of the house of the Lord, and concerning all the vessels of service of the house of the Lord;
013	1CH	028	014	Concerning the golden vessels, after the weight of the gold, for all the vessels of all manner of service; concerning all the vessels of silver after the weight, for all the vessels of every kind of service;
013	1CH	028	015	Also the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their lamps of gold, after the weight for every candlestick, and for its lamps; and concerning the candlesticks of silver after the weight, for the candlestick, and for its lamps, according to the use of every candlestick;
013	1CH	028	016	And the gold after the weight for the tables of the rows of shewbread, for every table; and the silver for the tables of silver;
013	1CH	028	017	Also [concerning] the forks, and the bowls, and the supporters of pure gold; and concerning the golden cups after the weight for every cup; and concerning the silver cups after the weight for every cup;
013	1CH	028	018	And concerning the altar of incense the refined gold after the weight; and concerning the pattern of the chariot of the golden cherubim, which spread out [their wings], and over the ark of the covenant of the Lord.
013	1CH	028	019	All [this, said David,] was put in writing from the hand of the Lord, who gave me instruction [respecting] all the works of the pattern.
013	1CH	028	020	And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong, and of good courage, and do [the work]; fear not, and be not dismayed; for the Lord God, [yea,] my God is with thee: he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until thou have finished all the work for the service of the house of the Lord.
013	1CH	028	021	And, behold, the divisions of the priests and the Levites are there for all the service of the house of God; and with thee are in all manner of workmanship all kinds of men distinguished in wisdom, for every manner of service; and the princes and all the people are ready [to obey] all thy words.
013	1CH	029	001	And king David said unto all the assembly, Solomon, the only son of mine whom God hath made choice of, is yet young and tender, and the work is great; because not for man is the palace to be, but for the Lord God.
013	1CH	029	002	But with all my might have I made ready for the house of my God, the gold for the things of gold, and the silver for the things of silver, and the copper for the things of copper, the iron for the things of iron, and the wood for the things of wood, onyx stones, and stones to be set, bright stones, and stones of divers colors, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.
013	1CH	029	003	Moreover, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, have I acquired as my own property gold and silver; [and this] have I given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house:
013	1CH	029	004	Three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses;
013	1CH	029	005	All that is needed of gold and of silver, and for every manner of work [to be made] by the hands of artificers. And who [now] is willing to consecrate his hand this day unto the Lord?
013	1CH	029	006	Thereupon offered voluntarily the chiefs of the family divisions and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of the thousands and of the hundreds, with the supervisors of the king's work;
013	1CH	029	007	And they gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drachms, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of copper eighteen thousand talents, and of iron one hundred thousand talents.
013	1CH	029	008	And those with whom stones were found gave them to the treasury of the house of the Lord, under the supervision of Jechiel the Gershunite.
013	1CH	029	009	Then did the people rejoice, because they had voluntarily offered: for with an undivided heart did they offer to the Lord: and also king David rejoiced with great joy.
013	1CH	029	010	And David blessed the Lord before the eyes of all the congregation; and David said, Blessed be thou, O Lord the God of Israel our father, from everlasting even unto everlasting.
013	1CH	029	011	Thine, O Lord, are the greatness, and the might, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty, yea, all that is in the heavens and on the earth: thine, O Lord, is the kingdom, and thou art exalted as the head above all.
013	1CH	029	012	And riches and honor come from thee, and thou rulest over all; and in thy hand are power and might; and it is in thy hand to make great, and to give strength unto all.
013	1CH	029	013	And now, O our God, we give thanks unto thee, and praise thy glorious name.
013	1CH	029	014	For who am I, and what is my people, that we should possess the power to offer voluntarily after this sort? for from thee is every thing, and out of thy own have we given unto thee.
013	1CH	029	015	For strangers are we before thee, and sojourners, as were all our fathers: like a shadow are our days on the earth, and there is no hope [of abiding].
013	1CH	029	016	O Lord our God! all this abundant store which we have prepared to build for thee a house for thy holy name, is out of thy own hand, and thine is all.
013	1CH	029	017	And I know, my God, that thou probest the heart, and uprightness thou receivest in favor. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart have I voluntarily offered all these things; and now thy people, that are present here, do I see with joy offering voluntarily unto thee.
013	1CH	029	018	O Lord, God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our father, preserve this for ever as the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and direct their heart firmly unto thee.
013	1CH	029	019	And unto Solomon my son do thou give an undivided heart to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all, and to build the palace, for which I have made preparation.
013	1CH	029	020	And David said to all the assembly. Bless now the Lord your God. And all the assembly blessed the Lord the God of their fathers, and bent down their heads, and prostrated themselves to the Lord, and to the king.
013	1CH	029	021	And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the Lord, and they offered burnt-offerings unto the Lord, on the morrow after that day, one thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, a thousand sheep, with their drink-offerings, and [other] sacrifices in abundance for all Israel;
013	1CH	029	022	And they ate and drank before the Lord on that day with great joy. And they declared the second time Solomon the son of David to be king, and they anointed him unto the Lord as chief ruler, and Zadok as priest.
013	1CH	029	023	Then sat Solomon on the throne of the Lord as king instead of David his father, and he was prosperous; and all Israel obeyed him.
013	1CH	029	024	And all the princes, and the mighty men, and also all the sons of king David, submitted themselves unto king Solomon.
013	1CH	029	025	And the Lord made Solomon exceedingly great before the eyes of all Israel; and he bestowed upon him a royal majesty such as had not been on any king over Israel before him.
013	1CH	029	026	Thus did David the son of Jesse reign over all Israel.
013	1CH	029	027	And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years: in Hebron he reigned seven years, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three [years].
013	1CH	029	028	And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor: and Solomon his son became king in his stead.
013	1CH	029	029	And the acts of king David, the first and the last, behold, they are written in the history of Samuel the seer, and in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the seer,
013	1CH	029	030	Together with all his reign and his mighty deeds, and the times that passed over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the [various] countries.

014	2CH	001	001	And Solomon the son of David strengthened himself in his kingdom, and the Lord his God was with him, and caused him to become exceedingly great.
014	2CH	001	002	Then said Solomon unto all Israel, to the captains of the thousands and of the hundreds, and to the judges, and to every prince in all Israel, the chiefs of the family divisions [that they should go with him].
014	2CH	001	003	Thereupon went Solomon, and all the assembly with him, to the high-place that was at Gib'on; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the Lord had made in the wilderness.
014	2CH	001	004	Nevertheless the ark of God had David brought up from Kiryath-ye'arim to [the place which] David had prepared for it; for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.
014	2CH	001	005	But the copper altar, which Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Chur, had made, he placed before the tabernacle of the Lord: and Solomon and the assembly sought for it.
014	2CH	001	006	And Solomon sacrificed there on the copper altar before the Lord, which was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered upon it a thousand burnt-offerings.
014	2CH	001	007	In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee.
014	2CH	001	008	And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shown unto David my father great kindness, and hast made me king in his stead.
014	2CH	001	009	Now, O Lord God, let thy word unto David my father be verified; for thou hast made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth.
014	2CH	001	010	Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who could [otherwise] judge this thy great people?
014	2CH	001	011	And God said unto Solomon, Whereas this hath been in thy heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honor, nor the life of thy enemies, and hast not even asked long life; but hast asked for thyself wisdom and knowledge, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:
014	2CH	001	012	[Therefore] are the wisdom and the knowledge granted unto thee; and riches, and wealth, and honor, will I give thee, such as no kings that have been before thee have had, and the like of which after thee none shall have.
014	2CH	001	013	Then came Solomon from the high-place that was at Gib'on to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the congregation, and reigned over Israel.
014	2CH	001	014	And Solomon brought together chariots and horsemen; and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, and he placed them in the chariot-cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.
014	2CH	001	015	And the king rendered the silver and gold at Jerusalem like stones, and cedar-trees he rendered as the sycamore-trees that are in the lowlands for abundance.
014	2CH	001	016	And Solomon had his horses brought out of Egypt; a company of the king's merchants bought a quantity at a price.
014	2CH	001	017	And they brought up, and fetched out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty; and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.
014	2CH	002	001	And Solomon ordered to build a house for the name of the Lord, and a house for his royal residence.
014	2CH	002	002	And Solomon numbered seventy thousand men to bear burdens, and eighty thousand stonecutters in the mountain, and as superintendents over them three thousand and six hundred.
014	2CH	002	003	And Solomon sent to Churam the king of Tyre, saying, As thou hast dealt with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him a house to dwell therein, [even so deal with me].
014	2CH	002	004	Behold, I am building a house to the name of the Lord my God, to sanctify it to him, to burn before him incense of spices, and for the continual rows of show-bread, and for the burnt-offerings at morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new-moons, and on the stated festivals of the Lord our God: this being for ever obligatory on Israel.
014	2CH	002	005	And the house which I am building is great; for greater is our God than all the gods.
014	2CH	002	006	But who possesseth the power to build him a house? for the heavens and the heavens of heavens cannot contain him: and who am I then, that I should build him a house, save only to burn incense before him?
014	2CH	002	007	And now send me a skilful man to work in gold, and in silver and in copper, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that understandeth how to engrave with the skilful men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem whom David my father hath provided.
014	2CH	002	008	Send me also cedar-trees, fir-trees, and sandal-wood, from the Lebanon; for I know well that thy servants have the skill to cut the trees of Lebanon: and, behold, my servants shall be with thy servants,
014	2CH	002	009	Even to prepare for me timber in abundance; for the house which I am building is to be wonderfully great.
014	2CH	002	010	And, behold, for the hewers that cut the timber will I give unto thy servants twenty thousand cors of threshed wheat, and twenty thousand cors of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.
014	2CH	002	011	Then answered Churam the king of Tyre in writing, and he sent it to Solomon, Out of the love of the Lord for his people hath he set thee as king over them.
014	2CH	002	012	And Churam said, Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel, that hath made the heavens and the earth, who hath given to king David a wise son, endowed with intelligence and understanding, who is to build a house unto the Lord, and a house for royal residence.
014	2CH	002	013	And now have I sent a skilful man, endowed with understanding, namely, Churam-Abi,
014	2CH	002	014	The son of a woman from the daughters of Dan, while his father was a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in copper, in iron, in stone, and in wood, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to execute any manner of engraving, and to devise every kind of work of art which may be given to him, together with thy skilful men, and skilful men of my lord David thy father.
014	2CH	002	015	And now the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, of which my lord hath spoken, let him send unto his servants:
014	2CH	002	016	And we will truly cut down trees out of the Lebanon, as much as thou mayest need; and we will bring them to thee in boats by sea to Joppa; and thou shalt carry them up to Jerusalem.
014	2CH	002	017	And Solomon numbered all the strange men that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them; and they were found to be one hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.
014	2CH	002	018	And he made of them seventy thousand bearers of burdens, and eighty thousand stonecutters in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred superintendents to set the people to work.
014	2CH	003	001	And Solomon began to build the house of the Lord in Jerusalem on mount Moriah, where He had appeared unto David his father, on the place that David had prepared in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
014	2CH	003	002	And he began to build on the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.
014	2CH	003	003	Now in this manner was the foundation laid of the house of God [at its] building [by] Solomon: The length by cubits after the first measure was sixty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.
014	2CH	003	004	And the porch that was in the front of the length was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height was a hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure gold.
014	2CH	003	005	And the great house he ceiled with fir-wood, which he overlaid with pure gold, and he wrought thereon palm-trees and chains.
014	2CH	003	006	And he overlaid the house with costly stones for ornament: and the gold was gold of Parvayim.
014	2CH	003	007	And he covered the house, the beams, the sills, and its walls, and its doors, with gold: and he engraved cherubim on the walls.
014	2CH	003	008	And he made the most holy house, its length being in front of the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and its breadth twenty cubits: and he covered it with fine gold, [amounting] to six hundred talents.
014	2CH	003	009	And the weight of the nails [amounted] to fifty shekels of gold. And the upper chambers he covered with gold.
014	2CH	003	010	And he made in the most holy house two cherubim of sculpture work, and they overlaid them with gold.
014	2CH	003	011	And regarding the wings of the cherubim their length was twenty cubits; the wing of the one amounting to five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing of five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.
014	2CH	003	012	And the wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing of five cubits was joined closely to the wing of the other cherub.
014	2CH	003	013	The wings of these cherubim [as they were] spread out were twenty cubits: and they were standing on their feet, and their faces were inward.
014	2CH	003	014	And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought thereon cherubim.
014	2CH	003	015	And he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits in length, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.
014	2CH	003	016	And he made chains in the debir; and [others which] he placed on the top of the pillars; and he made a hundred pomegranates, and placed them on the chains.
014	2CH	003	017	And he set up the pillars in front of the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and he called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Bo'az.
014	2CH	004	001	He made also an altar of copper, twenty cubits being its length, and twenty cubits its breadth, and ten cubits its height.
014	2CH	004	002	He made also the molten sea, being ten cubits from the one brim to the other, rounded all about, and it was five cubits in height: and a line of thirty cubits did encompass it round about.
014	2CH	004	003	And likenesses of oxen were under it, encompassing it all round about, ten in a cubit, encircling the sea round about: the oxen were in two rows [and were] cast [with it], when it was cast.
014	2CH	004	004	It was standing upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was resting above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.
014	2CH	004	005	And its thickness was a hand's breadth, and its brim like the brim of a cup, with lily-buds; and it could hold and contain three thousand baths.
014	2CH	004	006	He made also ten lavers; and he placed five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them: what belonged to the burnt-offering they rinsed off at them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in.
014	2CH	004	007	And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their prescribed manner: and he placed [them] in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left.
014	2CH	004	008	He made also ten tables, and he set them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made a hundred bowls of gold.
014	2CH	004	009	And he made the court of the priests, and the great out-court, and doors for the out-court, and their doors he overlaid with copper.
014	2CH	004	010	And the sea he placed on the right side toward the east, opposite to the south.
014	2CH	004	011	And Churam made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. And Churam made an end of doing the work which he made for king Solomon in the house of God:
014	2CH	004	012	The two pillars, and the bowls, and the capitals on the top of the two pillars, and the two networks to cover the bowl-shaped capitals which were on the top of the pillars;
014	2CH	004	013	And the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowl-shaped capitals which were upon the front of the pillars.
014	2CH	004	014	The bases also did he make, and the lavers made he upon the bases.
014	2CH	004	015	The one sea, and the twelve oxen under it,
014	2CH	004	016	And the pots also, and the shovels, and the forks, and all their instruments, did Churam-Abiv make for king Solomon for the house of the Lord, of polished copper.
014	2CH	004	017	In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay-ground between Succoth and Zeredathah.
014	2CH	004	018	And Solomon made all these vessels in very great abundance; for the weight of the copper was not inquired into.
014	2CH	004	019	And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained to the house of God; and the altar of gold also, and the tables whereon the show-bread [was set];
014	2CH	004	020	And the candlesticks with their lamps, to light them after the prescribed manner before the debir, of pure gold.
014	2CH	004	021	And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, were of gold, the purest of gold;
014	2CH	004	022	And the knives, and the basins, and the spoons, and the censers were of pure gold; and the entrance of the house, its inner doors for the most holy place, and the doors of the house of the temple, were of gold.
014	2CH	005	001	And so was ended all the work which Solomon made for the house of the Lord; and Solomon brought in the things sanctified by David his father; and the silver, and the gold, and all the vessels he placed in the treasuries of the house of God.
014	2CH	005	002	Then did Solomon assemble the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the divisions of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the city of David, which is Zion.
014	2CH	005	003	And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king at the feast which is [in] the seventh month.
014	2CH	005	004	All the elders of Israel came, and the Levites took up the ark.
014	2CH	005	005	And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle: these did the priests and the Levites bring up.
014	2CH	005	006	And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him were before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, which could not be numbered nor told for multitude.
014	2CH	005	007	And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord unto its place, into the debir of the house, into the most holy place, under the wings of the cherubim.
014	2CH	005	008	And the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and its staves from above.
014	2CH	005	009	And they had made the staves so long that the ends of the staves were seen [standing out] from the ark in the front of the debir; but they were not seen without; and they have remained there until this day.
014	2CH	005	010	There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses had placed [therein] at Horeb, where the Lord made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.
014	2CH	005	011	And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place; for all the priests that were present had sanctified themselves, the divisions not having been observed; —
014	2CH	005	012	And the Levites the singers, all together, of Assaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east side of the altar, and with them were one hundred and twenty priests blowing on trumpets; —
014	2CH	005	013	And it came thus to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the Lord; and when they lifted up their voice [accompanied] with trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and in praising the Lord, For he is good; because unto everlasting endureth his kindness: that the house, even the house of the Lord, was filled with a cloud;
014	2CH	005	014	And the priests were not able to stand to minister because of the cloud; for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of God.
014	2CH	006	001	Then said Solomon, “The Lord said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.
014	2CH	006	002	And I have indeed built a dwelling-house for thee, and have settled a place for thy abode for ever.”
014	2CH	006	003	And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation of Israel, and all the congregation of Israel was standing.
014	2CH	006	004	And he said, Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hands fulfilled it, when he said,
014	2CH	006	005	Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt, I did not make choice of any city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house, that my name might be therein; nor did I make choice of any man to be a ruler over my people of Israel;
014	2CH	006	006	But I have made choice of Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and I have made choice of David to be over my people Israel,
014	2CH	006	007	And it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the Lord the God of Israel.
014	2CH	006	008	But the Lord said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house unto my name, thou didst well in that it was in thy heart:
014	2CH	006	009	Nevertheless thou shalt not thyself build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my name.
014	2CH	006	010	And the Lord hath fulfilled his word that he hath spoken; and I am risen up in the stead of David my father, and I sit on the throne of Israel, as the Lord hath spoken, and I have built the house unto the name of the Lord the God of Israel.
014	2CH	006	011	And I have placed there the ark, wherein is the covenant of the Lord which he hath made with the children of Israel.
014	2CH	006	012	And he now placed himself before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands;
014	2CH	006	013	For Solomon had made a laver of copper, and had placed it in the midst of the out-court, five cubits being its length, five cubits its breadth, and three cubits its height; and he placed himself upon it, and kneeled down upon his knees in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven;
014	2CH	006	014	And he said, O Lord God of Israel, there is no god like thee in the heavens, or on the earth, thou who keepest the covenant, and the kindness for thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart;
014	2CH	006	015	Who has kept for thy servant David my father that which thou hadst promised him; and thou spokest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thy hand, as it is this day.
014	2CH	006	016	And now, O Lord, God of Israel, keep for thy servant David my father that which thou hast spoken concerning him, saying, There shall never fail thee a man in my sight who sitteth on the throne of Israel, if thy children but take heed to their way to walk in my law, as thou hast walked before me.
014	2CH	006	017	And now, O Lord, the God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou hast spoken unto thy servant, unto David.
014	2CH	006	018	For, in truth, will God then dwell with men on the earth? behold, the heavens and the heavens of heavens cannot contain thee: how much less then this house that I have built!
014	2CH	006	019	Yet wilt thou turn thy regard unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O Lord my God, to listen unto the entreaty and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee:
014	2CH	006	020	That thy eyes may be open toward this house day and night, toward the place of which thou hast said that thou wouldst put thy name there; that thou mayest listen unto the prayer which thy servant will pray at this place.
014	2CH	006	021	And listen thou to the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, which they will pray at this place: and oh, do thou hear from thy dwelling-place, from heaven; and hear, and forgive.
014	2CH	006	022	If any man trespass against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thy altar in this house:
014	2CH	006	023	Then do thou hear from heaven, and act, and judge thy servants, by requiting the wicked, to bring his way upon his own head; and by justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.
014	2CH	006	024	And if thy people Israel be struck down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and they return and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication before thee in this house:
014	2CH	006	025	Then do thou hear from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and cause them to return unto the land which thou hast given to them and to their fathers.
014	2CH	006	026	When the heavens be shut up, and there he no rain, because they have sinned against thee, and they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, because thou hast afflicted them:
014	2CH	006	027	Then do thou hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel; for thou wilt direct them unto the good way, wherein they should walk; and give then rain upon thy land, which thou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance.
014	2CH	006	028	If there be famine in the land, if there be pestilence, blasting, or mildew, if there be locusts, or caterpillars; if their enemies besiege them in their land, in their gates at whatsoever plague, and at whatsoever sickness;
014	2CH	006	029	What prayer and what supplication soever be made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, when they shall be conscious every man of his plague and his pain, and he then spread forth his hands toward this house:
014	2CH	006	030	Then do thou hear from heaven the place of thy dwelling, and forgive, and give to every man in accordance with all his ways, as thou mayest know his heart; for thou, thyself alone, knowest the heart of the children of men;
014	2CH	006	031	In order that they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, all the days that they live on the face of the land which thou hast given unto our fathers.
014	2CH	006	032	But also to the stranger, who is not of thy people Israel, but cometh out of a far-off country for the sake of thy great name, and of thy mighty hand, and of thy outstretched arm, — if they come and pray in this house, —
014	2CH	006	033	Mayest thou likewise listen from heaven, from the place of thy dwelling, and do according to all that the stranger will call on thee for: in order that all people of the earth may know thy name, both to fear thee, as do thy people Israel, and to understand that this house, which I have built, is called by thy name.
014	2CH	006	034	If thy people go out to battle against their enemies on the way on which thou mayest send them, and they do pray unto thee in the direction of this city which thou hast chosen, and of the house that I have built unto thy name:
014	2CH	006	035	Then hear thou from heaven their prayer and their supplication, and procure them justice.
014	2CH	006	036	If they sin against thee—for there is no man that may not sin, —and thou be angry with them, and give them up before the enemy, so that their captors carry them away captive unto a land far off or near;
014	2CH	006	037	And if they then take it to their heart in the land whither they have been carried captive, and repent and make supplication unto thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have committed iniquity, and have acted wickedly;
014	2CH	006	038	And they return unto thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have been carried captive, and they pray in the direction of their land, which thou hast given unto their fathers, and of the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built unto thy name:
014	2CH	006	039	Then hear thou from heaven, from the place of thy dwelling, their prayer and their supplications, and procure them justice, and forgive thy people for what they have sinned against thee.
014	2CH	006	040	Now, my God, let I beseech thee, thy eyes be open, and thy ears be attentive unto the prayer on this place.
014	2CH	006	041	And now arise, O Lord God, unto thy resting-place, thou, and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O Lord God, clothe themselves with salvation, and let thy pious servants rejoice in happiness.
014	2CH	006	042	O Lord God, turn not away the face of thy anointed: remember the pious deeds of David thy servant.
014	2CH	007	001	And when Solomon had made an end of praying, a fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt-offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the Lord filled the house.
014	2CH	007	002	And the priests were not able to enter into the house of the Lord; because the glory of the Lord had filled the Lord's house.
014	2CH	007	003	And all the children of Israel were looking on as the fire came down, and the glory of the Lord [was resting] upon the house; and they kneeled down with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and prostrated themselves, and gave thanks unto the Lord, for he is good; because unto everlasting endureth his kindness.
014	2CH	007	004	And the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the Lord.
014	2CH	007	005	And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep: and so they dedicated the house of God, the king and all the people.
014	2CH	007	006	And the priests were standing on their stations, and the Levites with the instruments of the music of the Lord, which king David had made to give thanks unto the Lord, because unto everlasting endureth his kindness, with the song of praise of David in their hand; and the priests blew the trumpets opposite to them, and all Israel were standing.
014	2CH	007	007	And Solomon hallowed the interior of the court that was before the house of the Lord; for he prepared there the burnt-offerings, and the fat of the peace-offerings; because the copper altar which Solomon had made was not able to contain the burnt-offerings, and the meat-offerings, and the fat.
014	2CH	007	008	And Solomon held the feast at that time seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly, from the entrance of Chamath unto the river of Egypt.
014	2CH	007	009	And they held on the eighth day a solemn assembly; for the dedication of the altar they held seven days, and the feast seven days.
014	2CH	007	010	And on the three-and-twentieth day of the seventh month he dismissed the people unto their tents, joyful and glad of heart because of the good that the Lord had done for David, and for Solomon, and for Israel his people.
014	2CH	007	011	Thus did Solomon complete the house of the Lord, and the king's house; and [in] all that came into Solomon's heart to make in the house of the Lord, and in his own house, he prospered.
014	2CH	007	012	Then appeared the Lord to Solomon during the night, and said unto him, I have heard thy prayer, and I have made choice of this place for myself as a house of sacrifice.
014	2CH	007	013	If I shut up the heavens that there be no rain, or if I give a charge to the locusts to devour off the land, or if I send a pestilence among my people:
014	2CH	007	014	And if my people, over whom my name is called, do then humble themselves, and pray, and seek my presence, and turn away from their evil ways: then will I also hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.
014	2CH	007	015	Now, my eyes shall be open, and my ears attentive unto the prayer on this place.
014	2CH	007	016	And now I have chosen and hallowed this house, that my name may be there for ever; and my eyes and my heart shall be there at all times.
014	2CH	007	017	And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father hath walked, so as to do in accordance with all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and my ordinances:
014	2CH	007	018	Then will I establish the throne of thy kingdom, just as I have covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall never fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel.
014	2CH	007	019	But if ye will indeed turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments, which I have set before you, and will go and serve other gods, and bow down to them:
014	2CH	007	020	Then will I pluck them up out of my land which I have given unto them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast away from my sight, and I will render it to be for a proverb and for a by-word among all the people.
014	2CH	007	021	And this house, which hath been so exalted, shall become an astonishment to every one that passeth by it: so that he will say, Why hath the Lord done thus unto this land, and unto this house?
014	2CH	007	022	And men shall then say, For the cause that they forsook the Lord the God of their fathers, who had brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and they took hold of other gods, and bowed down to them, and served them: therefore hath he brought upon them all this evil.
014	2CH	008	001	And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the house of the Lord, and his own house,
014	2CH	008	002	That [as regardeth] the cities which Churam had restored to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.
014	2CH	008	003	And Solomon went to Chamath-zobah, and prevailed against it.
014	2CH	008	004	And he built Thadmor in the wilderness, and all the treasure-cities, which he built in Chamath.
014	2CH	008	005	And he built the upper Beth-choron, and the lower Beth-choron, fortified cities, with walls, gates, and bars;
014	2CH	008	006	And Ba'alath, and all the treasure-cities that Solomon had, and all the cities for chariots, and the cities for horsemen, and all the [other] desire of Solomon which he desired to build in Jerusalem, and in the Lebanon, and throughout all the land of his dominion.
014	2CH	008	007	All the people that were left of the Hittites, and the Emorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of Israel,
014	2CH	008	008	Out of their children, who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel had not destroyed—these did Solomon levy as tributary [laborers] until this day.
014	2CH	008	009	Yet of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen for his work; but they were men of war, and chiefs of his captains; and officers of his chariots and of his horsemen.
014	2CH	008	010	And these were the chiefs of the superintendents whom king Solomon had, [even] two hundred and fifty, who ruled over the people.
014	2CH	008	011	And the daughter of Pharaoh did Solomon bring up out of the city of David unto the house that he had built for her; for he said, No wife of mine shall dwell in a house of David the king of Israel, because they are holy, because there came [once] unto them the ark of the Lord.
014	2CH	008	012	Then did Solomon offer burnt-offerings unto the Lord on the altar of the Lord, which he had built before the porch,
014	2CH	008	013	Even according to what was the due of [every] day on its day, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new-moons, and on the stated festivals, three times in the year, on the feast of unleavened bread, and on the feast of weeks, and on the feast of tabernacles.
014	2CH	008	014	And he stationed, according to the prescription of David his father, the divisions of the priests at their service, and the Levites at their stations, to praise and minister next to the priests, in the requirement of every day on its day, and the gate-keepers in their divisions at every gate; for so was the charge of David the man of God.
014	2CH	008	015	And they departed not from the charge of the king concerning the priests and Levites respecting every matter, and respecting the treasuries.
014	2CH	008	016	And [so] was all the work of Solomon successful from the day of founding the house of the Lord, even until it was finished. [So] was perfected the house of the Lord.
014	2CH	008	017	Then went Solomon to 'Ezyon-geber, and to Eloth, at the sea-shore in the land of Edom.
014	2CH	008	018	And Churam sent him by means of his servants ships, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and they fetched away thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought the same to king Solomon.
014	2CH	009	001	And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with riddles at Jerusalem, with a very great train, and with camels bearing spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she spoke with him of all that was on her heart.
014	2CH	009	002	And Solomon solved for her all her questions; and there was nothing hidden from Solomon which he did not tell her.
014	2CH	009	003	And when the queen of Sheba saw the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,
014	2CH	009	004	And the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cup-bearers, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the Lord: there was no more spirit in her.
014	2CH	009	005	And she said to the king, The truth [only] was the word that I heard in my own land of thy acts, and of thy wisdom.
014	2CH	009	006	And I believed not in their words, until I came, and my eyes saw [all]; and, behold, the one-half of the greatness of thy wisdom hath not been told me: thou excellest the report which I have heard.
014	2CH	009	007	Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, who stand before thee continually, and hear thy wisdom.
014	2CH	009	008	Blessed be the Lord thy God, who hath had delight in thee to place thee on his throne, as a king for the Lord thy God; because thy God loved Israel, to sustain them for ever, therefore hath he placed thee over them as king, to exercise justice and righteousness.
014	2CH	009	009	And she gave to the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices in very great abundance, and precious stones: and there never were any such spices as those which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.
014	2CH	009	010	And also the servants of Churam, and the servants of Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, brought sandal-trees and precious stones.
014	2CH	009	011	And the king made of the sandal-trees steps for the house of the Lord, and for the king's palace, and harps and psalteries for singers: and there were never seen the like of them before in the land of Judah.
014	2CH	009	012	And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her pleasure, whatsoever she asked, beside [a return for] that which she had brought unto the king. And she turned about and went away to her own country, she and her servants.
014	2CH	009	013	Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty and six talents of gold;
014	2CH	009	014	Besides what the travelling tradesmen and the merchants brought. And all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.
014	2CH	009	015	And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of beaten gold he used for each one target.
014	2CH	009	016	And [he made] three hundred shields of beaten gold; three hundred shekels of gold he used for each one shield. And the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
014	2CH	009	017	The king also made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.
014	2CH	009	018	And the throne had six steps, with a footstool of gold, fastened into the throne; and there were arms on either side, on the place of the seat; and two lions stood beside the arms;
014	2CH	009	019	And twelve lions stood there upon the six steps on both sides: there was not the like made in any kingdom.
014	2CH	009	020	And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: no silver was valued in the days of Solomon at the least.
014	2CH	009	021	For the king's ships went to Tharshish with the servants of Churam; once in three years did the Tharshish-ships use to come home laden with gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
014	2CH	009	022	And king Solomon became greater than all the kings of the earth for riches and wisdom.
014	2CH	009	023	And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.
014	2CH	009	024	And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, armor, and spices, horses, and mules; [and] so year by year.
014	2CH	009	025	And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he quartered in the cities for chariots, and near the king at Jerusalem.
014	2CH	009	026	And he was ruling over all the kings from the river even unto the land of the Philistines, and as far as the boundary of Egypt.
014	2CH	009	027	And the king rendered silver in Jerusalem like stones, and the cedar-trees he rendered like the sycamore-trees that are in the lowlands, for abundance.
014	2CH	009	028	And men were bringing out horses for Solomon from Egypt and from all lands.
014	2CH	009	029	And the remainder of the acts of Solomon, the first and the last, behold, they are written in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Achiyah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Ye'do the seer concerning Jerobo'am the son of Nebat.
014	2CH	009	030	And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.
014	2CH	009	031	And Solomon slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David his father: and Rehobo'am his son became king in his stead.
014	2CH	010	001	And Rehobo'am went to Shechem: for to Shechem were all Israel come to make him king.
014	2CH	010	002	And it came to pass, when Jerobo'am the son of Nebat heard of it, for he was in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of king Solomon, that Jerobo'am returned out of Egypt.
014	2CH	010	003	And they sent and called him: and so came Jerobo'am with all Israel and spoke to Rehobo'am, saying,
014	2CH	010	004	Thy father made our yoke hard; but now do thou make lighter the hard service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, and we will serve thee.
014	2CH	010	005	And he said unto them, After but three days, then return unto me. And the people went away.
014	2CH	010	006	Then consulted king Rehobo'am with the old men that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, How do you advise that I should return an answer to this people?
014	2CH	010	007	And they spoke unto him, saying, If thou wilt be kind to this people, and please them, and speak to them good words: then will they be servants unto thee for all times.
014	2CH	010	008	But he forsook the counsel which the old men had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, and who stood before him.
014	2CH	010	009	And he said unto them, How do you counsel how we should give an answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make lighter the yoke which thy father did put upon us?
014	2CH	010	010	Then spoke with him the young men that were grown up with him, saying, Thus must thou say unto the people that have spoken unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but do thou make it lighter unto us: thus must thou say unto them, My little finger is thicker than my father's loins.
014	2CH	010	011	And now [if] my father hath burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: [if] my father hath chastised you with whips, then will I [do it] with scorpion-thorns.
014	2CH	010	012	When now Jerobo'am and all the people came to Rehobo'am on the third day, as the king had spoken, saying, Return to me on the third day:
014	2CH	010	013	The king answered them harshly; and king Rehobo'am forsook the counsel of the old men;
014	2CH	010	014	And he spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add thereto; my father chastised you with whips, but I will [do it] with scorpion-thorns.
014	2CH	010	015	And the king hearkened not unto the people; for it was so brought about from God, in order that the Lord might fulfill his word, which he had spoken by means of Achiyahu the Shilonite unto Jerobo'am the son of Nebat.
014	2CH	010	016	So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? nor have we an inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your tents, O Israel; now, see to thy own house, David. So did all Israel go to their tents.
014	2CH	010	017	But as for the children of Israel who dwelt in the cities of Judah, over them did Rehobo'am reign.
014	2CH	010	018	Then sent king Rehobo'am Hadoram who was over the tribute; but the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehobo'am made speed with his might to get upon his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.
014	2CH	010	019	So did Israel rebel against the house of David unto this day.
014	2CH	011	001	And when Rehobo'am was come to Jerusalem, he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin a hundred and eighty thousand chosen men, warriors, to fight against Israel, to bring back the kingdom again to Rehobo'am.
014	2CH	011	002	But the word of the Lord came unto Shema'yahu the man of God, saying,
014	2CH	011	003	Say unto Rehobo'am the son of Solomon, the king of Judah and Benjamin, saying,
014	2CH	011	004	Thus hath said the Lord, Ye shall not go up, nor fight with your brethren: return every man to his house; for from me hath this thing been brought about. And they hearkened to the words of the Lord, and returned from going against Jerobo'am.
014	2CH	011	005	And Rehobo'am dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities as fortresses in Judah.
014	2CH	011	006	He built, namely, Beth-lechem, and 'Etam, and Thekoa'.
014	2CH	011	007	And Beth-zur, and Socho, and 'Adullam,
014	2CH	011	008	And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,
014	2CH	011	009	And Adorayim and Lachish, and 'Azekah,
014	2CH	011	010	And Zor'ah, and Ayalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin, fortified cities.
014	2CH	011	011	And he strengthened the strong-holds, and put commanders in them, and stores of food, and oil and wine;
014	2CH	011	012	And in each and every city [he placed] shields and spears, and made them exceedingly strong: and thus remained with him Judah and Benjamin.
014	2CH	011	013	And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel presented themselves to him out of all their territory.
014	2CH	011	014	For the Levites left their open districts and their possession, and went to Judah and Jerusalem; because Jerobo'am and his sons cast them off from executing the priest's office unto the Lord,
014	2CH	011	015	And [because] he ordained for himself priests for the high-places, and for the evil spirits, and for the calves which he had made.
014	2CH	011	016	And after them [came] out of all the tribes of Israel such as directed their heart to seek the Lord the God of Israel: these came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice unto the Lord, the God of their fathers.
014	2CH	011	017	And they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and brought power to Rehobo'am, the son of Solomon, during three years; for they walked in the way of David and Solomon during three years.
014	2CH	011	018	And Rehobo'am took himself as wife Machalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, [and] Abichayil the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;
014	2CH	011	019	And she bore to him sons: Je'ush, and Shamaryah, and Zaham.
014	2CH	011	020	And after her did he take Ma'achah the daughter of Abshalom; and she bore to him Abiyah, and 'Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.
014	2CH	011	021	And Rehobo'am loved Ma'achah the daughter of Abshalom more than all his wives and his concubines; for he had taken eighteen wives and sixty concubines; and he begat twenty and eight sons, and sixty daughters.
014	2CH	011	022	And Rehobo'am appointed Abiyah the son of Ma'achah to be the chief, to be ruler among his brethren; because [he desired] to make him king.
014	2CH	011	023	And he dealt understandingly, and dispersed all his children throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto all the fortified cities; and he gave them food in abundance and he required [for them] a multitude of wives.
014	2CH	012	001	And it came to pass, when Rehobo'am had established the kingdom, and when he had become strong, that he forsook the law of the Lord, and all Israel with him.
014	2CH	012	002	And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehobo'am, that Shishak the king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, —because they had acted faithlessly against the Lord, —
014	2CH	012	003	With twelve hundred chariots and sixty thousand horsemen: and innumerable were the people that came with him out of Egypt—the Lubim, the Sukkiyim, and the Ethiopians.
014	2CH	012	004	And he captured the fortified cities which pertained to Judah, and he came as far as Jerusalem.
014	2CH	012	005	And Shem'ayah the prophet came to Rehobo'am, and the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus hath said the Lord, Ye have indeed forsaken me, and therefore have I also relinquished you into the hand of Shishak.
014	2CH	012	006	Thereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The Lord is righteous.
014	2CH	012	007	And when the Lord saw that they had humbled themselves, then came the word of the Lord to Shem'ayah, saying, “They have humbled themselves: I will not destroy them; but I will permit some little to escape from them; and my wrath shall not be poured out over Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.”
014	2CH	012	008	However they shall be servants unto him, and they shall know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the [various] countries.
014	2CH	012	009	And so came up Shishak the king of Egypt against Jerusalem, and he took away the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king's house: every thing did he take away; and he took away the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
014	2CH	012	010	And king Rehobo'am made in their stead shields of copper, and committed them for keeping into the hand of the chiefs of the runners, who kept guard at the door of the king's house.
014	2CH	012	011	And it happened whenever the king went into the house of the Lord, that the runners came and bore them, and carried them back into the apartment of the runners.
014	2CH	012	012	And when he had humbled himself, the wrath of the Lord turned from him, so that he destroyed him not to make an end [of him]: and also in Judah were some good things [found].
014	2CH	012	013	And king Rehobo'am strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned; for Rehobo'am was one and forty years old when he became king, and seventeen years did he reign in Jerusalem, the city which the Lord had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was Na'amah the 'Ammonitess.
014	2CH	012	014	And he did the evil; because he directed not his heart to seek the Lord.
014	2CH	012	015	And the acts of Rehobo'am, the first and the last, behold, they are written in the history of Shem'ayah the prophet, and of 'Iddo, the seer concerning the genealogies. And the wars of Rehobo'am and Jerobo'am [lasted] all the days.
014	2CH	012	016	And Rehobo'am slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abiyah his son became king in his stead.
014	2CH	013	001	In the eighteenth year of king Jerobo'am became Abiyah king over Judah.
014	2CH	013	002	Three years he reigned in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Michayahu the daughter of Uriel of Gib'ah. And there was war between Abiyah and Jerobo'am.
014	2CH	013	003	And Abiyah joined the battle with an army of valiant men of war, even of four hundred thousand chosen men: Jerobo'am also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, being mighty men of valor.
014	2CH	013	004	And Abiyah stood up above mount Zemarayim, which is in the mountain of Ephraim, and said, Hear me, O Jerobo'am, and all Israel;
014	2CH	013	005	Ought ye not to know that the Lord the God of Israel hath given the kingdom over Israel to David for eternity, yea, to him and to his sons by a covenant of salts?
014	2CH	013	006	But there rose up Jerobo'am the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, and rebelled against his lord.
014	2CH	013	007	And there were gathered unto him idle men, worthless persons, and put themselves in violent resistance against Rehobo'am the son of Solomon: while Rehobo'am was young and tender hearted, and could not sustain himself before them.
014	2CH	013	008	And now ye think to sustain yourselves before the kingdom of the Lord in the hand of the sons of David; and ye are a great multitude; and with you are golden calves, which Jerobo'am hath made for you as gods.
014	2CH	013	009	Have ye not cast out the priests of the Lord, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made yourselves priests like the people of the [various] lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams can become a priest to things that are no gods?
014	2CH	013	010	But as for us, the Lord is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and the priests, who minister unto the Lord, are the sons of Aaron; and the Levites are at their [appointed] work;
014	2CH	013	011	And they burn unto the Lord burnt-offerings every morning and every evening and incense of sweet spices; and the rows of the show-bread [do they place] upon the pure table; and there is the candlestick of gold with its lamps, to light the same every evening; for we keep the charge of the Lord our God, while ye have truly forsaken him.
014	2CH	013	012	And, behold, with us at our head, is the [true] God, with his priests with trumpets for blowing the alarm, to sound an alarm against you. O children of Israel, do not fight against the Lord the God of your fathers; for ye will not prosper.
014	2CH	013	013	But Jerobo'am caused an ambush to come around behind them: so they themselves were before Judah, and the ambush was behind them.
014	2CH	013	014	And when Judah turned round, behold, they had the battle before and behind: and they cried unto the Lord, and the priests blew with the trumpets.
014	2CH	013	015	And then gave the men of Judah a shout: and it came to pass, as the men of Judah shouted, that God struck down Jerobo'am and all Israel before Abiyah and Judah.
014	2CH	013	016	And the children of Israel fled from before Judah, and God gave them up into their hand.
014	2CH	013	017	And Abiyah and his people smote them with a great defeat, and there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.
014	2CH	013	018	Thus were the children of Israel humbled at that time: and the children of Judah became powerful, because they relied upon the Lord the God of their fathers.
014	2CH	013	019	And Abiyah made pursuit after Jerobo'am, and captured cities from him, Bethel with its villages, and Jeshanah with its villages, and 'Ephrayin with its villages.
014	2CH	013	020	And Jerobo'am did not recover strength again in the days of Abiyahu: and the Lord struck him, and he died.
014	2CH	013	021	But Abiyahu became strong, and he took himself fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.
014	2CH	013	022	And the rest of the acts of Abiyah, and his ways, and his speeches, are written in the writing of the prophet 'Iddo.
014	2CH	014	001	And Abiyah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Assa his son became king in his stead. In his days the land had repose ten years.
014	2CH	014	002	And Assa did what is good and right in the eyes of the Lord his God.
014	2CH	014	003	And he removed the altars of the strange [gods], and the high-places, and broke up the statues, and cut down the groves;
014	2CH	014	004	And he ordered Judah to seek the Lord the God of their fathers, and to execute the law and the commandment.
014	2CH	014	005	Also he removed out of all the cities of Judah the high-places and the sun-images: and the kingdom had repose before him.
014	2CH	014	006	And he built fortified cities in Judah; for the land had repose, and no one had war with him in those years; because the Lord had given him rest.
014	2CH	014	007	Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and surround them with walls, and towers, gates, and bars: the land is yet before us; because we have sought the Lord our God, —we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.
014	2CH	014	008	And Assa had an army that bore targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bore shields and drew the bow, two hundred and eighty thousand: all these were mighty men of valor.
014	2CH	014	009	And there came out against them Zerach the Ethiopian with an army of a thousand times thousand, and three hundred chariots; and he came as far as Mareshah.
014	2CH	014	010	Then went Assa out against him, and they set themselves in battle-array in the valley of Zephathah near Mareshah.
014	2CH	014	011	And Assa called unto the Lord his God, and said, Lord, nothing can hinder thee to help, whether it be the mighty, or those that have no power: help us, O Lord our God; for on thee do we rely, and in thy name are we come against this multitude. O Lord, thou art our God! no mortal can place a restraint against thee.
014	2CH	014	012	Thereupon did the Lord strike down the Ethiopians before Assa, and before Judah: and the Ethiopians fled.
014	2CH	014	013	And Assa and the people that were with him pursued them as far as Gerar: and there fell of the Ethiopians [so many], that they could not recover themselves; for they were broken down before the Lord, and before his camp; and they carried away exceedingly much booty.
014	2CH	014	014	And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the dread of the Lord was upon them: and they plundered all the cities; for abundant spoil was in them.
014	2CH	014	015	And also the tents of [the owners of] cattle did they smite, and they carried away sheep in abundance, and camels, and returned to Jerusalem.
014	2CH	015	001	And as for 'Azaryahu the son of 'Oded—on him came the spirit of God;
014	2CH	015	002	And he went out to meet Assa, and said unto him, Hear me, O Assa, and all Judah and Benjamin, The Lord is with you, while ye remain with him; and if ye seek him, he will let himself be found by you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.
014	2CH	015	003	And many days [had elapsed] for Israel, [they being] without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law.
014	2CH	015	004	But they returned when they were in distress unto the Lord, the God of Israel, and they sought him, and he let himself be found by them.
014	2CH	015	005	And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, and to him that came in; but there were great confusions among all the inhabitants of the countries.
014	2CH	015	006	And nation was dashed to pieces against nation, and city against city; for God did confound them with all kind of distress.
014	2CH	015	007	But as for you, be ye strong, and let not your hands be weak; for there is a reward for your doing.
014	2CH	015	008	And when Assa heard these words, and the prophecy of 'Oded the prophet, he was strengthened, and he put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had captured from the mountain of Ephraim; and he renewed the altar of the Lord, that was before the porch of the Lord.
014	2CH	015	009	And he assembled all Judah and Benjamin, and those that sojourned with them out of Ephraim and Menasseh, and out of Simeon; for they had joined him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the Lord his God was with him.
014	2CH	015	010	And so they assembled themselves at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Assa.
014	2CH	015	011	And they sacrificed unto the Lord on the same day, of the booty which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.
014	2CH	015	012	And they entered into the covenant to seek the Lord the God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;
014	2CH	015	013	So that whosoever would not seek the Lord the God of Israel should be put to death, from the small even up to the great, whether it be man or woman.
014	2CH	015	014	And they swore unto the Lord with a loud voice, and with [joyful] shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.
014	2CH	015	015	And all Judah rejoiced because of the oath; for with all their heart had they sworn, and with their whole desire did they seek him, and he let himself be found by them: and the Lord gave them rest on every side.
014	2CH	015	016	And also concerning Ma'achah the mother of king Assa, he removed her from being queen, because she had made a scandalous image for the grove; and Assa cut down her scandalous image, and had it ground up, and burnt it by the brook Kidron.
014	2CH	015	017	But the high-places were not removed out of Israel; nevertheless the heart of Assa was entire all his days.
014	2CH	015	018	And be brought the things which his father had sanctified, and his own sanctified things, into the house of God, —silver, and gold, and vessels.
014	2CH	015	019	And there was no war until the five-and-thirtieth year of the reign of Assa.
014	2CH	016	001	In the six-and-thirtieth year of the reign of Assa, came up Ba'sha the king of Israel against Judah, and built Kamah, in order not to suffer any one to go out or come in to Assa the king of Judah.
014	2CH	016	002	Then did Assa bring out silver and gold out of the treasuries of the house of the Lord and of the king's house, and sent [them] to Ben-hadad the king of Syria, who dwelt at Damascus, saying,
014	2CH	016	003	A covenant is between me and thee, as between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee silver and gold; go, break thy covenant with Ba'sha the king of Israel, that he may withdraw from me.
014	2CH	016	004	And Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Assa, and sent the captains of the armies that he had against the cities of Israel, and they smote 'Iyon, and Dan, and Abel-mayim, and all the treasure-cities of Naphtali.
014	2CH	016	005	And it came to pass, when Ba'sha heard this, that he left off the building of Ramah, and stopped his work.
014	2CH	016	006	And king Assa took then all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and its timber, wherewith Ba'sha had built; and he built therewith Geba' and Mizpah.
014	2CH	016	007	And at that time came Chanani the seer to Assa the king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and hast not relied on the Lord thy God: therefore is the army of the king of Syria escaped out of thy hands.
014	2CH	016	008	Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubim a numerous army, with chariots and horsemen in great abundance? yet, because thou didst rely on the Lord, he gave them up into thy hand.
014	2CH	016	009	For as regardeth the Lord, his eyes roam throughout the whole earth, to hold strongly with those whose heart is entire toward him: thou hast done foolishly for this reason; because from this time forth there will be wars with thee.
014	2CH	016	010	Then became Assa incensed toward the seer, and put him in a prison-house; for he was in a rage with him because of this. And Assa oppressed some of the people at the same time.
014	2CH	016	011	And, behold, the acts of Assa, the first and the last, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
014	2CH	016	012	And Assa became sick in the thirty-and-ninth year of his reign in his feet, his disease being exceedingly severe: yet even in his disease he sought not to the Lord, but [applied] to the physicians.
014	2CH	016	013	And Assa slept with his fathers, and died in the one-and-fortieth year of his reign.
014	2CH	016	014	And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had dug for himself in the city of David, and they laid him in the couch which was filled with sweet odors and divers kinds of spices mixed by the apothecary's art; and they made for him a burning uncommonly great.
014	2CH	017	001	And Jehoshaphat his son became king in his stead, and strengthened himself against Israel.
014	2CH	017	002	And he placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah, and placed garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Assa his father had captured.
014	2CH	017	003	And the Lord was with Jehoshaphat; because he walked in the first ways of David his father, and sought not after the Be'alim;
014	2CH	017	004	On the contrary, after the God of his father did he seek, and in his commandments did he walk, but not after the doings of Israel.
014	2CH	017	005	Therefore did the Lord establish the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah gave presents to Jehoshaphat; and he had riches and honor in abundance.
014	2CH	017	006	And his heart raised itself up in the ways of the Lord, and he removed moreover the high-places and groves out of Judah.
014	2CH	017	007	And in the third year of his reign he sent his princes, even Ben-chayil, and 'Obadiah, and Zechariah, and Nethanel, and Michayahu, to teach in the cities of Judah.
014	2CH	017	008	And with them were the Levites, Shema'yahu, and Nethanyahu, and Zebadyahu, and 'Assahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adoniyahu, and Tobiyahu, and Tobadoniyah, the Levites; and with them Elishama' and Jehoram, the priests.
014	2CH	017	009	And they taught in Judah, and with them was the book of the law of the Lord, and they moved about through all the cities of Judah, and taught the people.
014	2CH	017	010	And the dread of the Lord was upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah, so that they made no war with Jehoshaphat.
014	2CH	017	011	Also from the Philistines did people bring unto Jehoshaphat presents and silver, as tribute: also the Arabians brought him small cattle, rams seven thousand and seven hundred, and he-goats seven thousand and seven hundred.
014	2CH	017	012	And Jehoshaphat went on becoming exceedingly great, and he built in Judah castles and treasure-cities.
014	2CH	017	013	And he had great works in the cities of Judah, and men of war, mighty in valor, in Jerusalem.
014	2CH	017	014	And these are their numbers according to their family divisions: Of Judah, of the captains of the thousands was 'Adnah the chief, and with him were mighty men of valor, three hundred thousand.
014	2CH	017	015	And next to him was Jehochanan the chief, and with him were two hundred and eighty thousand.
014	2CH	017	016	And next to him was 'Amassyah the son of Zichri, who voluntarily offered himself unto the Lord; and with him were two hundred thousand mighty men of valor.
014	2CH	017	017	And of Benjamin, the mighty valiant Elyada', and with him were those armed with bow and shield two hundred thousand.
014	2CH	017	018	And next him was Jehozabad, and with him were one hundred and eighty thousand ready armed for the host.
014	2CH	017	019	These were those that ministered to the king, besides those whom the king had placed in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.
014	2CH	018	001	And Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance, and he intermarried with Achab.
014	2CH	018	002	And he went down after [some] years to Achab to Samaria. And Achab killed for him sheep and oxen in abundance, and for the people that were with him, and persuaded him to go up to Ramoth-gil'ad.
014	2CH	018	003	Then said Achab the king of Israel unto Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me against Ramoth-gil'ad! And he said to him, I [will be] like thee, and my people [shall be] as thy people; and we will be with thee in the battle.
014	2CH	018	004	And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray thee, today [first] of the word of the Lord.
014	2CH	018	005	Then did the king of Israel assemble the prophets, four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramoth-gil'ad to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up, and God will deliver [it] into the hand of the king.
014	2CH	018	006	And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the Eternal besides, that we might inquire of him?
014	2CH	018	007	And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, by whom we may inquire of the Lord; but I hate him; for he never prophesieth any good concerning me, but at all times evil: it is Michayhu the son of Yimla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.
014	2CH	018	008	Then called the king of Israel a certain court-officer, and said, “Hasten hither Michayhu the son of Yimla.”
014	2CH	018	009	And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne, dressed in their royal garments, and they were sitting in a threshing-floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria: and all the prophets prophesied before them.
014	2CH	018	010	And Zedekiah the son of Kena'anah had made himself horns of iron; and he said, Thus hath said the Lord, With these shalt thou push the Syrians until thou have made an end of them.
014	2CH	018	011	And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up against Ramoth-gil'ad, and prosper, and the Lord will deliver it into the king's hand.
014	2CH	018	012	And the messenger that went to call Michayhu spoke to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets are with one voice good for the king: so do let thy word, I pray thee, be like [that of] any one of them, and speak something good.
014	2CH	018	013	And Michayhu said, As the Lord liveth, truly what my God may say, that will I speak.
014	2CH	018	014	And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Michah, shall we go to Ramoth-gil'ad to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and may they be delivered into your hand.
014	2CH	018	015	And the king said to him, How many times yet must I adjure thee that thou shalt not speak to me any thing but the truth in the name of the Lord?
014	2CH	018	016	Then said he, I saw all Israel scattered over the mountains, as flocks that have not a shepherd: and the Lord said, These have no master; let them return every man to his house in peace.
014	2CH	018	017	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not say unto thee that he would not prophesy concerning me any good, but [only] for evil?
014	2CH	018	018	And he said, Therefore hear ye the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right and his left.
014	2CH	018	019	And the Lord said, Who will persuade Achab the king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gil'ad? And one said—one saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.
014	2CH	018	020	Then came there forth a spirit, and placed himself before the Lord, and said, I will persuade him. And the Lord said unto him, Wherewith?
014	2CH	018	021	And he said, I will go forth, and I will become a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou wilt persuade him, and also prevail: go forth, and do so.
014	2CH	018	022	And now, behold, the Lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets: but the Lord hath spoken evil concerning thee.
014	2CH	018	023	And Zedekiah the son of Kena'anah went near, and struck Michayhu on the cheek, and said, Which is the way the Spirit of the Lord passed away from me to speak with thee?
014	2CH	018	024	And Michayhu said, Behold, thou shalt see it on that day when thou shalt go into the innermost chamber to hide thyself.
014	2CH	018	025	And the king of Israel said, Take ye Michayhu, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;
014	2CH	018	026	And say ye, Thus hath said the king, Put this man in the prison, and feed him with sparing bread and with sparing water, until I return in peace.
014	2CH	018	027	And Michayhu said, If thou return at all in peace, then hath the Lord not spoken through me. And he said, Hear it, O all ye nations!
014	2CH	018	028	And the king of Israel went up with Jehoshaphat the king of Judah to Ramoth-gil'ad.
014	2CH	018	029	And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but do thou put on thy royal garments. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went into the battle.
014	2CH	018	030	And the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that he had, saying, Fight ye not with the small or with the great, save only with the king of Israel alone.
014	2CH	018	031	And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, This is the king of Israel. And they encompassed him to fight; and Jehoshaphat cried out, and the Lord helped him; and God induced them to go away from him.
014	2CH	018	032	And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from following him.
014	2CH	018	033	But a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and struck the king of Israel between the joints and the armor: wherefore he said to the chariot-driver, Turn about, and carry me out of the camp; for I am wounded.
014	2CH	018	034	And the battle increased on that day: and the king of Israel stayed [himself] up in the chariot against the Syrians until the evening, and he died at the time of the sun's going down.
014	2CH	019	001	And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace, to Jerusalem.
014	2CH	019	002	And there came out to meet him Jehu the son of Chanani the seer, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldst thou help the wicked, and love those that hate the Lord? and because of this there is wrath over thee from before the Lord.
014	2CH	019	003	Nevertheless there are good things found on thee; because thou hast removed the Asheroth out of the land, and hast directed thy heart firmly to seek God.
014	2CH	019	004	And Jehoshaphat remained at Jerusalem; but he went out again through the people from Beer-sheba' as far as the mountain of Ephraim, and caused them to return unto the Lord the God of their fathers.
014	2CH	019	005	And he appointed judges in the land in all the fortified cities of Judah, in city by city.
014	2CH	019	006	And he said to the judges, Look [well] at what ye are doing; because not for man are ye to judge, but for the Lord, who is with you in pronouncing judgment.
014	2CH	019	007	And now let the dread of the Lord be upon you: take heed and act; for with the Lord our God there is no injustice, nor respect for persons, nor taking of bribes.
014	2CH	019	008	But also in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat appoint some of the Levites, and the priests, and of the chiefs of the family divisions of Israel, for the [giving of] the judgment of the Lord, and for controversies, when they returned to Jerusalem.
014	2CH	019	009	And he charged on them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of the Lord, in faithfulness, and with an undivided heart.
014	2CH	019	010	And whatsoever controversy may come to you from your brethren that dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and ordinances, ye shall truly warn them that they incur not guilt against the Lord, and so there come wrath over you, and over your brethren: so must ye do, and ye will not incur guilt.
014	2CH	019	011	And, behold, Amaryahu the chief priest is over you for every matter of the Lord; and Zebadyahu the son of Yishma'el, the ruler for the house of Judah, for every matter of the king; and the Levites are officers before you. Be strong and act, and may the Lord be with the good.
014	2CH	020	001	And it came to pass after this, that the children of Moab, and the children of 'Ammon, and with them some of the 'Ammonim, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.
014	2CH	020	002	And there came some and told unto Jehoshaphat, saying, There is coming against thee a great multitude from beyond the sea, from Syria; and, behold, they are in Chazazon-thamar, which is 'En-gedi.
014	2CH	020	003	Then became Jehoshaphat afraid, and he directed his face to seek the Lord; and he proclaimed a fast over all Judah.
014	2CH	020	004	And [the people of] Judah gathered themselves together, to ask [help] of the Lord: also out of all the cities of Judah did they come to seek the Lord.
014	2CH	020	005	And Jehoshaphat stood forward in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the Lord, before the new court.
014	2CH	020	006	And he said, O Lord, the God of our fathers, thou art God in the heavens, and thou rulest over all the kingdoms of the nations; and in thy hand are the power and might, and there is none that can withstand thee.
014	2CH	020	007	Behold, it is thou, O our God, who hast driven out the inhabitants of this land from before thy people Israel; and thou gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend to eternity.
014	2CH	020	008	And they have dwelt therein, and have built for thee therein a sanctuary for thy name, saying,
014	2CH	020	009	If there should come over us any evil, the sword, punishment, or pestilence, or famine, [then] will we stand before this house, and in thy presence, for thy name is in this house, and we will cry unto thee out of our distress, and thou wilt hear and help.
014	2CH	020	010	And now, behold, the children of 'Ammon and Moab and mount Se'ir, against whom thou wouldst not suffer Israel to come, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned aside from them, and destroyed them not: —
014	2CH	020	011	And behold, they recompense us, by coming to drive us out of thy inheritance, which thou hast given us to possess.
014	2CH	020	012	O our God, wilt thou not execute justice on them? for there is no power in us against this great multitude that is coming against us; and we indeed know not what we are to do: but upon thee are our eyes [directed].
014	2CH	020	013	And all Judah were standing before the Lord, also their little ones, their wives, and their sons.
014	2CH	020	014	And upon Jachaziel the son of Zecharyahu, the son of Benayah, the son of Je'iel, the son of Matthanyah, the Levite, of the sons of Assaph, came the spirit of the Lord in the midst of the assembly;
014	2CH	020	015	And he said, Listen ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus hath said the Lord unto you, Be ye not afraid and be not dismayed because of this great multitude; for not unto you belongeth the battle, but unto God.
014	2CH	020	016	Tomorrow go ye down against them behold, they come up by the ascent of Ziz; and ye will find them at the end of the valley, in front of the wilderness of Jeruel.
014	2CH	020	017	Ye shall not need to fight in this place: stand firmly, stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord with you, O Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, and be not dismayed; tomorrow go out to meet them, and the Lord will be with you.
014	2CH	020	018	And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before the Lord, to prostrate themselves unto the Lord.
014	2CH	020	019	And then arose the Levites, of the children of the Kehathites, and of the children of the Korehites, to praise the Lord the God of Israel with a very loud voice.
014	2CH	020	020	And they rose up early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Thekoa': and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood forward and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; believe in the Lord your God, and ye will have permanence; believe his prophets, and ye will prosper.
014	2CH	020	021	And he consulted with his people, and he appointed singers unto the Lord, and those that should praise in the holy ornaments, as they went out before the armed array, and said, Give thanks unto the Lord; for unto everlasting endureth his kindness.
014	2CH	020	022	And at the time when they began with the song and the praise, the Lord set an ambush against the children of 'Ammon, Moab, and mount Se'ir, who were come against Judah, and they were smitten.
014	2CH	020	023	And the children of 'Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Se'ir, utterly to annihilate and to destroy them; and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Se'ir, they helped to destroy one another.
014	2CH	020	024	And when Judah came toward the watchtower in the wilderness, they looked toward the multitude, and, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and none had escaped.
014	2CH	020	025	And then came Jehoshaphat and his people to plunder their booty, and they found among them in abundance both riches and dead bodies, and costly vessels, which they stript off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in plundering the booty, for it was so much.
014	2CH	020	026	And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah; for there they blessed the Lord: therefore did they call the name of this place, The valley of Berachah [Blessing], until this day.
014	2CH	020	027	Then returned all the men of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat at their head, to return to Jerusalem with joy; for the Lord had caused them to rejoice over their enemies.
014	2CH	020	028	And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and with harps and with trumpets unto the house of the Lord.
014	2CH	020	029	And a dread from God was on all the kingdoms of [those] countries, when they heard that the Lord had fought with the enemies of Israel.
014	2CH	020	030	So the kingdom of Jehoshaphat had repose, and his God gave him rest all round about.
014	2CH	020	031	And [so] did Jehoshaphat reign over Judah; thirty and five years old was he when he became king, and twenty and five years did he reign in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was 'Azubah the daughter of Shilchi.
014	2CH	020	032	And he walked in the way of his father Assa, and turned not aside from it, doing what is right in the eyes of the Lord.
014	2CH	020	033	Nevertheless the high-places were not removed; for the people had not yet directed their heart firmly unto the God of their fathers.
014	2CH	020	034	And the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, the first and the last, behold, they are written in the history of Jehu the son of Chanani, which was entered into the book of the kings of Israel.
014	2CH	020	035	And after this did Jehoshaphat the king of Judah connect himself with Achazyah the king of Israel, the same who acted very wickedly;
014	2CH	020	036	And he connected himself with him to make ships to go to Tharshish: and they made ships in 'Ezyon-geber.
014	2CH	020	037	Then prophesied Eli'ezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast connected thyself with Achazyahu, the Lord hath broken down thy works. And the ships were wrecked, so that they were not able to go to Tharshish.
014	2CH	021	001	And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son became king in his stead.
014	2CH	021	002	And he had brothers the sons of Jehoshaphat: 'Azaryah, and Jechiel, and Zecharyahu, and 'Azaryahu, and Michael, and Shephatyahu, all these being sons of Jehoshaphat the king of Israel.
014	2CH	021	003	And their father gave them many gifts [consisting] of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fortified cities in Judah; but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram; because he was the first-born.
014	2CH	021	004	Now when Jehoram was risen up over the kingdom of his father, and had strengthened himself, he slew all his brothers with the sword, and also some of the princes of Israel.
014	2CH	021	005	Thirty and two years was Jehoram old when he became king, and eight years did he reign in Jerusalem.
014	2CH	021	006	And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as had done the house of Achab; for the daughter of Achab had he for wife: and he did what is evil in the eyes of the Lord.
014	2CH	021	007	Yet would the Lord not destroy the house of David, on account of the covenant which he had made with David, and as he had said to give to him a government and to his sons at all times.
014	2CH	021	008	In his days Edom revolted from under the power of Judah, and they appointed a king over themselves.
014	2CH	021	009	Then did Jehoram go over with his princes, and all the chariots were with him; and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites who compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots.
014	2CH	021	010	Yet Edom revolted from under the power of Judah even until this day: then did Libnah revolt at the same time from under his power; because he had forsaken the Lord the God of his fathers.
014	2CH	021	011	He also made high-places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go astray, and misled Judah.
014	2CH	021	012	And there came unto him a writing from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus hath said the Lord the God of David thy father, Inasmuch as thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, and in the ways of Assa the king of Judah,
014	2CH	021	013	But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast caused Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go astray, as the house of Achab hath caused [others] to go astray, and hast also slain thy brothers of thy father's house, who were better than thyself:
014	2CH	021	014	Behold, the Lord will inflict a great plague on thy people, and on thy children, and on thy wives, and on all thy possessions;
014	2CH	021	015	And thou shalt be [afflicted] with great diseases by a disease of thy bowels, until thy bowels pass out [from thee] by reason of the disease days upon days.
014	2CH	021	016	And the Lord stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that are alongside of the Cushim:
014	2CH	021	017	And they went up against Judah, and made an incursion into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and also his sons, and his wives; and there was not left unto him any son, save Jehoachaz, the youngest of his sons.
014	2CH	021	018	And after all this did the Lord afflict him in his bowels with a disease which was incurable.
014	2CH	021	019	And it came to pass, from days to days, and when the [fixed] time was expired, after two years, that his bowels passed out [from him] by reason of his disease: so he died of evil diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning for his fathers.
014	2CH	021	020	Thirty and two years old was he when he became king, and eight years did he reign in Jerusalem, and departed without joy: and they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings.
014	2CH	022	001	And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Achazyahu his youngest son king in his stead; for the predatory band that was come with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So became Achazyahu, the son of Jehoram the king of Judah, king.
014	2CH	022	002	Forty and two years old was Achazyahu when he became king, and one year did he reign in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Athalyahu the [grand-]daughter of 'Omri.
014	2CH	022	003	Also he walked in the ways of the house of Achab; for his mother was his counsellor to act wickedly.
014	2CH	022	004	And he did what is evil in the eyes of the Lord like the house of Achab; for these were his counsellors after the death of his father to his destruction.
014	2CH	022	005	He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Achab the king of Israel to war against Chazael the king of Syria at Ramoth-gil'ad: and the Syrians smote Joram.
014	2CH	022	006	And he returned to be healed in Yizre'el because of the wounds which had been given him at Ramah, when he fought with Chazael the king of Syria. And 'Azaryahu the son of Jehoram the king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Achab at Yizre'el, because he was sick.
014	2CH	022	007	But from God was the confusion of Achazyahu that he should come to Joram: and when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the Lord had anointed to cut off the house of Achab.
014	2CH	022	008	And it came to pass, when Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Achab, that he found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brothers of Achazyahu, that ministered to Achazyahu, and he slew them.
014	2CH	022	009	And he sought Achazyahu, and they caught him while he was hiding himself in Samaria, and they brought him to Jehu, and they slew him, and buried him; because they said, He is son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the Lord with all his heart. And there was none of the house of Achazyahu who had sufficient power [to obtain] the kingdom.
014	2CH	022	010	And when 'Athalyahu the mother of Achazyahu saw that her son was dead, she arose and exterminated all the royal seed of the house of Judah.
014	2CH	022	011	But Yehoshab'ath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Achazyahu, and stole him away from the midst of the king's sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse into the bed-chamber. So did Yehoshab'ath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Yehoyada' the priest, —for she was the sister of Achazyahu, —hide him from 'Athalyahu, so that she slew him not.
014	2CH	022	012	And he was with them in the house of God hidden six years, while 'Athalyah was reigning over the land.
014	2CH	023	001	And in the seventh year Yehoyada' strengthened himself, and took the captains of the hundreds, 'Azaryah the son of Jerocham and Yishma'el the son of Jehochanan, and 'Azaryahu the son of 'Obed, and Ma'asseyahu the son of 'Adayahu, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, with him into a covenant.
014	2CH	023	002	And they moved about in Judah, and gathered the Levites together out of all the cities of Judah, and the heads of the families of Israel; and they came to Jerusalem.
014	2CH	023	003	And all the congregation made a covenant in the house of God with the king. And he said unto them, Behold, the king's son shall be king, as the Lord hath spoken concerning the sons of David.
014	2CH	023	004	This is the thing that ye shall do, A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be gatekeepers at the thresholds;
014	2CH	023	005	And a third part shall be at the king's house; and a third part at the foundation-gate; and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the Lord.
014	2CH	023	006	But let none come into the house of the Lord, save the priests, and they that minister of the Levites: they shall enter, for they are holy; but all the people shall keep the charge of the Lord.
014	2CH	023	007	And the Levites shall encompass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand: and he who cometh into the house shall be put to death; and be ye with the king when he cometh in, and when he goeth out.
014	2CH	023	008	And the Levites and all Judah did in accordance with all that Yehoyada' the priest had commanded, and they took every man his men that came in on the sabbath, with those that were to be relieved on the sabbath; for Yehoyada' the priest had not dismissed the divisions.
014	2CH	023	009	And Yehoyada' the priest gave to the captains of the hundreds the spears, and the shields, and the quivers, that belonged to king David, which were in the house of God.
014	2CH	023	010	And he placed all the people, every man having his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and the temple, all round about the king,
014	2CH	023	011	Then did they bring forth the king's son, and put upon him the crown, and [gave him] the testimony, and they made him king. And Yehoyada' and his sons anointed him, and said, Long live the king.
014	2CH	023	012	And when 'Athalyah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the Lord.
014	2CH	023	013	And she looked, and behold, the king stood upon his stand at the entrance, and the princes and the trumpets were around the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew on trumpets; also the singers [were there] leading with instruments of music in the songs of praise; and 'Athalyah rent her clothes, and said, “Treason, treason.”
014	2CH	023	014	But Yehoyada' the priest ordered the captains of the hundreds, the commanders of the army, to go out, and said unto them, Lead her forth to within the ranges; and he that followeth her shall be put to death with the sword. For the priest had said, Ye shall not put her to death in the house of the Lord.
014	2CH	023	015	And they made way for her: and she went to the entrance of the horse-gate by the king's house, and they put her to death there.
014	2CH	023	016	And Yehoyada' made a covenant between him, and between all the people, and between the king, that they should be a people unto the Lord.
014	2CH	023	017	And then came all the people into the house of Ba'al, and pulled it down, and his altars and his images did they break in pieces, and Mathhan the priest of Ba'al they slew before the altars.
014	2CH	023	018	And Yehoyada' placed the supervision over the house of the Lord into the hand of the priests, the Levites, whom David had divided off over the house of the Lord, to offer the burnt-offerings of the Lord, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, after the manner of David.
014	2CH	023	019	And he appointed the gatekeepers over the gates of the house of the Lord, that none unclean in any thing should enter therein.
014	2CH	023	020	And he took the captains of the hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors over the people, and all the people of the land, and he brought down the king from the house of the Lord, and they came through the midst of the upper gate into the king's house; and they caused the king to sit upon the throne of the kingdom.
014	2CH	023	021	And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet; but 'Athalyahu they had slain with the sword.
014	2CH	024	001	Seven years old was Joash when he became king, and forty years did he reign in Jerusalem: and the name of his mother was Zibyah of Beer-sheba'.
014	2CH	024	002	And Joash did what is right in the eyes of the Lord, all the days of Yehoyada' the priest.
014	2CH	024	003	And Yehoyada' took for himself two wives, and he begat sons and daughters.
014	2CH	024	004	And it came to pass after this, that Yoash had it in his mind to renew the house of the Lord.
014	2CH	024	005	And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather from all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and ye shall make haste in this matter. But the Levites made no haste.
014	2CH	024	006	Then called the king for Yehoyada' the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required from the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the contribution [fixed by] Moses the servant of the Lord, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of the testimony?
014	2CH	024	007	For the sons of the wicked 'Athalyahu have made breaches [in] the house of God; and also the holy things of the house of the Lord have they applied to the Be'alim.
014	2CH	024	008	And at the king's order they made a chest, and placed it at the gate of the house of the Lord on the outside.
014	2CH	024	009	And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the Lord the contribution [fixed by] Moses the servant of God upon Israel in the wilderness.
014	2CH	024	010	And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and they brought it in, and cast it into the chest, until it was full.
014	2CH	024	011	Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, then came the king's scribe and the high-priest's officer and emptied the chest, and took it up, and brought it back to its place. Thus did they day by day, and gathered money in abundance.
014	2CH	024	012	And the king and Yehoyada' gave it to those who overlooked the service of the house of the Lord, and these hired masons and carpenters to renew the house of the Lord, and also to the workers in iron and copper to repair the house of the Lord.
014	2CH	024	013	So the workmen wrought, and the work was restored through their means, and they replaced the house of God in its [former] state, and strengthened it.
014	2CH	024	014	And when they had completed it, they brought before the king and Yehoyada' the rest of the money, and they made of it vessels for the house of the Lord, the vessels of the service and for the sacrificing, and the spoons, and [other] vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt-offerings in the house of the Lord continually all the days of Yehoyada'.
014	2CH	024	015	And Yehoyada' became old, and was full of days, and died: he was old one hundred and thirty years when he died.
014	2CH	024	016	And they buried him in the city of David among the kings; because he had done a good thing in Israel, and toward God, and his house.
014	2CH	024	017	But after the death of Yehoyada' came the princes of Judah, and bowed themselves down to the king. Then did the king hearken unto them.
014	2CH	024	018	And they forsook the house of the Lord the God of their fathers, and served the Asherim and the idols: and there came wrath over Judah and Jerusalem for this their guiltiness.
014	2CH	024	019	And he sent prophets among them, to bring them back again unto the Lord; and they gave them warning; but they did not give ear.
014	2CH	024	020	And the spirit of God endued Zechariah the son of Yehoyada' the priest, and he stood up above the people, and he said unto them, Thus hath said the [true] God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the Lord? ye cannot prosper so; because [as] ye have forsaken the Lord, he hath also forsaken you.
014	2CH	024	021	And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the command of the king in the court of the house of the Lord.
014	2CH	024	022	And king Joash did not remember the kindness which Yehoyada' his father had shown to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, The Lord will see [this], and require [my blood].
014	2CH	024	023	And it came to pass at the expiration of the year, that the army of Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and all their spoil they sent off unto the king of Damascus.
014	2CH	024	024	Indeed with a small company of men did the army of Syria come; but the Lord delivered into their hand an army exceedingly numerous; because they had forsaken the Lord the God of their fathers. And on Joash they executed punishment.
014	2CH	024	025	And when these were gone away from him—for they left him [suffering] with great diseases—his own servants conspired against him because of the blood of the sons of Yehoyada' the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings.
014	2CH	024	026	And these are those that conspired against him; Zabad the son of Shim'ath the 'Ammonitess, and Yehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess.
014	2CH	024	027	Now concerning his sons, and the great prophecy concerning him, and the founding of the house of God, behold, they are written in the story of the book of the kings. And Amazyahu his son became king in his stead.
014	2CH	025	001	When twenty and five years old did Amazyahu become king, and twenty and nine years did he reign in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Yeho'addan of Jerusalem.
014	2CH	025	002	And he did what is right in the eyes of the Lord, yet not with an entire heart.
014	2CH	025	003	And it came to pass, when the kingdom was firmly established to him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father.
014	2CH	025	004	But their children he put not to death; but [did] as it is written in the law in the book of Moses, that the Lord had commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, nor shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.
014	2CH	025	005	And Amazyahu gathered Judah together, and stationed them after the family divisions, after the captains over the thousands, and after the captains over the hundreds, of all Judah and Benjamin; and he numbered them from twenty years old and upward, and found them [to be] three hundred thousand chosen men, able to go forth to the army, that could handle spear and shield.
014	2CH	025	006	He hired also out of Israel one hundred thousand mighty men of valor for one hundred talents of silver.
014	2CH	025	007	But a man of God came unto him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the Lord is not with Israel, [with] all the children of Ephraim.
014	2CH	025	008	But if thou wilt go, [and be ever so] active [and] strong for the battle: God will cause thee to stumble before the enemy; for there is power with God to help, and to cause to stumble.
014	2CH	025	009	Then said Amazyahu to the man of God, But what is it to be done for the hundred talents which I have given to the band of Israel? And the man of God said, The Lord hath [enough in his power] to give thee much more than this.
014	2CH	025	010	Then did Amazyahu separate them, [to wit,] the band that was come to him out of Ephraim, that they might go to their place: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned to their home in burning anger.
014	2CH	025	011	And Amazyahu strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the Valley of Salt, and smote of the children of Se'ir ten thousand [men].
014	2CH	025	012	And ten thousand did the children of Judah take captive alive, and brought them to the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, so that they all were crushed.
014	2CH	025	013	But the men of the band whom Amazyahu had sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, spread themselves about in the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Beth-choron, and smote of them three thousand [persons], and plundered much spoil.
014	2CH	025	014	And it came to pass, after Amazyahu was come home from smiting the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Se'ir, and set them up unto himself as gods, and before them he used to prostrate himself and unto them he used to burn incense.
014	2CH	025	015	Wherefore the anger of the Lord was kindled against Amazyahu, and he sent unto him a prophet, who said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, that have not delivered their own people out of thy hand?
014	2CH	025	016	And it came to pass, as he was speaking unto him, that he said unto him, Have we ever appointed thee as a counsellor to the king? forbear this: why shouldst thou be smitten? Then did the prophet forbear; and he said, I know that God hath resolved to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.
014	2CH	025	017	Then held Amazyahu the king of Judah a council, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoachaz, the son of Jehu, the king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.
014	2CH	025	018	And Joash the king of Israel sent to Amazyahu the king of Judah, saying, The thorn-bush that was in the Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in the Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son for wife. And there passed along the wild beasts that were in the Lebanon, and trod down the thorn-bush.
014	2CH	025	019	Thou hast thought, Lo, thou hast smitten Edom; and thy heart hath lifted thee up to acquire much glory: now stay in thy house; why wilt thou meddle with misfortune, that thou mayest fall, thou, and Judah with thee?
014	2CH	025	020	But Amazyahu would not hear; for it was [ordained] by God, in order to deliver them into the hand [of Joash]; because they had sought after the gods of Edom.
014	2CH	025	021	Thereupon did Joash the king of Israel go up: and they looked one another in the face, he and Amazyahu the king of Judah, at Beth-shemesh, which belongeth to Judah.
014	2CH	025	022	And Judah was defeated before Israel, and they fled every man to his tents.
014	2CH	025	023	And Joash the king of Israel caught Amazyahu the king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoachaz, at Beth-shemesh; and he brought him to Jerusalem, and made a breach in the wall of Jerusalem, from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner-gate, four hundred cubits.
014	2CH	025	024	And [taking] all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with 'Obed-edom, and the treasures of the king's house, and the children of the chiefs as hostages, he returned to Samaria.
014	2CH	025	025	And Amazyahu the son of Joash the king of Judah lived after the death of Joash the son of Jehoachaz the king of Israel fifteen years.
014	2CH	025	026	And the rest of the acts of Amazyahu the first and the last, behold, they are fully written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
014	2CH	025	027	Now from the time that Amazyahu departed from following the Lord, they raised a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem: wherefore he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.
014	2CH	025	028	And they carried him on horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.
014	2CH	026	001	And all the people of Judah took 'Uzziyahu, who was then sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amazyahu.
014	2CH	026	002	He it was that built Eloth, and brought it back to Judah, after the king slept with his fathers.
014	2CH	026	003	Sixteen years old was 'Uzziyahu when he became king, and fifty and two years did he reign in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Yecholyah of Jerusalem.
014	2CH	026	004	And he did what is right in the eyes of the Lord, in accordance with all that his father Amazyahu had done.
014	2CH	026	005	And he was [inclined] to seek God in the days of Zecharyahu, who had understanding in the visions of God; and during the time that he sought the Lord, God caused him to prosper.
014	2CH	026	006	And he went forth and made war against the Philistines, and he broke down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod; and he built cities in [the country of] Ashdod, and among the Philistines.
014	2CH	026	007	And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gur-ba'al, and the Me'unim.
014	2CH	026	008	And the 'Ammonites gave presents to 'Uzziyahu: and his name extended even to the entrance of Egypt; for he became exceedingly strong.
014	2CH	026	009	And 'Uzziyahu built towers in Jerusalem, above the corner-gate, and above the valley-gate, and at the angle, and made them strong.
014	2CH	026	010	He built also towers in the desert, and hewed out many wells; for he had much cattle, both in the lowlands and in the plain; [also] husbandmen, and vintners in the mountains, and in Carmel; for he loved husbandry.
014	2CH	026	011	Moreover 'Uzziyah had an army of fighting men, that went out to the host by bands, according to the number of those mustered of them through the hand of Je'iel the scribe and Ma'asseyahu the overseer, under the supervision of Chananyahu, one of the king's captains.
014	2CH	026	012	The whole number of the chiefs of the family divisions of the mighty men of valor was two thousand and six hundred.
014	2CH	026	013	And under their supervision was an efficient army, [of] three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.
014	2CH	026	014	And 'Uzziyahu prepared for them, for all the host, shields, and spears, and helmets, and coats of mail, and bows, and stones for slinging.
014	2CH	026	015	And he made in Jerusalem artificial contrivances, contrived by a skilful man, to be [stationed] on the towers and upon the ramparts, to shoot off arrows and great stones. And his name extended ever so far abroad; for he was marvelously assisted, till he became strong.
014	2CH	026	016	But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction; and he became unfaithful against the Lord his God, and went into the temple of the Lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense.
014	2CH	026	017	And there went in after him 'Azaryahu the priest, and with him were priests of the Lord, valiant men, [to the number of] eighty;
014	2CH	026	018	And they stood forward against king 'Uzziyahu, and they said unto him, It is not for thee, O 'Uzziyahu, to burn incense unto the Lord, but for the priests the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; and it will not be for thy honor from the Lord God.
014	2CH	026	019	But 'Uzziyahu became wroth, and in his hand was a censer to burn incense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even broke out on his forehead before the priests in the house of the Lord, above the altar of the incense.
014	2CH	026	020	And when 'Azaryahu the chief priest, with all the priests, turned about toward him, behold, he was leprous on his forehead, and they hurried him away from there: yea, he also made haste to go out, because the Lord had afflicted him.
014	2CH	026	021	And king 'Uzziyahu was a leper until the day of his death, and dwelt in the leper-house, as a leper; for he was excluded from the house of the Lord: and Jotham his son was over the king's house, [and] judged the people of the land.
014	2CH	026	022	And the rest of the acts of 'Uzziyahu, the first and the last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amos write.
014	2CH	026	023	And 'Uzziyahu slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the burial-field which belonged to the kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son became king in his stead.
014	2CH	027	001	Twenty and five years old was Jotham when he became king, and sixteen years did he reign in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Yerushah, the daughter of Zadok.
014	2CH	027	002	And he did what is right in the eyes of the Lord, in accordance with all that his father 'Uzziyahu had done: only he entered not into the temple of the Lord. But the people acted still corruptly.
014	2CH	027	003	He it was that built the upper gate of the house of the Lord, and on the wall of the hill-fort he built much.
014	2CH	027	004	Moreover he built cities in the mountain of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers.
014	2CH	027	005	And he likewise fought with the king of the sons of 'Ammon, and prevailed against them. And the children of 'Ammon gave him in that same year one hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand kors of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of 'Ammon pay unto him again, both in the second year, and in the third.
014	2CH	027	006	So Jotham became strong; because he directed his ways before the Lord his God.
014	2CH	027	007	And the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
014	2CH	027	008	Five and twenty years old was he when he became king, and sixteen years did he reign in Jerusalem.
014	2CH	027	009	And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Achaz his son became king in his stead.
014	2CH	028	001	Twenty years old was Achaz when he became king, and sixteen years did he reign in Jerusalem; and he did not what is right in the eyes of the Lord, like David his father;
014	2CH	028	002	But he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for the Be'alim.
014	2CH	028	003	And he also burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his sons in the fire, after the abominable acts of the nations that the Lord had driven out from before the children of Israel.
014	2CH	028	004	And he sacrificed and burnt incense on the high-places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
014	2CH	028	005	Wherefore the Lord his God gave him up into the hand of the king of Syria; and they defeated his people, and carried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought them to Damascus. And also into the hand of the king of Israel was he given up, and he defeated his people with a great slaughter.
014	2CH	028	006	And Pekach the son of Remalyahu slew in Judah one hundred and twenty thousand in one day, all being valiant men; because they had forsaken the Lord, the God of their fathers.
014	2CH	028	007	And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Ma'asseyahu the king's son, and 'Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah the second in rank to the king.
014	2CH	028	008	And the children of Israel led away captive from their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and also much booty did they plunder from them, and they brought the booty to Samaria.
014	2CH	028	009	But there was a prophet of the Lord, 'Oded was his name; and he went out to meet the host that was coming to Samaria, and said unto them, Behold, because of the fury of the Lord the God of your fathers against Judah, hath he given them up into your hand, and ye have slain among them in a rage that reacheth as far as the heavens.
014	2CH	028	010	And now ye think to force the children of Judah and Jerusalem to become bond-men and bond-women unto you; but surely are there not with you, even with you, trespasses against the Lord your God?
014	2CH	028	011	And now hear me, and restore the captives, whom ye have taken captive from your brethren; for the fierce wrath of the Lord is over you.
014	2CH	028	012	Then arose certain men of the heads of the children of Ephraim, 'Azaryahu the son of Jehochanan, Berechyahu the son of Meshillemoth, and Jechizkiyahu the son of Shallum, and 'Amassa the son of Chadlai, against those that were come from the army.
014	2CH	028	013	And they said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither; for in addition to the guiltiness against the Lord [resting] on us, ye think to add unto our sins and unto our guiltiness; for great is the guiltiness [resting] on us, and there is fierce wrath over Israel.
014	2CH	028	014	So the armed men abandoned the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the assembly.
014	2CH	028	015	And then arose the men who have been expressed by name, and took hold of the captives, and all that were naked among them they clothed from the booty; and they gave them garments and shoes, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm-trees, near their brethren; and then did they return to Samaria.
014	2CH	028	016	At that time sent king Achaz unto the kings of Assyria to help him.
014	2CH	028	017	Moreover the Edomites came again and defeated [the men of] Judah, and carried away captives.
014	2CH	028	018	And the Philistines invaded the cities of the lowlands, and of the south of Judah, and captured Beth-shemesh, and Ayalon, and Gederoth, and Socho with its villages, and Thimnah with its villages, and Gimzo with its villages; and they dwelt there.
014	2CH	028	019	For the Lord humbled Judah on account of Achaz the king of Israel; for he made Judah unruly, and acted very faithlessly against the Lord.
014	2CH	028	020	Then came against him Tilgath-pilneesser the king of Assyria, and distressed him, but strengthened him not.
014	2CH	028	021	Although Achaz took away a portion [out] of the house of the Lord, and [out] of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave it unto the king of Assyria: he yet gave him no assistance.
014	2CH	028	022	And in the time that he distressed him, became he yet more faithless against the Lord, —yea, he, king Achaz;
014	2CH	028	023	And he sacrificed unto the gods of [the people of] Damascus, who had smitten him; and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria do help them, [therefore] will I sacrifice unto them, that they may help me. But they only became to him a stumbling-block for him and for all Israel.
014	2CH	028	024	And Achaz gathered up the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and locked up the doors of the house of the Lord, and he made for himself altars in every corner of Jerusalem.
014	2CH	028	025	And in each and every city of Judah made he high-places to burn incense unto other gods; and he provoked to anger the Lord the God of his fathers.
014	2CH	028	026	And the rest of his acts and of all his ways, the first and the last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
014	2CH	028	027	And Achaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, in Jerusalem; for they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son became king in his stead.
014	2CH	029	001	Hezekiah became king when five and twenty years old, and twenty and nine years did he reign in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Abiyah, the daughter of Zecharyahu.
014	2CH	029	002	And he did what is right in the eyes of the Lord, in accordance with all that David his father had done.
014	2CH	029	003	He it was that in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of the Lord, and repaired them.
014	2CH	029	004	And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the open place at the east;
014	2CH	029	005	And he said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify yourselves now, and sanctity the house of the Lord the God of your fathers, and carry forth the unclean thing out of the sanctuary.
014	2CH	029	006	For our fathers have dealt faithlessly, and have done what is evil in the eyes of the Lord our God, and have forsaken him; and they have turned away their faces from the habitation of the Lord, and turned their backs.
014	2CH	029	007	They had also locked up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and incense have they not burnt, and the burnt-offerings have they not offered in the sanctuary, unto the God of Israel.
014	2CH	029	008	Wherefore the wrath of the Lord is upon Judah and Jerusalem. and he hath rendered them to be a horror, an astonishment, and a hissing, as ye see with your eyes.
014	2CH	029	009	And, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons, and our daughters, and our wives are in captivity because of this.
014	2CH	029	010	Now it is in my heart to make a covenant for the Lord the God of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us.
014	2CH	029	011	My sons, be not negligent now; for of you hath the Lord made choice to stand before him, to minister unto him, and that ye might be unto him ministers and those that burn incense.
014	2CH	029	012	Then arose the Levites, Machath the son of 'Amassai, and Joel the son of 'Azaryahu, of the sons of the Kehathites; and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of 'Abdi, and 'Azaryahu the son of Jehallelel; and of the Gershunites, Joach the son of Zimmah, and 'Eden the son of Joach:
014	2CH	029	013	And of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri, and Je'iel; and of the sons of Assaph, Zecharyahu and Matthanyahu;
014	2CH	029	014	And of the sons of Heman, Jechiel and Shim'i; and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shema'yah and 'Uzziel;
014	2CH	029	015	And they gathered together their brethren, and they sanctified themselves, and came, according to the command of the king, by the words of the Lord, to cleanse the house of the Lord.
014	2CH	029	016	And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the Lord, to cleanse it; and they brought out every thing unclean which they found in the temple of the Lord into the court of the house of the Lord; and the Levites received it, to carry it out abroad unto the brook Kidron.
014	2CH	029	017	And they commenced on the first day of the first month to sanctify; and on the eighth day of the month they came to the porch of the Lord, and they sanctified the house of the Lord in eight days; and on the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.
014	2CH	029	018	Then went they in the inner part [of the palace] to king Hezekiah, and said, We have cleansed all the house of the Lord, and the altar of burnt-offering, and all its vessels, and the table of shewbread, and all its vessels.
014	2CH	029	019	Moreover all the vessels, which king Achaz had cast aside during his reign in his faithlessness, have we put in order and sanctified: and, behold, they are before the altar of the Lord.
014	2CH	029	020	Then arose king Hezekiah early, and gathered together the princes of the city, and went up to the house of the Lord.
014	2CH	029	021	And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven sheep, and seven he-goats, as a sin-offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he ordered the sons of Aaron the priests to offer [them] on the altar of the Lord.
014	2CH	029	022	So they slaughtered the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar; and they slaughtered the rams, and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar; they also slaughtered the sheep, and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar.
014	2CH	029	023	And they brought near the he-goats of the sin-offering before the king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them:
014	2CH	029	024	And the priests slaughtered them, and they made an expiation with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel; because for all the people, said the king, should be the burnt-offering and the sin-offering.
014	2CH	029	025	And he stationed the Levites in the house of the Lord with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the command of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet: because from the Lord was this commandment by means of his prophets.
014	2CH	029	026	And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.
014	2CH	029	027	And Hezekiah ordered to offer the burnt-offering on the altar. And when the burnt-offering began, the song of the Lord began [also] with the trumpets, and with the instruments of David the king of Israel.
014	2CH	029	028	And all the assembly prostrated themselves, and the song sounded, and the trumpeters blew; all this [continued] until the burnt-offering was completed.
014	2CH	029	029	And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him kneeled down and prostrated themselves.
014	2CH	029	030	And king Hezekiah and the princes then said to the Levites to sing praises unto the Lord with the words of David, and of Assaph the seer. And they sang praises with great joy, and they bowed their heads and prostrated themselves.
014	2CH	029	031	Then commenced Hezekiah, and said, Now have ye consecrated yourselves unto the Lord: come near and bring sacrifices and thanksgiving-offerings unto the house of the Lord. And the assembly brought in sacrifices and thanksgiving-offerings, and every one who was liberal of heart, burnt-offerings.
014	2CH	029	032	And the number of the burnt-offerings, which the assembly brought, was seventy bullocks, one hundred rams, [and] two hundred sheep: as a burnt-offering unto the Lord were all these.
014	2CH	029	033	And the hallowed sacrifices were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.
014	2CH	029	034	Only the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt-offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites assisted them, till the work was ended, and until the other priests could sanctify themselves, for the Levites were of upright heart to sanctify themselves more than the priests.
014	2CH	029	035	But there were also burnt-offerings in abundance, with the fat of the peace-offerings, and the drink-offerings for the burnt-offerings. So was [again] established the service of the house of the Lord.
014	2CH	029	036	And Hezekiah rejoiced, with all the people, over that which God had prepared for the people; because the thing occurred suddenly.
014	2CH	030	001	Then sent Hezekiah to all Israel and Judah, and he also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the Lord at Jerusalem, to prepare the passover-sacrifice unto the Lord the God of Israel.
014	2CH	030	002	And the king held a consultation, as also his princes, and all the assembly in Jerusalem, to prepare the passover-sacrifice in the second month.
014	2CH	030	003	For they were not able to prepare it at that time; because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, nor had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.
014	2CH	030	004	And the thing seemed right in the eyes of the king and in the eyes of all the assembly.
014	2CH	030	005	So they established a decree to cause a proclamation to be made throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba' even as far as Dan, that they should come to prepare the passover-sacrifice unto thy Lord the God of Israel at Jerusalem; because for a long time past they had not prepared it as it was written,
014	2CH	030	006	So the runners went with the letters from the hand of the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the command of the king, saying, O children of Israel, return unto the Lord the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the power of the kings of Assyria.
014	2CH	030	007	And be net like your fathers, and like your brethren, who acted faithlessly against the Lord the God of their fathers, wherefore he gave them up to become an [object of] astonishment, as ye see.
014	2CH	030	008	Now do ye not harden your necks, like your fathers: hold out your hand unto the Lord, and come unto his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever, and serve the Lord your God, and so will he turn away from you the fierceness of his wrath.
014	2CH	030	009	For If ye return unto the Lord, your brethren and your children will find mercy in the presence of their captors, so that they may return to this land; for the Lord your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his countenance from you, if ye return unto him.
014	2CH	030	010	And as the runners were passing from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Menasseh and as far as Zebulun, they were laughing them to scorn, and mocking at them.
014	2CH	030	011	Nevertheless some men of Asher and Menasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.
014	2CH	030	012	Also over Judah came the hand of God to give unto them one heart to do the command of the king and of the princes, by the word of the Lord.
014	2CH	030	013	And there was gathered together at Jerusalem a numerous people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great assembly.
014	2CH	030	014	And they arose and removed the altars which were in Jerusalem, and all the vessels for burning incense did they take away, and they threw them into the brook Kidron.
014	2CH	030	015	And they slaughtered the passover-sacrifice on the fourteenth day of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought burnt-offerings unto the house of the Lord.
014	2CH	030	016	And they stood on their station after their prescribed manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God, the priest sprinkling the blood, [which they received] out of the hand of the Levites.
014	2CH	030	017	For there were many in the assembly that had not sanctified themselves: therefore the Levites had the charge of the slaughtering of the passover sacrifices for every one that was not clean, to sanctify [the same] unto the Lord.
014	2CH	030	018	For a large portion of the people, even many out of Ephraim, and Menasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, but ate the passover not as it is written. However Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The Lord who is good will grant pardon for this.
014	2CH	030	019	To every one that hath directed his heart to seek God, the Lord the God of his fathers; though he be not [cleansed] according to the purification of the sanctuary.
014	2CH	030	020	And the Lord hearkened to Hezekiah, and he healed the people.
014	2CH	030	021	And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem celebrated the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great joy; and the Levites and the priests praised the Lord day by day, with loud instruments before the Lord.
014	2CH	030	022	And Hezekiah spoke comfortingly unto all the Levites that had good intelligence of the Lord: and they ate the festive-offerings during seven days, offering peace-offerings, and making confession to the Lord the God of their fathers.
014	2CH	030	023	And the whole assembly took counsel to celebrate other seven days: and they celebrated [these] seven days with joy.
014	2CH	030	024	For Hezekiah king of Judah had provided for the assembly one thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes had provided for the assembly one thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and the priests sanctified themselves in great numbers.
014	2CH	030	025	And thus rejoiced all the assembly of Judah, and the priests and the Levites, and all the assembly that was come out of Israel, and the strangers that were come out of the land of Israel, and those that dwelt in Judah.
014	2CH	030	026	And there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David the king of Israel had the like not been in Jerusalem.
014	2CH	030	027	Then arose the priests the Levites and blessed the people: and their voice was listened to, and their prayer came to His holy dwelling-place, even unto heaven.
014	2CH	031	001	And when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and broke in pieces the statues, and cut down the groves, and pulled down the high-places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, and in Ephraim and Menasseh, until they had made an end of them all. Then returned all the children of Israel every man to his possession, to their own cities.
014	2CH	031	002	And Hezekiah stationed the divisions of the priests and the Levites after their divisions, every man according to his service, of the priests and the Levites, for burnt-offerings and for peace-offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the camps of the Lord.
014	2CH	031	003	The king also gave a portion from his own property for the burnt-offerings, [namely,] for the morning and evening burnt-offerings, and the burnt-offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new-moons, and for the appointed feasts, as it is written in the law of the Lord.
014	2CH	031	004	Moreover he said to the people, to those who dwelt in Jerusalem, to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, in order that they might hold firmly to the law of the Lord.
014	2CH	031	005	And when the matter was spread abroad, the children of Israel brought in abundance the first-fruits of corn, of the new wine, and of oil, and of honey, and of all the products of the field: and the tithe of all things did they bring [likewise] in abundance.
014	2CH	031	006	And as for the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were hallowed unto the Lord their God, and gave [them] by heaps.
014	2CH	031	007	In the third month did they begin to lay the foundation of the heaps, and in the seventh month did they finish them.
014	2CH	031	008	And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the Lord, and his people Israel.
014	2CH	031	009	Then made Hezekiah inquiry of the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.
014	2CH	031	010	Then spoke to him 'Azaryahu the chief priest of the house of Zadok, and said, Since it was begun to bring the heave-offerings into the house of the Lord, there hath been enough to eat, and to leave in great abundance; for the Lord hath blessed his people: and that which is left is this great mass.
014	2CH	031	011	Then ordered Hezekiah to prepare chambers in the house of the Lord: and they prepared them.
014	2CH	031	012	And they brought in the heave-offerings, and the tithes, and the sanctified things, in faithfulness: and over them were appointed the ruler Conanyahu the Levite, and Shim'i his brother the second in rank.
014	2CH	031	013	And Jechiel, and 'Azazyahu, and Nachath, and 'Assahel, and Jerimoth. and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Yissmachyahu, and Machath, and Benayahu, were overseers under the supervision of Conanyahu and Shim'i his brother, by the appointment of king Hezekiah, and 'Azazyahu the ruler of the house of God.
014	2CH	031	014	And Kore the son of Yimnah the Levite, the gatekeeper at the east side. was over the freewill-offerings of God, to give [to him] the heave-offerings of the Lord, and the most holy things.
014	2CH	031	015	And under his supervision were 'Eden, and Minyamin, and Jeshua', and Shema-yahu, Amaryahu, and Shechanyahu, in the cities of the priests, in faithfulness, to give to their brethren after the divisions, equally to the great as to the small;
014	2CH	031	016	Besides [these] to those recorded by their genealogies of males, from three years old and upward, of all that entered into the house of the Lord, the daily portion on its day, for their service in their charges according to their divisions.
014	2CH	031	017	And likewise to the priests recorded by their genealogies after their family divisions, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their charges by their divisions;
014	2CH	031	018	And to those recorded by their genealogies of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, of all the assembly; for in their faithfulness they devoted themselves in the sanctuary.
014	2CH	031	019	Also of the sons of Aaron the priests, who were in the fields of the open districts of their cities, in each and every city, there were men, expressed by name, who had to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all that were recorded by their genealogies among the Levites.
014	2CH	031	020	And the like did Hezekiah in all Judah, and he did what is good and right and true before the Lord his God.
014	2CH	031	021	And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he acted with all his heart, and prospered.
014	2CH	032	001	After these things and veritable events came Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and invaded Judah, and encamped against the fortified cities, and thought to break them open for himself.
014	2CH	032	002	And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was coming, and that his face [was directed] for war against Jerusalem,
014	2CH	032	003	He consulted with his princes and his mighty men to stop up the waters of the springs which were without the city: and they helped him.
014	2CH	032	004	And there were gathered together a very numerous body of people, and they stopped up all the springs, and the brook that flowed through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?
014	2CH	032	005	Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall where it was broken down, and heightened the towers, and [built] without another wall, and fortified the Millo of the city of David, and made weapons in abundance and shields.
014	2CH	032	006	And he appointed war-officers over the people, and gathered them together unto him in the open place at the gate of the city, and spoke comfortingly to them, saying,
014	2CH	032	007	Be strong and of good courage, do not fear and be not dismayed because of the king of Assyria, and because of all the multitude that is with him; for with us there is One greater than with him:
014	2CH	032	008	With him there is an arm of flesh; but with us is the Lord our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people relied upon the words of Hezekiah the king of Judah.
014	2CH	032	009	After this did Sennacherib the king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, while he was himself lying before Lachish, and all [the chief troops of] his dominion with him, against Hezekiah the king of Judah, and against all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,
014	2CH	032	010	Thus hath said Sennacherib the king of Assyria, On what do ye trust, that ye remain besieged in Jerusalem?
014	2CH	032	011	Doth not Hezekiah mislead you to give you up to die by famine and by thirst, when he saith, The Lord our God will deliver us out of the grasp of the king of Assyria?
014	2CH	032	012	Is it not this Hezekiah that hath removed his high-places and his altars, when he said to Judah and to Jerusalem, saying, Before one altar shall ye prostrate yourselves, and upon it shall ye burn incense?
014	2CH	032	013	Know ye not what I have done, I and my fathers, unto all the people of [other] lands? were the gods of the nations of those lands at all able to deliver their land out of my hand?
014	2CH	032	014	Who among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed, was it, that was able to deliver his people out of my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand?
014	2CH	032	015	And now let not Hezekiah deceive you, and let him not mislead you in this manner, nor believe him; for no god of any nation or kingdom whatever was able to deliver his people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less will you Gods, deliver you out of my hand!
014	2CH	032	016	And yet more did his servants speak against the Lord God, and against his servant Hezekiah.
014	2CH	032	017	He wrote also letters to blaspheme against the Lord the God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of [other] lands, who have not delivered their people out of my hand, so will the God of Hezekiah not deliver his people out of my hand.
014	2CH	032	018	Then did they call out with a loud voice in the Jewish language unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to frighten them, and to terrify them: in order that they might capture the city.
014	2CH	032	019	And they spoke of the God of Jerusalem, as concerning the gods of the nations of the earth, the work of the hands of man.
014	2CH	032	020	And king Hezekiah and Isaiah the son of Amos the prophet prayed for this cause, and they cried to heaven.
014	2CH	032	021	And the Lord sent an angel, who cut off every mighty man of valor and leader and captain in the camp of the king of Assyria: and when he was returned with shame of face to his own land, he went into the house of his god, and [those] that were come forth from his own bowels felled him there with the sword.
014	2CH	032	022	Thus did the Lord save Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem out of the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and out of the hand of all, and guided them [safely] on every side.
014	2CH	032	023	And many brought presents unto the Lord to Jerusalem, and precious things to Hezekiah the king of Judah: so that he was exalted before the eyes of all the nations after that time.
014	2CH	032	024	In those days fell Hezekiah sick to the death; and he prayed unto the Lord: and he spoke unto him, and he gave him a wonderful token.
014	2CH	032	025	But not according to the mercy shown unto him did Hezekiah act in return; for his heart was lifted up: wherefore there came wrath over him, and over Judah and Jerusalem.
014	2CH	032	026	Then became Hezekiah humbled because of the lifting up of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and the wrath of the Lord came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.
014	2CH	032	027	And Hezekiah had riches and honor in exceeding abundance; and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of costly vessels;
014	2CH	032	028	And storehouses for the produce of corn, and new wine, and oil; and stalls for all kinds of cattle, and sheepfolds for flocks.
014	2CH	032	029	Moreover he erected for himself cities, and [acquired] possessions of flocks and herds in multitude; for God had given him wealth in great abundance.
014	2CH	032	030	This same Hezekiah also stopped up the upper mouth of the waters of Gichon, and brought them straight down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.
014	2CH	032	031	And in the same manner in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to inquire concerning the wonder that had happened in the land, God left him, to prove him, to know all that was in his heart.
014	2CH	032	032	And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his pious deeds, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, the prophet, [and] in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
014	2CH	032	033	And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the highest place of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem showed him honor at his death. And Manasseh his son became king in his stead.
014	2CH	033	001	Twelve years old was Manasseh when he became king, and fifty and five years did he reign in Jerusalem.
014	2CH	033	002	And he did what is evil in the eyes of the Lord, after the abominable acts of the nations whom the Lord had driven out from before the children of Israel.
014	2CH	033	003	And he built again the high-places which Hezekiah his father had broken down, and he erected altars for the Be'alim, and made Asheroth, and bowed himself down to all the host of heaven, and served them.
014	2CH	033	004	And he built altars in the house of the Lord, whereof the Lord had said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.
014	2CH	033	005	And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord.
014	2CH	033	006	And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of Ben-hinnom: he also observed times, and employed enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with [those of] a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he did much that is evil in the eyes of the Lord, to provoke him to anger.
014	2CH	033	007	And he placed a carved image of the idol which he had made in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have made choice of out of all the tribes of Israel, will I place my name for ever.
014	2CH	033	008	Nor will I any more remove the foot of Israel from off the land which I have appointed for your fathers; but only if they will take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.
014	2CH	033	009	But Menasseh led Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem astray, to do worse than the nations whom the Lord had destroyed from before the children of Israel.
014	2CH	033	010	And the Lord spoke to Menasseh, and to his people; but they listened not.
014	2CH	033	011	Wherefore the Lord brought over them the captains of the army belonging to the king of Assyria: and they took Menasseh prisoner with chains, and bound him with fetters, and led him off to Babylon.
014	2CH	033	012	And when he was in distress, he besought the Lord his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers.
014	2CH	033	013	And he prayed unto him, and he permitted himself to be entreated by him, and heard his supplication, and brought him back to Jerusalem, unto his kingdom. Then did Menasseh feel conscious that the Lord is indeed the [true] God.
014	2CH	033	014	And after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gichon, in the valley, even to the entrance of the fish-gate, and about the hill-fort, and raised it up to a very great height; and he placed captains of the army in all the fortified cities of Judah.
014	2CH	033	015	And he removed the strange gods and the idol out of the house of the Lord, and all the altars that he had built on the mount of the house of the Lord, and in Jerusalem, and he cast them forth to without the city.
014	2CH	033	016	And he rebuilt the altar of the Lord, and sacrificed thereupon peace-offerings and thanksgiving-offerings, and he ordered Judah to serve the Lord the God of Israel.
014	2CH	033	017	Nevertheless the people sacrificed on the high-places, but only unto the Lord their God.
014	2CH	033	018	And the rest of the acts of Menasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spoke to him in the name of the Lord the God of Israel, behold, they are in the history of the kings of Israel.
014	2CH	033	019	His prayer also, and [how God] was entreated of him, and all his sins and his faithlessness, and the places whereon he built high-places, and set up the Asherim and the graven images, before he was humbled: behold, they are written in the history of Chozai.
014	2CH	033	020	And Menasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house. And Amon his son became king in his stead.
014	2CH	033	021	Two and twenty years old was Amon when he became king, and two years did he reign in Jerusalem.
014	2CH	033	022	And he did what is evil in the eyes of the Lord, as Menasseh his father had done; and unto all the carved images which Menasseh his father had made did Amon sacrifice, and them he served;
014	2CH	033	023	But he did not humble himself before the Lord, as Menasseh his father had humbled himself; for he, Amon, made his guiltiness great.
014	2CH	033	024	And his servants conspired against him, and put him to death in his own house.
014	2CH	033	025	But the people of the land slew all those that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.
014	2CH	034	001	Eight years old was Josiah when he became king, and thirty and one years did he reign in Jerusalem.
014	2CH	034	002	And he did what is right in the eyes of the Lord, and walked in the ways of David his father, and turned not aside to the right or to the left.
014	2CH	034	003	And in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet a lad, he began to seek after the God of David his father; and in the twelfth year he began to purify Judah and Jerusalem from the high-places, and the Asherim, and the carved images, and the molten images.
014	2CH	034	004	And they broke down in his presence the altars of the Be'alim, and the sun-images, that were set above them, he cut down; and the Asherim, and the carved images, and the molten images, he broke in pieces, and ground down, and strewed [the same] upon the graves of those that had sacrificed unto them.
014	2CH	034	005	And the bones of priests did he burn upon their altars; and he purified Judah and Jerusalem.
014	2CH	034	006	And [so did he] in the cities of Menasseh and Ephraim and Simeon, even as far as Naphtali, with their mattocks, round about.
014	2CH	034	007	And when he had broken down the altars and had beaten the Asherim and the graven images into powder, and cut down all the sun-images throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.
014	2CH	034	008	And in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purified the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azalyahu, and Ma'asseyahu the governor of the city and Joach the son of Joachaz the recorder, to repair the house of the Lord his God.
014	2CH	034	009	And they came to Chilkiyahu the high-priest, and gave up the money that had been brought into the house of God, which the Levites that watched at the threshold had gathered from the hand of Menasseh and Ephraim, and from all the remnant of Israel, and from all Judah and Benjamin, and were returned to Jerusalem.—
014	2CH	034	010	And they delivered it into the hand of those who overlooked the workmen that had been appointed as overseers of the house of the Lord: and those who overlooked the workmen, who did the work in the house of the Lord, gave it out, to repair and to restore the house,
014	2CH	034	011	And they gave it to the carpenters and to the builders to buy hewn stone and timber for joists, and to lay the beams in the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.
014	2CH	034	012	And the men acted faithfully in the work: and over them were appointed Jachath and 'Obadyahu, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kehathites, to supervise; and every one of these Levites was skilful on instruments of music.
014	2CH	034	013	They were also over the bearers of burdens and supervisors over all that did the work in every manner of service: and from the Levites there were also scribes, and officers, and gatekeepers.
014	2CH	034	014	And when they took out the money that had been brought into the house of the Lord, Chilkiyahu the priest found the book of the law of the Lord through the hand of Moses.
014	2CH	034	015	Then commenced Chilkiyahu and said to Shaphan the scribe, The book of the law have I found in the house of the Lord. And Chilkiyahu gave the book to Shaphan.
014	2CH	034	016	And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king also word back again, saying, All that was put in the hand of thy servants, have they truly done.
014	2CH	034	017	And they have taken out the money that was found in the house of the Lord, and have delivered it into the hand of the appointed overseers, and into the hand of those who overlook the workmen.
014	2CH	034	018	Then told Shaphan the scribe the king, saying, A book hath Chilkiyahu the priest given me. And Shaphan read in it before the king.
014	2CH	034	019	And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes.
014	2CH	034	020	And the king commanded Chilkiyahu, and Achikam the son of Shaphan, and 'Abdon the son of Michah, and Shaphan the scribe, and 'Assayah a servant of the king's, saying,
014	2CH	034	021	Go ye, inquire of the Lord in my behalf, and in behalf of those that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that hath been found; for great is the fury of the Lord that is poured out against us, because our fathers did not keep the word of the Lord, to do in accordance with all that is written in this book.
014	2CH	034	022	Then went Chilkiyahu with those whom the king [had appointed], to Chuldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Thoknath, the son of Chassrah, the keeper of the wardrobe; —now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the suburb; —and they spoke to her in that wise.
014	2CH	034	023	And she said unto them, Thus hath said the Lord the God of Israel, Say unto the man that hath sent you to me,
014	2CH	034	024	Thus hath said the Lord, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon its inhabitants, all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah;
014	2CH	034	025	Because they have forsaken me, and have burnt incense unto other gods, in order to provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands: therefore is my fury poured out upon this place, and it shall not be quenched.
014	2CH	034	026	And with respect to the king of Judah, who sendeth you to inquire of the Lord, thus shall ye say to him, Thus hath said the Lord the God of Israel, Concerning the words which thou hast heard;
014	2CH	034	027	Because thy heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardst his words against this place, and against its inhabitants, and didst humble thyself before me, and rend thy clothes, and weep before me: I have also truly heard it, saith the Lord.
014	2CH	034	028	Behold, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy graves in peace, and thy eyes shall not look on all the evil which I am bringing over this place, and over its inhabitants. And they brought the king word again.
014	2CH	034	029	And the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
014	2CH	034	030	And the king went up into the house of the Lord, with all the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, from the great to the small; and he read before their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which had been found in the house of the Lord.
014	2CH	034	031	And the king stood up on his stand, and he made a covenant before the Lord, to walk after the Lord, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that are written in this book.
014	2CH	034	032	And he caused to accede to it every one that was present in Jerusalem and Benjamin. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem acted in accordance with the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.
014	2CH	034	033	And Josiah removed all the abominations out of all the countries that belonged to the children of Israel, and caused all that were present in Israel to serve, even to serve the Lord their God. All his days did they not depart from following the Lord God of their fathers.
014	2CH	035	001	And Josiah kept in Jerusalem the passover unto the Lord: and they slaughtered the passover-sacrifice on the fourteenth day of the first month.
014	2CH	035	002	And he placed the priests in their charges, and strengthened them for the service of the house of the Lord.
014	2CH	035	003	And he said unto the Levites that instructed all Israel, who were holy unto the Lord, Set the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David the king of Israel did build; you have not to carry it any more upon your shoulders; now serve the Lord your God, and his people Israel.
014	2CH	035	004	And prepare yourselves by your family divisions, according to your courses, after the written order of David the king of Israel, and after the written order of Solomon his son;
014	2CH	035	005	And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the family divisions of your brethren the sons of the people, and after the division of the families of the Levites;
014	2CH	035	006	And slaughter the passover-sacrifice, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare it for your brethren, to do according to the word of the Lord by the hand of Moses.
014	2CH	035	007	And Josiah set apart for the sons of the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for the passover-sacrifices, for all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and of steers three thousand: these were of the king's property.
014	2CH	035	008	And his princes set apart [much] as a freewill gift for the people for the priests, and for the Levites: Chilkiyah, and Zecharyahu, and Jechiel, the rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover-sacrifices two thousand and six hundred [lambs and kids], and three hundred steers.
014	2CH	035	009	And Conanyahu, and Shema'yahu and Nethanel, his brothers, and Chashabyahu and Je'iel and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, set apart unto the Levites for passover-sacrifices five thousand [lambs and kids], and five hundred steers.
014	2CH	035	010	So the service was established, and the priests stood on their station, and the Levites in their divisions, according to the king's command.
014	2CH	035	011	And they slaughtered the passover-sacrifice, and the priests sprinkled [the blood received] from their hands, and the Levites did the flaying.
014	2CH	035	012	And they removed the burnt-offerings to give them to the divisions of the family divisions of the sons of the people, to offer [them] unto the Lord, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so did they with the steers.
014	2CH	035	013	And they roasted the passover by the fire in accordance with the prescribed manner; but the holy offerings they seethed in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and divided them speedily among all the sons of the people.
014	2CH	035	014	And afterward they prepared for themselves, and for the priests; because the priests the sons of Aaron [were busied] in offering the burnt-offerings and the fat until night: therefore the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests the sons of Aaron.
014	2CH	035	015	And the singers the sons of Assaph were on their station, according to the command of David, and Assaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the gatekeepers were at every gate: they had no need to depart from their service; because their brethren the Levites prepared for them.
014	2CH	035	016	So was established all the service of the Lord on the same day, to prepare the passover-sacrifice, and to offer burnt-offerings upon the altar of the Lord, according to the command of king Josiah.
014	2CH	035	017	And the children of Israel that were present prepared the passover-sacrifice at that time, and [kept] the feast of unleavened bread seven days.
014	2CH	035	018	And there was not holden any passover like this in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; and all the kings of Israel did not keep such a passover as Josiah kept, with the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
014	2CH	035	019	In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover holden.
014	2CH	035	020	After all this, when Josiah had restored the temple, came up Necho the king of Egypt to fight against Karkemish by the Euphrates, and Josiah went out against him.
014	2CH	035	021	But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day, but against the house wherewith I have war, and God hath commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from meddling with God who is with me, that he may not destroy thee.
014	2CH	035	022	Nevertheless did Josiah not turn his face away from him, but disguised himself, to fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God; and he came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.
014	2CH	035	023	And the archers shot at king Josiah: and the king said to his servants, Carry me away: for I am sorely wounded.
014	2CH	035	024	And his servants carried him away out of that chariot, and conveyed him in the second chariot that he had: and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.
014	2CH	035	025	And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah; and all the singing men and the singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and they instituted them as a custom in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the lamentations.
014	2CH	035	026	And the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his pious deeds, in accordance with what is written in the law of the Lord,
014	2CH	035	027	And his acts, the first and the last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
014	2CH	036	001	And the people of the land took Jehoachaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father's stead in Jerusalem.
014	2CH	036	002	Twenty and three years old was Joachaz when he became king, and three months did he reign in Jerusalem.
014	2CH	036	003	And the king of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem, and imposed a fine on the land of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
014	2CH	036	004	And the king of Egypt made Elyakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoyakim. And Joachaz his brother did Necho take away, and bring him to Egypt.
014	2CH	036	005	Twenty and five years old was Jehoyakim when he became king, and eleven years did he reign in Jerusalem: and he did what is evil in the eyes of the Lord his God.
014	2CH	036	006	Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and he bound him with fetters, to carry him away to Babylon.
014	2CH	036	007	And some of the vessels of the house of the Lord did Nebuchadnezzar carry to Babylon, and he placed them in his temple at Babylon.
014	2CH	036	008	And the rest of the acts of Jehoyakim, and his abominable deeds which he did, and that which was found concerning him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. And Jehoyachin his son became king in his stead.
014	2CH	036	009	Eight years old was Jehoyachin when he became king, and three months and ten days did he reign in Jerusalem: and he did what is evil in the eyes of the Lord.
014	2CH	036	010	And with the expiration of the year did king Nebuchadnezzar send and had him brought to Babylon, with the costly vessels of the house of the Lord: and he made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem,
014	2CH	036	011	Twenty and one years old was Zedekiah when he became king, and eleven years did he reign in Jerusalem.
014	2CH	036	012	And he did what is evil in the eyes of the Lord his God: he humbled himself not before Jeremiah the prophet, according to the order of the Lord.
014	2CH	036	013	And also against king Nebuchadnezzar did he rebel, who had made him swear by God; but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart so as not to return unto the Lord the God of Israel.
014	2CH	036	014	Also all the chiefs of the priests and the people committed manifold trespasses, like all the abominable acts of the [foreign] nations: and they defiled the house of the Lord which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.
014	2CH	036	015	And the Lord the God of their fathers sent to them by means of his messengers, making [them] rise early, and sending [them]: because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling-place;
014	2CH	036	016	But they mocked at the messengers of God, and despised his words, and scorned his prophets, until the fury of the Lord arose against his people, till there was no remedy.
014	2CH	036	017	And he brought over them the king of the Chaldeans, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or virgin, the old man, and the aged: all did he give up into his hand.
014	2CH	036	018	And all the vessels of the house of God, the great and the small, and the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king and of his princes, —all these did he carry to Babylon.
014	2CH	036	019	And they burnt the house of God, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem, and all her palaces they burnt with fire, and all her costly vessels they gave up to destruction.
014	2CH	036	020	And those that had escaped from the sword did he carry into exile to Babylon: and they were servants to him and to his sons until the kingdom of Persia came to the government:
014	2CH	036	021	To fulfill the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had satisfied its sabbaths: all the days of its desolation it rested, till seventy years were completed.
014	2CH	036	022	And in the first year of Cyrus the king of Persia, at the completion of the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah, did the Lord stir up the spirit of Cyrus the king of Persia, so that he caused a proclamation to be made throughout all his kingdom, and also by means of writing, saying,
014	2CH	036	023	Thus hath said Cyrus the king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath the Lord the God of heaven given me, and he hath charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, may the Lord his God be with him, and let him go up.

015	EZR	001	001	And in the first year of Cyrus the king of Persia, at the time the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah was accomplished, the Lord awakened the spirit of Cyrus the king of Persia; and he caused a proclamation to be made throughout all his kingdom, and also by means of writing, saying,
015	EZR	001	002	Thus hath said Cyrus the king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath the Lord the God of heaven given unto me; and he hath directed me to build for him a house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.
015	EZR	001	003	Whoever among you that is of all his people, may his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the Lord the God of Israel, he is the God who is in Jerusalem.
015	EZR	001	004	And whosoever remaineth out of any place where he hath sojourned, him shall the men of his place assist with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God which is in Jerusalem.
015	EZR	001	005	Then rose up the chiefs of the divisions of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all those whose spirit God had awakened, to go up to build the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem.
015	EZR	001	006	And all those that were round about them supplied them with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, beside all that was willingly offered.
015	EZR	001	007	Also king Cyrus brought forth the vessels of the house of the Lord, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought away out of Jerusalem, and had placed in the house of his god:
015	EZR	001	008	Even these did Cyrus the king of Persia bring forth through the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and counted them out unto Sheshbazzar the prince for Judah.
015	EZR	001	009	And this is their number: Thirty chargers of gold, a thousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives,
015	EZR	001	010	Thirty cups of gold, silver cups of a second degree four hundred and ten, other vessels a thousand.
015	EZR	001	011	All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred. All these did Sheshbazzar bring up with the exiles that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem.
015	EZR	002	001	Now these are the children of the province who went up out of the captivity of the exiles, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away into exile unto Babylon, and who returned unto Jerusalem and Judah, every one unto his city;

015	EZR	002	058	All the temple-servants, and the children of Solomon's servants, were three hundred and ninety and two.
015	EZR	002	059	And these are those who went up from Thel-melach, Thelcharsha, Kerub, Addan, and Immer; but they could not tell their family division, and their descent, whether they were of Israel:
015	EZR	002	060	The children of Delayah the children of Tobiyah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred fifty and two.
015	EZR	002	061	And of the children of the priests: The children of Chabayah, the children of Hakkoz, the children of Barzillai, who had taken a wife from the daughters of Barzillai the Gil'adite, and was called after their name.
015	EZR	002	062	These sought for their family-registers, but they were not found: wherefore they were excluded, as unfit, from the priesthood.
015	EZR	002	063	And the Thirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there should stand up a priest with the Urim and Thummim.
015	EZR	002	064	The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and sixty.
015	EZR	002	065	Besides their men-servants and their maid-servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: they had also two hundred singing men and singing women.
015	EZR	002	066	Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six; their mules, two hundred forty and five;
015	EZR	002	067	Their camels, four hundred thirty and five; their asses, six thousand seven hundred and twenty.
015	EZR	002	068	And some of the chiefs of the divisions, when they came to the house of the Lord which is at Jerusalem, offered freewill gifts for the house of God to set it up in its place:
015	EZR	002	069	After their ability they gave unto the treasure for the work sixty and one thousand drachms of gold, and five thousand manehs of sliver, and one hundred coats for the priests.
015	EZR	002	070	And the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and the singers, and the gate-keepers, and the temple-servants, dwelt in their cities, and all Israel in their cities.
015	EZR	003	001	And when the seventh month drew near, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem.
015	EZR	003	002	Then arose Jeshua' the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealthiel, and his brethren, and they built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer thereon burnt-offerings, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.
015	EZR	003	003	And they erected the altar upon its foundations; for there was fear upon them because of the people of these countries; and they offered thereon burnt-offerings unto the Lord, burnt-offerings at morning and at evening.
015	EZR	003	004	And they celebrated the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and [offered] the daily burnt-offerings by number, according to the prescribed manner, the offering of every day on its day;
015	EZR	003	005	And afterward the continual burnt-offering, and that for the new moons, and for all the feasts of the Lord that are hallowed, and that of every one who willingly offered a free-will offering unto the Lord.
015	EZR	003	006	From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt-offerings unto the Lord: although the foundation of the temple of the Lord had not yet been laid.
015	EZR	003	007	Then did they give money unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and food, and drink, and oil, unto the Zidonians and Tyrians, to bring cedar-trees from the Lebanon by sea to Joppa, according to the permission of Cyrus the king of Persia for them.
015	EZR	003	008	And in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, did Zerubbabel the son of Shealthiel and Jeshua' the son of Jozadak, and the remainder of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem make a beginning; and they appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to superintend the work of the house of the Lord.
015	EZR	003	009	Then stood forward Jeshua' with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, as one man, to superintend the workmen in the house of God; [also] the sons of Chenadad, their sons and their brethren the Levites.
015	EZR	003	010	And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the Lord, they placed the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Assaph with cymbals, to praise the Lord, after the manner of David the king of Israel.
015	EZR	003	011	And they sang responsively in praise and thanksgiving unto the Lord; because he is good, for unto everlasting endureth his kindness toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, while praising the Lord; because the foundation of the house of the Lord had been laid.
015	EZR	003	012	But many of the priests and Levites and chiefs of the divisions, the aged, who had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice, while many, shouting for joy, raised aloud their voice:
015	EZR	003	013	So that the people could not distinguish the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people; for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard ever so far off.
015	EZR	004	001	Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the exile were building the temple unto the Lord the God of Israel:
015	EZR	004	002	Then came they near to Zerubbabel, and to the chiefs of the divisions, and said unto them, Let us build with you; for like you will we seek your God; and unto him do we sacrifice since the days of Essar-chaddon the king of Asshur, who hath brought us up hither.
015	EZR	004	003	But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua', and the rest of the of the divisions of Israel, said unto them, It is not obligatory on you and on us to build a house unto our God; but we ourselves together must build unto the Lord the God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.
015	EZR	004	004	Then did the people of the land weaken the hands of the people of Judah, and frightened them off from building;
015	EZR	004	005	And they hired against them counsellors, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus the king of Persia, and even until the reign of Darius the king of Persia.
015	EZR	004	006	And in the reign of Achashverosh, in the beginning of his reign they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.
015	EZR	004	007	And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes the king of Persia: and the writing of the letter was written in Aramic, and interpreted in Aramic.
015	EZR	004	008	Rechum the counsellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a certain letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king, as followeth:
015	EZR	004	009	Then [wrote] Rechum the counsellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions, from Din, and Apharsathach, Tarpel, Apharass, Erech, Babylon, Shushan, Dehav, and 'Elam,
015	EZR	004	010	And the rest of the nations whom the great and honored Assnapper had brought into exile, and settled in the cities of Samaria, and the rest that are on this side the river, and so forth.
015	EZR	004	011	This is the copy of the letter which they sent unto him, even unto king Artaxerxes: Thy servants the men on this side the river, and so forth.
015	EZR	004	012	Be it made known unto the king, that the Jews who removed away from thee are come up to us unto Jerusalem: they are building the rebellious and the bad city, and are completing the walls, and are joining together the foundations.
015	EZR	004	013	Be it now known unto the king, that, if this city be rebuilt, and the walls be completed, they will not give tax, tribute, and toll, and the royal revenues will suffer damage.
015	EZR	004	014	Now because we eat the salt of the palace, and it is not proper for us to see the king's dishonor, therefore have we sent and let the king know this:
015	EZR	004	015	That search may be made in the book of the memorable events of thy fathers, and thou wilt find in the book of the memorable events, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have practised sedition within the same from the most ancient time; for which cause this city was destroyed.
015	EZR	004	016	We let the king know that, if this city be rebuilt, and its walls be completed, by this means thou wilt have no more any portion on this side of the river.
015	EZR	004	017	Then sent the king a reply unto Rechum the counsellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and unto the rest of those beyond the river, Peace, and so forth.
015	EZR	004	018	The letter which ye have sent unto us hath been plainly read before me.
015	EZR	004	019	And an order was given by me, and search was made, and it was found that this city from the most ancient time hath lifted itself up against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been practised therein.
015	EZR	004	020	And that mighty kings have been over Jerusalem, who ruled over all the countries beyond the river; and that tax, tribute, and toll was given unto them.
015	EZR	004	021	Now give ye the order to stop these men, and this city shall not be built, until the order be given from me.
015	EZR	004	022	Take heed now that ye commit no error in this: that not any injury may grow [out of this] to the damage of the kings.
015	EZR	004	023	Thereupon so soon as the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rechum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they did go up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and stopped them by force and power.
015	EZR	004	024	Then was stopped the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem, and it remained interrupted until the second year of the reign of Darius the king of Persia.
015	EZR	005	001	Then prophesied Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of 'Iddo, the prophets, unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem, in the name of the God of Israel, concerning them.
015	EZR	005	002	Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealthiel, and Jeshua' the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is in Jerusalem; and with them were the prophets of God helping them.
015	EZR	005	003	At this same time came to them Thathnai, the governor on this side of the river, and Shethar-bozenai, and their companions, and thus they said unto them, “Who hath given you an order to build this house, and to complete these walls?”
015	EZR	005	004	Then said we unto them after this manner, what are the names of the men that erect this building.
015	EZR	005	005	But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, so that they did not stop them, till the matter came to Darius; and they then returned an answer by letter concerning this.
015	EZR	005	006	A copy of the letter which Thathnai, the governor on this side of the river, and Shethar-bozenai, and his companions, the Apharsachites, who were on this side of the river, sent unto king Darius.
015	EZR	005	007	They sent a report unto him, and thus was it written therein: Unto king Darius be all peace.
015	EZR	005	008	Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judah, to the house of the great God, which they are building with heavy stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work is urged with speed, and it prospereth in their hands.
015	EZR	005	009	Then asked we these elders, and after this manner said we unto them, Who hath given you the order to build this house, and to complete these walls?
015	EZR	005	010	Also their names did we ask of them, to let thee know them, that we might write down the names of the men that are at their head.
015	EZR	005	011	And in this manner did they return us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we build the house that was built before this many years, and a great king of Israel built and completed it.
015	EZR	005	012	But since our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them up into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, and he destroyed this house, and carried the people as exiles into Babylon.
015	EZR	005	013	However, in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon, king Cyrus gave an order to build this house of God.
015	EZR	005	014	And also the vessels of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought into the temple of Babylon, these did king Cyrus take out of the temple of Babylon, and gave them unto one, Sheshbazzar by name, whom he had appointed as governor;
015	EZR	005	015	And he said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple which is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be built on its site.
015	EZR	005	016	Then came this same Sheshbazzar, [and] laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jerusalem; and from that time even until now they have been building it, but it is not yet finished.
015	EZR	005	017	And now, if it seem good to the king, let search be made in the king's treasure-house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that an order was given by king Cyrus to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send to us his pleasure concerning this matter.
015	EZR	006	001	Then gave king Darius an order, that they should make search in the house of the books, where the treasures were laid up there in Babylon.
015	EZR	006	002	And there was found at Achmetha, in the castle that is in the province of Media, a roll, and therein was thus written: A record.
015	EZR	006	003	In the first year of king Cyrus, king Cyrus gave an order concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house be built, the place where they used to offer sacrifices, and let its foundations be strongly laid: its height shall be sixty cubits, its breadth sixty cubits,
015	EZR	006	004	With three rows of heavy stones, and a row of new timber; and let the expenses be given out of the king's house.
015	EZR	006	005	And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took away out of the temple which is in Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought back unto the temple which is in Jerusalem, every one to its place, and let them be put in the house of God.
015	EZR	006	006	Now Thathnai, governor beyond the river, Shethar-bozenai, and your companions the Apharsachites, who are beyond the river, be ye far from there:
015	EZR	006	007	Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God on its site.
015	EZR	006	008	And by me is the order given what ye shall do to the elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God, that out of the king's property, arising out of the tax beyond the river, the expenses shall forthwith be given unto these men, that they be not hindered.
015	EZR	006	009	And what they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt-offerings unto the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the requirement of the priests who are a Jerusalem, shall be given unto them day by day, without fail.
015	EZR	006	010	That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savors unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king and of his sons.
015	EZR	006	011	Also is by me the order given, that if any man should alter this command, timber shall be pulled down from his house, and being set up, he shall be hanged thereon; and his house shall be made a dunghill for this.
015	EZR	006	012	And may the God that causeth his name to dwell there cast down every king and people that will stretch forth their hand to alter, to destroy this house of God which is in Jerusalem. I Darius have given the order: let it be done speedily.
015	EZR	006	013	Then did Thathnai the, governor on this aide of the river, Shethar-bozenai, and their companions, in accordance with what king Darius had sent, act in this manner speedily.
015	EZR	006	014	And the elders of the Jews built, and they prospered, through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of 'Iddo. And they built, and completed it, according to the order of the God of Israel, and according to the order of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes the king of Persia.
015	EZR	006	015	And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of king Darius.
015	EZR	006	016	Then celebrated the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the exile, the dedication of this house of God with joy;
015	EZR	006	017	And they offered for the dedication of this house of God one hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin-offering for all Israel, twelve he-goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.
015	EZR	006	018	And they stationed the priests in their orders, and the Levites in their divisions, for the service of God, which is in Jerusalem, as it is written in the book of Moses.
015	EZR	006	019	And the children of the exile prepared the passover-[sacrifice] on the fourteenth day of the first month.
015	EZR	006	020	For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves, as one man were all of them clean; and they slaughtered the passover-sacrifice for all the children of the exile, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.
015	EZR	006	021	And then did the children of Israel, who were returned out of the exile, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the uncleanness of the nations of the earth, to seek the Lord the God of Israel, eat thereof.
015	EZR	006	022	And they celebrated the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy; for the Lord had made them joyful, and had turned the heart of the king of Asshur toward them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.
015	EZR	007	001	And after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes the king of Persia, Ezra the son of Serayah, the son of 'Azaryah, the son of Chilkiyah,
015	EZR	007	002	The son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Achitub,
015	EZR	007	003	The son of Amaryah, the son of 'Azaryah, the son of Merayoth,
015	EZR	007	004	The son of Zerachyah, the son of 'Uzzi, the son of Bukki,
015	EZR	007	005	The son of Abishua', the son of Phinehas, the son of Elazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest:
015	EZR	007	006	This 'Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a practised expounder in the law of Moses, which the Lord the God of Israel hath given; and the king gave him, according to the hand of the Lord his God upon him, all his request.
015	EZR	007	007	And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the gate-keepers, and the temple-servants, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of king Artaxerxes.
015	EZR	007	008	And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king.
015	EZR	007	009	For on the first day of the first month was the commencement of the expedition from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him.
015	EZR	007	010	For 'Ezra had directed his heart to inquire in the law of the Lord, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and ordinances.
015	EZR	007	011	Now this is the copy of the letter which king Artaxerxes gave unto 'Ezra the priest, the expounder of the law, the expounder of the words of the commandments of the Lord, and of his statutes for Israel.
015	EZR	007	012	Artaxerxes, the king of kings, unto 'Ezra the priest, the expounder of the law of the God of heaven, the perfect, and so forth.
015	EZR	007	013	By me is the order given, that every one who is freely willing in my kingdom out of the people of Israel, and their priests and Levites, to go up to Jerusalem, may go up with thee:
015	EZR	007	014	Forasmuch as thou art sent on the part of the king, and of his seven counsellors, to make inquiry concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of thy God which is in thy hand;
015	EZR	007	015	And to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counsellors have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem.
015	EZR	007	016	And all [freewill offerings of] silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill offerings which the people and the priests offer willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem.
015	EZR	007	017	Therefore mayest thou buy speedily with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meat-offerings and their drink-offerings, and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem.
015	EZR	007	018	And whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren, to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do according to the will of your God.
015	EZR	007	019	And the vessels which have been given unto thee for the service of the house of thy God, deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem.
015	EZR	007	020	And the remainder that will yet be needful for the house of thy God, which thou shalt have occasion to procure, procure out of the King's treasure-house.
015	EZR	007	021	And by me, me King Artaxerxes, is the order given unto all the treasurers who are beyond the river, that whatsoever 'Ezra the priest, the expounder of the law of the God of heaven, may demand of you, shall be done speedily.
015	EZR	007	022	Up to one hundred talents of silver, and up to one hundred cors of wheat, and up to one hundred baths of wine, and up to one hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing it.
015	EZR	007	023	Whatsoever is ordered by the God of heaven shall be carefully done for the house of the God of heaven; for why should there be wrath against the kingdom of the king and his sons?
015	EZR	007	024	And to you make we it known, that on any of the priests and Levites, singers, gate-keepers, and temple-servants, or ministers of this house of God, no one shall be empowered to impose any tax, tribute, or toll.
015	EZR	007	025	And thou, 'Ezra, according to the wisdom of thy God which is in thy hand, appoint judges and magistrates, who are to judge all the people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and make ye them known to those that know them not.
015	EZR	007	026	And if there be any one who will not execute the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let justice be speedily executed upon him, whether it be unto death or to banishment, or to a fine on goods, or to imprisonment.
015	EZR	007	027	Blessed be the Lord the God of our fathers, who hath put the like of this in the heart of the king, to glorify the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem;
015	EZR	007	028	And who hath extended kindness unto me before the king and his counsellors, and before all the mighty princes of the king: and I strengthened myself according to the hand of the Lord my God upon me, and I gathered together out of Israel principal men to go up with me.
015	EZR	008	001	Now these are the chiefs of their divisions, and this is the genealogy of those that went up with me, in the reign of king Artaxerxes, from Babylon.
015	EZR	008	002	Of these sons of Phinehas, Gershom; of the sons of Ithamar, Daniel; of the sons of David, Chattush;
015	EZR	008	003	Of the sons of Shechanyah, [who was] of the sons of Par'osh, Zechariah; and with him were recorded by genealogy of males one hundred and fifty.
015	EZR	008	004	Of the sons of Pachath-moab, Elyeho'enai the son of Zerachyah, and with him were two hundred males.
015	EZR	008	005	Of the sons of Shechanyah, the son of Yachaziel, and with him were three hundred males.
015	EZR	008	006	And of the sons of 'Adin, 'Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him were fifty males.
015	EZR	008	007	And of the sons of 'Elam, Jesha'yah the son of 'Athalyah, and with him were seventy males.
015	EZR	008	008	And of the sons of Shephatyath, Zebadyah the son of Michael, and with him were eighty males.
015	EZR	008	009	Of the sons of Joab, 'Obadiah the son of Jechiel, and with him were two hundred and eighteen males.
015	EZR	008	010	And of the sons of Shelomith, the son of Jossiphyah, and with him were one hundred and sixty males.
015	EZR	008	011	And of the sons of Bebai, Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with him were twenty and eight males.
015	EZR	008	012	And the sons of 'Azgad, Jochanan the son of Hakkatan, and with him were one hundred and ten males.
015	EZR	008	013	And of the sons of Adonikam the last; and those are their names, Eliphelet, Je'iel, and Shema'yah, and with them were sixty males.
015	EZR	008	014	And of the sons of Bigvai, 'Uthai, and Zabbur, and with them were seventy males.
015	EZR	008	015	And I gathered them together to the river that runneth into the Ahava, and we encamped there three days: and I looked about among the people, and the priests, but of the sons of Levi I found none there.
015	EZR	008	016	Then sent I for Eli'ezer, for Ariel, for Shema'yah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, the head men; also for Joyarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding.
015	EZR	008	017	And I sent them with a charge unto Iddo the chief at the place Cassiphia, and I laid the words in their mouth to speak unto Iddo, and to his brother, who were appointed at the place Cassiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God.
015	EZR	008	018	And they brought unto us according to the good hand of our God upon us a man of intelligence, of the sons of Machli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel, namely, Sherebyah, with his sons and his brothers, eighteen;
015	EZR	008	019	And Chashabyah, and with him Jesha'yah of the sons of Merari, his brothers and their sons, twenty.
015	EZR	008	020	Also of the temple-servants, whom David and the princes had assigned for the service of the Levites two hundred and twenty temple-servants, all of whom were expressed by names.
015	EZR	008	021	Then did I proclaim a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to request from him a prosperous journey for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.
015	EZR	008	022	For I was ashamed to ask of the king an army and horsemen to assist us against an enemy on the way; because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all those that seek him for good; but his power and his wrath are against all those that forsake him.
015	EZR	008	023	So we fasted and besought our God for this, and he suffered himself to be entreated by us.
015	EZR	008	024	Then set I apart of the chiefs of the priests twelve persons, Sherebyah, Chashabyah, and with them ten of their brethren.
015	EZR	008	025	And I weighed out unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, the offering for the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors, and his princes, and all Israel there present, had offered.
015	EZR	008	026	And I weighed out into their hand of silver six hundred and fifty talents, and of silver vessels one hundred talents, of gold one hundred talents;
015	EZR	008	027	Also twenty cups of gold, of a thousand drachms; and two vessels of fine polished copper, valuable as gold.
015	EZR	008	028	And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto the Lord; and the vessels are holy; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto the Lord the God of your fathers.
015	EZR	008	029	Watch ye, and guard them, until ye weigh them out before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites, and the chiefs of the divisions of Israel, at Jerusalem, into the chambers of the house of the Lord.
015	EZR	008	030	And the priests and the Levites accepted what was weighed out of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring the same to Jerusalem to the house of our God.
015	EZR	008	031	And we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was over us, and he delivered us from the hand of any enemy, and of such as lie in wait on the way.
015	EZR	008	032	And we came to Jerusalem, and remained there three days.
015	EZR	008	033	And on the fourth day were the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed out in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriyah the priest; and with him was El'azar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua', and No'adyah the son of Binnui, the Levites;
015	EZR	008	034	By number and by weight of everything: and all the weight was written down at the same time.
015	EZR	008	035	Those that came out of the captivity, the children of the exile, offered burnt-offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven sheep, twelve he-goats for a sin-offering: all as burnt-offerings unto the Lord.
015	EZR	008	036	And they delivered the king's commands unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors on this side of the river; and these endowed the people, and the house of God.
015	EZR	009	001	Now when these things were accomplished, the princes approached me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the nations of the lands, notwithstanding their abominations, from the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the 'Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Emorites;
015	EZR	009	002	For they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons; and the holy seed have mingled themselves with the nations of these lands; and the hand of the princes and rulers hath been the first in this trespass.
015	EZR	009	003	And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and I plucked out some of the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down astounded.
015	EZR	009	004	And then assembled themselves unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the trespass of the exiles; and I sat astounded until the evening sacrifice.
015	EZR	009	005	And at the evening sacrifice I rose up from my fasting, and while rending my garment and my mantle, I knelt down upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto the Lord my God.
015	EZR	009	006	And I said, O my God, I am ashamed and confounded to lift up my face unto thee, my God! for our iniquities are increased above our head, and our guiltiness is grown up as far as the heavens.
015	EZR	009	007	From the days of our fathers have we been in a great guiltiness even until this day; and through our iniquities have we been delivered, we, our kings, and our priests, into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to the shame of face, as it is this day.
015	EZR	009	008	And now for a little moment hath grace been extended from the Lord our God, to preserve us a remnant to escape, and to give us a stake in his holy place, that our God might enlighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.
015	EZR	009	009	For we are bondmen: yet in our bondage hath our God not forsaken us, but hath extended unto us kindness before the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to exalt the house of our God, and to erect again its ruins, and to give us a fence in Judah and in Jerusalem.
015	EZR	009	010	And now what shall we say, O our God, after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments,
015	EZR	009	011	Which thou hast commanded through means of thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which ye go to take possession thereof, is a land defiled through the defilement of the nations of the lands, through their abominations, with which they have filled it from one end to another through their uncleanness.
015	EZR	009	012	And now your daughters shall ye not give unto their sons, and their daughters shall ye not take for your sons, and ye shall not seek their peace and their welfare unto eternity: in order that ye may be strong, and eat the best of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children unto eternity.
015	EZR	009	013	And after all that is come over us for our evil deeds, and for our great guiltiness, seeing that thou our God hast spared us [punishing us] less than our iniquities [deserved], and hast given us such deliverance as this:
015	EZR	009	014	Should we again make void thy commandments, and make marriage with these people of abominations? wouldst thou not be angry with us even to make an end of us, so that there would not be any remnant or escape?
015	EZR	009	015	O Lord, God of Israel, thou art righteous; for we have been left a remnant that hath escaped, as it is this day; behold, we are before thee in our guiltiness; for there is no standing before thee because of this.
015	EZR	010	001	Now when 'Ezra prayed, and when he made his confession, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there gathered themselves unto him out of Israel a very large assembly of men and women and children; for the people wept exceedingly much.
015	EZR	010	002	Thereupon commenced Shechanyah the son of Jechiel, of the sons of 'Elam, and said unto 'Ezra, we have indeed trespassed against our God, and have brought home strange wives of the nations of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing.
015	EZR	010	003	And now let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the direction of the Lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God: and let it be done according to the law.
015	EZR	010	004	Arise; for this matter is obligatory upon thee; and we will be with thee: be strong, and do it.
015	EZR	010	005	Then arose 'Ezra, and caused the princes of the priests, the Levites, and of all Israel, to swear to do according to this word. And they swore.
015	EZR	010	006	Then arose 'Ezra from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Jochanan the son of Elyashib; and he went thither without having eaten bread, or having drunk water; for he was mourning because of the trespass of the exiles.
015	EZR	010	007	And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the exile, to gather themselves together at Jerusalem;
015	EZR	010	008	And that whosoever should not come within three days, according to the resolve of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be devoted, and himself separated from the congregation of the exiles.
015	EZR	010	009	Then were all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered together unto Jerusalem within three days: it was in the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month; and all the people sat in the open place before the house of God, trembling because of this matter, and by reason of the showers of rain.
015	EZR	010	010	And 'Ezra the priest rose up, and said unto them, Ye have acted unfaithfully, and have brought home strange wives, to increase yet more the guiltiness of Israel.
015	EZR	010	011	Now therefore make confession unto the Lord the God of your fathers, and do his will; and separate yourselves from the nations of the earth, and from the strange wives.
015	EZR	010	012	Then answered all the assembly and said with a loud voice, So be it: according to thy word it is our duty to do.
015	EZR	010	013	But the people are many, and it is the rainy season, and we have not the strength to remain in the street, nor is this a work for one day or for two days; for we are many that have transgressed in this matter.
015	EZR	010	014	Let however our princes stand forward for all the congregation, and let all those in our cities who have brought home strange wives come at appointed times, and with them the elders of each and every city, and its judges, until the fierce wrath of our God be turned away from us for this whole matter.
015	EZR	010	015	Only Jonathan the son of 'Assahel and Jachzeyah the son of Thikvah withstood this [proposal]: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite assisted them.
015	EZR	010	016	And the children of the exile did so. And then were set apart 'Ezra the priest, [and] certain chiefs of the divisions, for their family divisions, and all of them [designated] by their names; and they sat down on the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.
015	EZR	010	017	And they made an end with all, with the men that had brought home strange wives, not before the first day of the first month.
015	EZR	010	018	And there were found among the sons of the priests that had brought home strange wives, namely, of the sons of Jeshua' the son of Jozadak, and his brethren: Ma'asseyah, and Eli'ezer, and Jarib, and Gedalyah.
015	EZR	010	019	And they gave their hand to put away their wives, and being guilty, [they offered] a ram of the flock for their trespass.
015	EZR	010	020	And of the sons of Immer: Chanani, and Zebadyah.
015	EZR	010	021	And of the sons of Charim: Ma'asseyah, and Elijah, and Shema'yah, and Jechiel, and 'Uzziyah.
015	EZR	010	022	And of the sons of Pashchur: Elyo'enai, Ma'asseyah. Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad, and El'assah.
015	EZR	010	023	Also of the Levites: Jozabad, and Shim'i, and Kelayan, the same is Kelita, Pethachyah, Judah, and Eli'ezer.
015	EZR	010	024	And of the singers, Elyashib; and of the gate-keepers, Shallum, and Telem, and Uri.
015	EZR	010	025	And of Israel: Of the sons of Par'osh, Ramyah, and Yizziyah, and Malkiyah, and Miyamin, and El'azar, and Malkiyah, and Benayah.
015	EZR	010	026	And of the sons of 'Elam; Matthanyah, Zecharyah, and Jechiel, and 'Abdi, and Jeremoth, and Eliyah.
015	EZR	010	027	And of the sons of Zatthu: Elyo'enai, Elyashib, Matthanyah, and Jeremoth, and Zabad, and 'Aziza.
015	EZR	010	028	And of the sons of Bebai: Jehochanan, Chananyah, Zabbai, and 'Athlai.
015	EZR	010	029	And of the sons of Bani: Meshullam, Malluch, and 'Adayah, Jashub, and Sheal, and Ramoth.
015	EZR	010	030	And of the sons of Pachath-moab: 'Adna, and Kelal, Benayah, Ma'asseyah, Matthanyah, Bezalel, and Binnui, and Menasseh.
015	EZR	010	031	And of the sons of Charim: Eli'ezer, Yishiyah, Malkiyah, Shema'yah, Shim'on,
015	EZR	010	032	Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemaryah.
015	EZR	010	033	Of the sons of Chashum: Matthenai, Matthathah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Menasseh, and Shim'i.
015	EZR	010	034	Of the sons of Bani: Ma'adai, 'Amram, and Uel,
015	EZR	010	035	Benayah, Bedeyah, Keluhu,
015	EZR	010	036	Vanyah, Meremoth, Elyashib,
015	EZR	010	037	Matthanyah, Matthenai, and Ja'assai,
015	EZR	010	038	And Bani, and Binnui, and Shim'i,
015	EZR	010	039	And Shelemyah, and Nathan, and 'Adayah,
015	EZR	010	040	Machnadbai, Shashai, Sharai,
015	EZR	010	041	'Asar'el, and Shelemyahu, Shemaryah,
015	EZR	010	042	Shallum, Amaryah, and Joseph.
015	EZR	010	043	Of the sons of Nebo: Je'iel, Matthithyah, Zabad, Zebina, Jaddai, and Joel, Benayah.
015	EZR	010	044	All these had taken strange wives; and some of them had wives by whom they had children.

# BOOK	016	NEH	Nehemiah	Nehemiah
016	NEH	001	001	The words of Nehemiah the son of Chachalyah. And it came to pass in the month Kislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan, the capital,
016	NEH	001	002	That there came Chanani, one of my brethren, himself with certain men of Judah: and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, who were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.
016	NEH	001	003	And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great misery and in disgrace; and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and her gates are burnt with fire.
016	NEH	001	004	And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned some days, and I was fasting, and praying before the God of heaven.
016	NEH	001	005	And I said, I beseech thee, O Lord the God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth the covenant and kindness for those that love him and for those that keep his commandments:
016	NEH	001	006	Let thy ear now be attentive, and thy eyes be open, I entreat thee, to hearken unto the prayer of thy servant, which I am praying this day before thee, by day and by night, in behalf of the children of Israel thy servants, and [as] I confess for the sins of the children of Israel, [with] which we have sinned against thee: yea, I also and my father's house have sinned.
016	NEH	001	007	We have dealt very corruptly toward thee: and we have not kept the commandments, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which thou didst command Moses thy servant.
016	NEH	001	008	Remember, I beseech thee, the word with which thou didst charge Moses thy servant, saying, If ye become truly unfaithful, I will indeed scatter you among the nations.
016	NEH	001	009	But if ye return unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them: [then] though your outcasts should be at the utmost parts of heaven, from there will I gather them, and I will bring them unto the place which I have chosen to let my name dwell there.
016	NEH	001	010	And they are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.
016	NEH	001	011	I beseech thee, O Lord, do let thy ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who are desirous to fear thy name; and grant success, I pray thee, to thy servant this day, and let him find mercy in the sight of this man —But I was butler by the king.
016	NEH	002	001	And it came to pass in the month Nissan, in the twentieth year of king Artaxerxes, that wine [stood] before him; and I took up the wine, and gave it unto the king. But I had never been sad in his presence.
016	NEH	002	002	Then said the king unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing but an illness of heart. Then was I very greatly afraid.
016	NEH	002	003	And I said unto the king, May the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres, lieth ruined, and her gates are consumed by fire?
016	NEH	002	004	Then said the king unto me, For what then dost thou make request? Then did I pray to the God of heaven.
016	NEH	002	005	And I said unto the king, If it seem good to the king, and if thy servant might be pleasing in thy presence, [I desire] that thou wouldst send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may build it.
016	NEH	002	006	And the king said unto me, while the queen was sitting beside him, When is thy journey to be undertaken? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king to let me go; and I indicated to him a time.
016	NEH	002	007	And I said unto the king, If it seem good to the king, let letters be given unto me for the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till the time that I come into Judah;
016	NEH	002	008	Also a letter unto Assaph the keeper of the king's forests, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the fortress which appertaineth to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall move into. And the king gave [them] to me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.
016	NEH	002	009	And [so] came I to the governors beyond the river, and I gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent with me captains of the army and horsemen.
016	NEH	002	010	When Sanballat the Choronite, and Tobiyah the servant, the 'Ammonite, heard of it, it displeased them exceedingly, that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.
016	NEH	002	011	So came I to Jerusalem, and remained there three days.
016	NEH	002	012	Then arose I in the night, I and some few men with me; but I had not told any man what my God had put in my heart to do for Jerusalem: nor was there any beast with me, save the beast on which I rode.
016	NEH	002	013	And I went out through the gate of the valley by night, even toward the direction of the dragon-well, and to the dung-gate; and I was viewing the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates whereof were consumed by fire.
016	NEH	002	014	Then passed I on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's pool; but there was no space for the beast that was under me to pass through.
016	NEH	002	015	Then went I up through the valley in the night, and I was viewing the wall, and I returned and entered through the gate of the valley, and so returned home.
016	NEH	002	016	And the rulers knew not whither I was gone, or what I was doing: nor had I as yet told it to the Jews, and to the priests, and to the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the superintendents of the work.
016	NEH	002	017	Then said I unto them, Ye see the misery in which we are, how Jerusalem lieth in ruins, and its gates are burnt with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we may no more be for a reproach.
016	NEH	002	018	And I told them of the hand of my God, which was good upon me, as also the king's words which he had spoken unto me. And they said, We will rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for the good work.
016	NEH	002	019	But when Sanballat the Choronite, and Tobiyah the servant, the 'Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye are doing? are ye rebelling against the king?
016	NEH	002	020	And I returned them an answer, and said unto them, The God of heaven will indeed give us prosperity, and we his servants will truly rise up and build; but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.
016	NEH	003	001	Then rose up Elyashib the high priest with his brethren the priests, and they built the sheep-gate; they sanctified it, and set up its doors: even as far as the tower of Meah did they sanctify it, as far as the tower of Chananel.
016	NEH	003	002	And by his side built the men of Jericho. And by his [other] side built Zaccur the son of Imri.
016	NEH	003	003	But the fish-gate did the sons of Hassenaah build: they also laid its beams, and set up its doors, its locks, and its bars.
016	NEH	003	004	And alongside of them repaired Meremoth the son of Uriyah, the son of Kakkoz. And alongside of them repaired Meshullam the son of Berechyah, the son of Meshezabel. And alongside of them repaired Zadok the son of Ba'ana.
016	NEH	003	005	And alongside of them repaired the Teko'ites; but their principal men put not their necks to the work of their Lord.
016	NEH	003	006	Moreover the old gate repaired Yoyada' the son of Passeach, and Meshullam the son of Bessodeyah: they laid its beams, and set up its doors, and its locks, and its bars.
016	NEH	003	007	And alongside of them repaired Melatyah the Gib'onite, and Jadon the Meronothite, men of Gib'on and of Mizpah, unto the seat of the governor on this side of the river.
016	NEH	003	008	Alongside of him repaired 'Uzziel the son of Charhayah, of the goldsmiths. And alongside of him repaired Chananyah the son of one of the apothecaries, and they fortified Jerusalem as far as the broad wall.
016	NEH	003	009	And alongside of them repaired Rephayah the son of Chur, the chief of the half of the district of Jerusalem.
016	NEH	003	010	And alongside of them repaired Jedayah the son of Charumaph, and this opposite to his house. And alongside of him repaired Chattush the son of Chashabneyah.
016	NEH	003	011	Another division did Malkiyah the son of Charim, and Chashub the son of Pachathmoab, repair, as also the tower of the ovens.
016	NEH	003	012	And alongside of him repaired Shallum the son of Hallochesh, the chief of the other half of the district of Jerusalem, he and his daughters.
016	NEH	003	013	The gate of the valley repaired Chanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoach: they built it, and set up its doors, its locks, and its bars, and a thousand cubits of the wall as far as the dung-gate.
016	NEH	003	014	And the dung-gate repaired Malkiyah the son of Rechah, the chief of the district of Beth-hakkerem: he built it, and set up its doors, its locks, and its bars.
016	NEH	003	015	And the gate of the fountain repaired Shallum the son of Col-chozeh, the chief of the district of Mizpah: he built it and covered it, and set up its doors, its locks, and its bars, and the wall of the pool of Shelach by the king's garden, and as far as the stairs that lead down from the city of David.
016	NEH	003	016	Next to him repaired Nehemiah the son of 'Azbuk, the chief of the half district of Beth-zur, as far as the place opposite to the sepulchres of David, and as far as the pool that was [newly] made, and as far as the house of the mighty men.
016	NEH	003	017	Next to him repaired the Levites: Rechum the son of Bani. Alongside of him repaired Chashabyah, the chief of the half district of Ke'ilah, for his district.
016	NEH	003	018	Next to him repaired their brethren: Bavai the son of Chenadad, the chief of the [other] half district of Ke'ilah.
016	NEH	003	019	And there repaired alongside of him 'Ezer the son of Joshua, the chief of Mizpah, another division, opposite to the ascent to the armory at the angle.
016	NEH	003	020	Next to him did Baruch the son of Zaccai' earnestly repair another division, from the angle as far as the door of the house of Elyashib the high priest.
016	NEH	003	021	Next to him repaired Meremoth the son of Uriyah the son of Hakkoz another division, from the door of the house of Elyashib even as far as the end of the house of Elyashib.
016	NEH	003	022	And next to him repaired the priests, the men of the plain [of Jordan].
016	NEH	003	023	Next to him repaired Benjamin and Chashub opposite to their house. Next to him repaired 'Azaryah the son of Ma'aseyah the son of 'Ananyah alongside of his house.
016	NEH	003	024	Next to him repaired Binnui the son of Chenadad another division, from the house of 'Azaryah as far as the angle, and as far as the corner.
016	NEH	003	025	Palal the son of Uzai [repaired] from opposite to the angle, and the tower which standeth out from the king's upper house, that was by the court of the prison. Next to him Pedayah the son of Par'osh.
016	NEH	003	026	And the temple-servants dwelt on the hill fort, [and they built] as far as opposite to the water-gate toward the east, and the tower that standeth out.
016	NEH	003	027	Next to them repaired the Teko'ites another division from opposite the great tower that standeth out, and as far as the wall of the hill fort.
016	NEH	003	028	From above the horse-gate repaired the priests, every one opposite to his house.
016	NEH	003	029	Next to this repaired Zadok the son of Immer opposite to his house. And next to him repaired Shema'yah the son of Schechanyah, the keeper of the east gate.
016	NEH	003	030	Next to him repaired Chananyah the son of Shelemyah, and Chanun the sixth son of Zalaph another division. Next to him repaired Meshullam the son of Berechyah opposite to his chamber.
016	NEH	003	031	Next to him repaired Malkiyah the goldsmith's son as far as the house of the temple-servants, and of the merchants, opposite to the mustering-gate, and to the upper chamber of the corner.
016	NEH	003	032	And between the upper chamber of the corner and the sheep-gate repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants.
016	NEH	004	001	And it came to pass, when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, that it displeased him, and he became very angry, and he mocked at the Jews.
016	NEH	004	002	And he spoke before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What are these feeble Jews doing? will people suffer them [to build]? will they sacrifice? will they complete it in one day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish, seeing that they have been burnt?
016	NEH	004	003	And Tobiyah the 'Ammonite was near him, and he said, Even what they are building, if a fox were to run up, he would readily break through their stone wall.
016	NEH	004	004	Hear, O our God! how we are become a scorn; and bring their reproach back upon their own head, and give them up for prey in the land of captivity.
016	NEH	004	005	And cover not up their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee; for they have taunted [us] in the presence of the builders.
016	NEH	004	006	But we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together up to the half thereof; for the people had a heart to work.
016	NEH	004	007	And it came to pass, when Sanballat and Tobiyah, and the Arabians, and the 'Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were restored, and that the breaches began to be closed up, that it displeased them greatly.
016	NEH	004	008	And they conspired all of them together to come to fight against Jerusalem, and to do it an injury.
016	NEH	004	009	But we prayed unto our God, and set a watch over them day and night, because of the others.
016	NEH	004	010	And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of the burden is failing, and there is much rubbish; and we are not able to build on the wall.
016	NEH	004	011	And our adversaries said, “They shall not know, nor see until we come in the midst of them, and slay them, and so stop the work.”
016	NEH	004	012	And it came to pass, when the Jews who dwelt near them came, that they said unto us ten times, “From all places whence ye may return home [they intend to come] over us.”
016	NEH	004	013	I placed therefore on the lower parts of the place on the naked rocks behind the wall—there I placed the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.
016	NEH	004	014	And I looked [about], and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not afraid of them: think on the Lord, the great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.
016	NEH	004	015	And it came to pass, that, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, God frustrated their counsel: and we returned, all of us, to the wall, every one unto his work.
016	NEH	004	016	And it came to pass from that day forth, that the half of my young men wrought at the work, while the other half of them were holding the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the coats of mail; and the princes stood behind all the house of Judah.
016	NEH	004	017	Those that built on the wall, and those that bore burdens, with those that loaded, —every one with one of his hands wrought on the work, and with the other hand held a weapon.
016	NEH	004	018	And the builders had every one his sword fastened around his loins while they were building; and he that blew the cornet stood alongside of me.
016	NEH	004	019	And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work is great and extensive, and we are separated upon the wall, distant one from another.
016	NEH	004	020	In what place [then] ye hear the sound of the cornet, thither must ye assemble unto us: our God will fight for us.
016	NEH	004	021	So we labored at the work, while the half of them were holding the spears from the rising of the morning-dawn till the stars appeared.
016	NEH	004	022	Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his young man lodge within Jerusalem, so that they may be in the night a guard to us, and during the day for the labor.
016	NEH	004	023	And neither I, nor my brothers, nor my young men, nor the men of the guard who followed me—none of us took off our clothes, no one leaving them off even for washing himself.
016	NEH	005	001	And there arose a great outcry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.
016	NEH	005	002	And there were some that said, Our sons, and our daughters, [and] ourselves are many; and we must buy corn, that we may eat, and live.
016	NEH	005	003	And others there were that said, We must pledge our fields, our vineyards, and our houses, that we may buy corn, in the famine.
016	NEH	005	004	And others there were that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tax on our fields and vineyards.
016	NEH	005	005	Yet now our flesh is like the flesh of our brethren, our children are like their children: and, lo, we must force our sons and our daughters to become servants, and some of our daughters are forced [to become so], and our hand is powerless; and our fields and our vineyards belong to others.
016	NEH	005	006	And it displeased me greatly when I heard their complaint and these words.
016	NEH	005	007	Then did I consult with my heart, and I upbraided the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, “Ye exact usury, every one of his brother!” And I brought together a great assembly against them.
016	NEH	005	008	And I said unto them, We have indeed ransomed our brethren the Jews, who had been sold unto the various nations, as far as our means went: and will ye yourselves even sell your brethren, so that they will be sold again unto us? And they remained silent, and found no answer.
016	NEH	005	009	Then said I, The thing is not good which ye are doing: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God, because of the taunting of the nations, our enemies?
016	NEH	005	010	And also I, my brothers, and my young men, have lent them money and corn: I pray you, let us relinquish this loan.
016	NEH	005	011	Give back to them, I pray you, even this day, their fields, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye have lent them.
016	NEH	005	012	Then said they, We will give [all] back, and of them will we require nothing: so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and made them swear, that they would do in accordance with this promise.
016	NEH	005	013	Also my lap did I shake out, and said, So may God shake out every man that performeth not this promise, from his house and of his toil-gotten wealth, and so let him remain shaken out, and empty. And all the assembly said, Amen, and they praised the Lord. And the people did according to this promise.
016	NEH	005	014	Moreover from the day that [the king] had enjoined on me to be governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year up to the two and thirtieth year of king Artaxerxes, [full] twelve years, neither I nor my brothers ate the food of the governor.
016	NEH	005	015	But the former governors that had been before me had made it heavy for the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty shekels of silver: yea, even their young men ruled over the people; but I myself did not act so, because of the fear of God.
016	NEH	005	016	And in the work of this wall also did I labor actively; and we bought not any fields; and all my young men were assembled there by the work.
016	NEH	005	017	Moreover of the Jews and rulers, one hundred and fifty men, besides those that came unto us from the nations that are about us, [ate] at my table.
016	NEH	005	018	And that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep; also birds were prepared for me, and once in ten days all sorts of wine in abundance: yet with all this I required not the food of the governor; because the service lay heavily upon this people.
016	NEH	005	019	Remember for me, my God, for good, all that I have done for this people.
016	NEH	006	001	Now it came to pass, when it came to the hearing of Sanballat, and Tobiyah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, that I had built the wall, and that there was no breach left therein, although up to that time I had not yet set up the doors in the gates.
016	NEH	006	002	That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in Kephirim, in the plain of Ono. But they were thinking of doing me mischief.
016	NEH	006	003	And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, and I cannot come down: why should the work cease, while I leave it lying, and come down to you?
016	NEH	006	004	And they sent unto me after this manner four times; and I answered them after the same manner.
016	NEH	006	005	Then sent Sanballat unto me in like manner the fifth time his young man with an open letter in his hand:
016	NEH	006	006	Therein was written, It hath been heard among the nations, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think of rebelling; wherefore thou art building up the wall; and that thou art to be king unto them, according to these reports.
016	NEH	006	007	And that thou hast also set up prophets to proclaim concerning thee at Jerusalem, saying, He is king in Judah: and now there may be reported to the king something like these words. Now therefore come, and let us take counsel together.
016	NEH	006	008	Then I sent unto him, saying, “There hath been done nothing like these reports of which thou speakest; but out of thy own heart thou inventest them.”
016	NEH	006	009	For they all wished to make us afraid, thinking, Their hands will be withdrawn from the work, so that it will not be done. Now therefore, [O God,] strengthen my hands.
016	NEH	006	010	And I came also into the house of Shema'yah the son of Delayah the son of Mehetabel, who had shut himself up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us lock the doors of the temple; for they are coming to slay thee: yea, in the night are they coming to slay thee.
016	NEH	006	011	And I said, Should a man like me flee? and who is there that is like me, that would go into the temple and live? I will not go in.
016	NEH	006	012	And I perceived that, lo, God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy over me, because Tobiyah and Sanballat had hired him.
016	NEH	006	013	Therefore was he hired, in order that I should become afraid, and do so, and sin, and that it might serve them for an evil report, so that they might cast reproach upon me.
016	NEH	006	014	Think, O my God, of Tobiyah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also of No'adyah the prophetess, and the rest of the prophets, who wished to make me afraid.
016	NEH	006	015	And so was the wall finished on the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days.
016	NEH	006	016	And it came to pass, when our enemies heard this, and all the nations that were about us saw it, that they sank greatly in their own eyes; and they perceived that by the aid of our God had this work been wrought.
016	NEH	006	017	Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah despatched frequently their letters unto Tobiyah, and those of Tobiyah came unto them.
016	NEH	006	018	For many in Judah were sworn friends unto him; because he was the son-in-law of Shechanyah the son of Arach, and Jehochanan his son had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Bercehyah.
016	NEH	006	019	Also his good deeds were they reporting before me, and my words they used to carry out to him: also Tobiyah sent letters to make me afraid.
016	NEH	007	001	And it came to pass, when the wall was built, that I set up the doors; and then were appointed the gatekeepers and the singers and the [other] Levites [to their office].
016	NEH	007	002	And I gave my brother Chanani, and Chananyah the commander of the fortress, charge over Jerusalem; for he was esteemed a faithful man, and one that feared God these many days.
016	NEH	007	003	And I said unto them, The gates of Jerusalem must not be opened until the sun be hot; and while ye stand by, let them shut the doors, and do ye bar them; and station watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one opposite to his house.
016	NEH	007	004	But the city was roomy in space and large: while the people therein were few, and the houses were not yet built.
016	NEH	007	005	Then did my God put it into my heart, and I assembled together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might give in their genealogy; and I found a register of the genealogy of those who were come up at the first, and I found written therein:
016	NEH	007	006	These arc the children of the province, that came up out of the captivity of the exiles, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried into exile, and who returned to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his own city;
016	NEH	007	007	Who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua', Nehemiah, 'Azaryah, Ra'amyah, Nachamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Misspereth, Bigvai, Nechum, Ba'anah. The number of the men of the people of Israel was:
016	NEH	007	008	The children of Par'osh, two thousand one hundred and seventy and two.
016	NEH	007	009	The children of Shephatyah, three hundred seventy and two.
016	NEH	007	010	The children of Arach, six hundred fifty and two.
016	NEH	007	011	The children of Pachath-moab, of the children of Jeshua' and Joab, two thousand and eight hundred and eighteen.
016	NEH	007	012	The children of 'Elam, one thousand two hundred fifty and four.
016	NEH	007	013	The children of Zatthu, eight hundred forty and five.
016	NEH	007	014	The children of Zaccai, seven hundred and sixty.
016	NEH	007	015	The children of Binnui, six hundred forty and eight.
016	NEH	007	016	The children of Bebai, six hundred twenty and eight.
016	NEH	007	017	The children of 'Azgad, two thousand three hundred twenty and two.
016	NEH	007	018	The children of Adonikam, six hundred sixty and seven.
016	NEH	007	019	The children of Bigvai, two thousand sixty and seven.
016	NEH	007	020	The children of 'Adin, six hundred fifty and five.
016	NEH	007	021	The children of Ater of Hezekiah, ninety and eight.
016	NEH	007	022	The children of Chashum, three hundred twenty and eight.
016	NEH	007	023	The children of Bezai, three hundred twenty and four.
016	NEH	007	024	The children of Chariph, one hundred and twelve.
016	NEH	007	025	The children of Gib'on, ninety and five.
016	NEH	007	026	The men of Beth-lechem and Netophah, one hundred eighty and eight.
016	NEH	007	027	The men of 'Anathoth, one hundred twenty and eight.
016	NEH	007	028	The men of Beth-'azmaveth, forty and two.
016	NEH	007	029	The men of Kiryath-ye'arim, Kephirah, and Beeroth, seven hundred forty and three.
016	NEH	007	030	The men of Ramah and Gaba', six hundred twenty and one,
016	NEH	007	031	The men of Michmass, one hundred twenty and two.
016	NEH	007	032	The men of Beth-el and 'Ai, one hundred twenty and three.
016	NEH	007	033	The men of the other Nebo, fifty and two.
016	NEH	007	034	The children of the other 'Elam, one thousand two hundred fifty and four.

016	NEH	007	061	And these were they who came up from Thel-melach, Thelcharsha, Kerub, Addon, and Immer, but they could not tell their family division and their descent, whether they were of Israel.
016	NEH	007	062	The children of Delayah, the children of Tobiyah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred forty and two.

016	NEH	007	064	These sought for their family register, but it was not found: wherefore they were excluded, as unfit, from the priesthood.
016	NEH	007	065	And the Thirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there should stand up a priest with the Urim and Thummim.
016	NEH	007	066	The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and sixty:
016	NEH	007	067	Besides these were their man-servants and their maid-servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and they had two hundred and forty and five singing men and singing women.

016	NEH	007	071	And some of the chiefs of the divisions gave to the treasury of the work, of gold twenty thousand drachms, and of silver two thousand and two hundred manehs.
016	NEH	007	072	And what the rest of the people gave was, of gold twenty thousand drachms, and of silver two thousand manehs, and priests coats sixty and seven.
016	NEH	007	073	So the priests, and the Levites, and the gatekeepers, and the singers, and some of the people, and the temple-servants, and all Israel, dwelt in their cities: and so came round the seventh month, while the children of Israel were in their cities.
016	NEH	008	001	And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the open place which is before the water-gate; and they said unto 'Ezra the expounder that he should bring forward the book of the law of Moses, which the Lord commanded to Israel.
016	NEH	008	002	Then did 'Ezra the priest bring forward the law before the congregation both of men and women, and every one that had understanding to listen [attentively], on the first day of the seventh month;
016	NEH	008	003	And he read therein in the open place which is before the water-gate from the first daylight until midday, before the men and the women, and those that could understand: and the ears of all the people were directed unto the book of the law.
016	NEH	008	004	And 'Ezra the expounder stood upon an elevated stand of wood, which they had made for the purpose: and beside him stood Matthithyah, and Shema', and 'Anayah, and Uriyah, and Chilkiyah, and Ma'asseyah, on his right hand; and on his left, Pedayah, and Mishael, and Malkiyah, and Chashum, and Chashbadanah, Zechariah, [and] Meshullam.
016	NEH	008	005	And 'Ezra opened the book before the eyes of all the people; for he was [standing] higher than all the people; and as he opened it, all the people became silent.
016	NEH	008	006	And 'Ezra blessed the Lord, the great God: and all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting up their hands; and they bowed their heads, and prostrated themselves before the Lord with their faces to the ground.
016	NEH	008	007	Also Jeshua', and Bani, and Sherebyah, Jamin, 'Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiyah, Ma'asseyah, Kelita, 'Azaryah, Jozabad, Chanan, Pelayah, and the Levites, explained to the people the law: while the people remained where they stood.
016	NEH	008	008	So they read in the book, in the law of God distinctly, and exhibiting the sense: so that [the people] understood what was read.
016	NEH	008	009	Then said Nehemiah, that is the Thirshatha, and 'Ezra the priest the expounder, and the Levites that explained to the people, unto all the people, This day is holy unto the Lord your God: mourn not, and weep not. For all the people were weeping, when they heard the words of the law.
016	NEH	008	010	Then said he unto them, Go your way, eat fat things, and drink sweet drinks, and send portions unto him for whom nothing is prepared; for this day is holy unto our Lord: and do not grieve yourselves; but let the joy of the Lord be your stronghold.
016	NEH	008	011	So the Levites quieted all the people, saying, Be still! for the day is holy: and do not grieve yourselves.
016	NEH	008	012	And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send out portions, and to prepare for themselves great joy: because they had understood the words which [the others] had made known unto them.
016	NEH	008	013	And on the second day there gathered themselves together the chiefs of the divisions of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto 'Ezra the expounder, to obtain again intelligence of the words of the law.
016	NEH	008	014	And they found written in the law that the Lord had commanded through means of Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths during the feast in the seventh month.
016	NEH	008	015	And [they ordered] that they should publish and have proclamation made throughout all their cities, and through Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mountain and fetch olive-leaves, and oleaster-leaves, and myrtle-leaves, and palm-leaves, and leaves of the three-leaved myrtle, to make booths, as it is written.
016	NEH	008	016	And the people went forth, and brought them; and they made themselves booths, every one upon his roof, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the open place by the water-gate, and in the open place by the gate of Ephraim.
016	NEH	008	017	And all the congregation that were returned out of the captivity made booths, and dwelt in the booths; for since the days of Jeshua' the son of Nun until that day the children of Israel had not done so. And there was very great joy.
016	NEH	008	018	And he read in the book of the law of God, day by day, from the first day until the last day. And they celebrated the feast seven days, and on the eighth day the solemn assembly, after the prescribed manner.
016	NEH	009	001	And on the twenty and fourth day of this month were the children of Israel assembled with fasting, and in sackclothes, and with earth upon them.
016	NEH	009	002	And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all children of the strangers: and they stood forward and made confession for their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.
016	NEH	009	003	And they stood up in their standing-place, and read in the book of the law of the Lord their God the fourth part of the day; and another fourth part they made confession, and prostrated themselves before the Lord their God.
016	NEH	009	004	Then stood up upon the stairs of the Levites, Jeshua' and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebanyah, Bunni, Sherebyah, Bani, and Kenani, and they cried with a loud voice unto the Lord their God.
016	NEH	009	005	Then said the Levites, Jeshua', and Kadmiel, Bani, Chashabneyah, Sherebyah, Hodiyah, Shebanyah, and Pethachyah, Arise! bless ye the Lord your God from eternity to eternity. And let men bless thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.
016	NEH	009	006	Thou indeed art the Eternal One alone: It is thou that hast made the heavens with all their host, the earth, and all that is upon her, the seas, and all that is in them, and thou givest life to them all; and the host of the heavens bow down before thee.
016	NEH	009	007	Thou art indeed the Lord the [true] God, who didst choose Abram, and bring him forth out of Ur of the Chaldeans, and change his name to Abraham;
016	NEH	009	008	And thou didst find his heart faithful before thee: and thou madest with him the covenant to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Emorites, and the Perizittes, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashite—to give it to his seed: and thou hast performed thy words; for thou art righteous.
016	NEH	009	009	And thou didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and their cry didst thou hear by the Red Sea;
016	NEH	009	010	And thou didst display signs and wonders on Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knewest that they had dealt presumptuously against them; and thou didst [thus] make thyself a name, as it is this day.
016	NEH	009	011	And the sea didst thou divide before them, so that they passed through the midst of the sea on dry land; and their pursuers didst thou throw into the deeps, like a stone in mighty waters.
016	NEH	009	012	And by a pillar of cloud didst thou lead them in the day, and by a pillar of fire in the night, to give light unto them on the way whereon they should go.
016	NEH	009	013	Also on mount Sinai camest thou down, and spokest with them from heaven; and thou gavest them upright ordinances, and truthful laws, good statutes and commandments;
016	NEH	009	014	And thy holy sabbath madest thou known unto them, and commandments, statutes, and a law didst thou enjoin on them, by the hand of Moses thy servant.
016	NEH	009	015	And bread from heaven didst thou give them for their hunger, and water out of the rock broughtest thou forth for them for their thirst; and thou didst order them to go in to take possession of the land concerning which thou hadst lifted up thy hand to give it unto them.
016	NEH	009	016	And they and our fathers acted presumptuously, and hardened their neck, and hearkened not to thy commandments.
016	NEH	009	017	And they refused to obey, and remembered not thy marvelous deeds which thou hadst done with them; but they hardened their neck, and [spoke of] appointing a chief to return to their bondage, in their rebellion; but thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, long-suffering, and abundant in kindness, and forsookest them not.
016	NEH	009	018	Yea, although they had made for themselves a molten calf, and said, 'This is thy god that hath brought thee up out of Egypt,' and had practised great provocations:
016	NEH	009	019	Yet in thy abundant mercies didst thou not forsake them in the wilderness: the pillar of cloud departed not from them by day, to lead them on the way; nor the pillar of fire by night, to give them light on the way whereon they should go.
016	NEH	009	020	And thy good spirit thou gavest to make them intelligent, and thy manna thou withheldest not from their mouth, and water thou gavest them for their thirst.
016	NEH	009	021	And forty years didst thou provide for them in the wilderness; they lacked nothing; their clothes did not wear out; and their feet swelled not.
016	NEH	009	022	Thou gavest them also kingdoms and nations, which thou didst divide into various corners: and they took possession of the land of Sichon, even the land of the king of Cheshbon, and the land of 'Og the king of Bashan.
016	NEH	009	023	And their children didst thou multiply like the stars of heaven, and then broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst ordered their fathers to enter in to take possession of it.
016	NEH	009	024	And the children entered in and took possession of the land; and thou didst humble before them the inhabitants of the land, the Cana'anites, and gavest them up into their hands, with their kings, and the nations of the land, that they might do with them according to their pleasure.
016	NEH	009	025	And they captured fortified cities, and a fat soil; and they took possession of houses full of all good things, hewn-out wells, vineyards, and olive-yards, and fruit trees in abundance; and they ate, and were satisfied, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness.
016	NEH	009	026	Then became they disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their back, and they slew thy prophets who had warned them to bring them back unto thee, and they practised great provocations.
016	NEH	009	027	Thereupon thou gavest them up into the hand of their adversaries, who oppressed them: and in the time of their distress they used to cry unto thee, and thou ever heardest them from heaven; and according to thy abundant mercies thou wast wont to give them helpers, who helped them out of the hand of their adversaries.
016	NEH	009	028	But when [once more] they had rest, they did again evil before thee: wherefore thou didst leave them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had dominion over them; and when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou wast wont to hear them from heaven, and thou didst ever deliver them according to thy mercies many times.
016	NEH	009	029	And thou gavest them warning to bring them back unto thy law: yet they acted presumptuously, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, and sinned against thy ordinances, which a man is to do that he may live through them: and they rendered their shoulder rebellious, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.
016	NEH	009	030	Yet thou gavest them indulgence many years, and didst warn them through thy spirit by means of thy prophets; but they gave no ear: therefore didst thou give them up into the hand of the nations of the lands.
016	NEH	009	031	Yet in thy abundant mercies hast thou not made an entire end of them, and thou hast not forsaken them; for a gracious and merciful God art thou.
016	NEH	009	032	And now, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest the covenant and kindness, let not be esteemed as little before thee all the hardship that hath befallen us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, from the days of the kings of Assyria until this day.
016	NEH	009	033	Nevertheless thou art righteous in all that is come over us; for thou hast acted [according to] truth, but we have done wickedly.
016	NEH	009	034	Also our kings, our priests, and our fathers have not executed thy law, and have not listened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst warn them.
016	NEH	009	035	But they in their kingdom, and in thy abundant goodness which thou hadst given unto them, and in the ample and fat land which thou hadst given up before them, did indeed not serve thee, and they turned not away from their wicked deeds.
016	NEH	009	036	Behold, we are this day servants: and as regardeth the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat its fruit and its good things, behold, we are servants in it;
016	NEH	009	037	And it yieldeth its products in abundance for the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins; also over our bodies have they dominion, and over our cattle [also] at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.
016	NEH	009	038	And because of all this, we make a faithful covenant, and write it down; and on the sealed document are our princes, our Levites, and our priests.
016	NEH	010	001	And with those whose seal was affixed were, Nehemiah the Tirshatha the son of Chachalyah, and Zidkiyah.

016	NEH	010	028	And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the gate-keepers, the singers, the temple-servants, and all those that had separated themselves from the nations of the lands unto the law of God, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, every one having knowledge, and having understanding,
016	NEH	010	029	Held firmly with their brethren, their nobles, and entered into a curse, and into an oath, to walk in the law of God, which was given through means of Moses the servant of God, and to observe and to do all the commandments of the Eternal One, our Lord, and his ordinances and his statutes;
016	NEH	010	030	And that we would not give our daughters unto the people of the land, nor take their daughters for our sons;
016	NEH	010	031	And that if the people of the land should bring wares or any provisions on the sabbath day to sell, we would not buy of them on the sabbath, or on [another] holy day; and that we would leave [the fields without reaping in] the seventh year, and [give up] every loan of hand.
016	NEH	010	032	And we established for us as one of the commandments to impose on ourselves [to give] the third part of a shekel in every year for the service of the house of our God;
016	NEH	010	033	For the shew-bread, and for the continual meat-offering, and for the continual burnt-offering, [for those of] the sabbaths, of the new-moons, for the appointed feasts, and for the holy things, and for the sin-offerings to make an atonement for Israel, and [for] all the work of the house of our God.
016	NEH	010	034	And we, the priests, the Levites, and the people, cast lots concerning the procuring of the wood, to bring it into the house of our God, unto the house of our fathers, at fixed times, year by year, to burn upon the altar of the Lord our God, as it is written in the law;
016	NEH	010	035	And to bring the first-fruits of our ground, and the first-fruits of all fruit of all trees, year by year, unto the house of the Lord;
016	NEH	010	036	And also the first-born of our sons, and for our [unclean] cattle, as it is written in the law, and to bring the first-born of our herds and of our flocks to the house of our God, unto the priests that minister in the house of our God;
016	NEH	010	037	And that we would bring the first portion of our dough, and our heave-offerings, and this of the fruit of all manner of trees, of wine and of oil, to the priests, unto the chambers of the house of our God, and the tithes of our ground unto the Levites; and that these same Levites should be the receivers of the tithes in all the cities of our land-tillage;

016	NEH	010	039	For into the chambers shall the children of Israel and the children of Levi bring the heave-offering of the corn, of the new wine, and the oil, and there shall be the vessels of the sanctuary, and the priests that minister, and the gatekeepers, and the singers: and that we will not forsake the house of our God.
016	NEH	011	001	And the rulers of the people dwelt at Jerusalem: and the rest of the people cast lots, to bring one of every ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city, and the nine parts to [remain] in the [other] cities.
016	NEH	011	002	And the people blessed all the men, that offered themselves voluntarily to dwell at Jerusalem.

016	NEH	011	018	All the Levites in the holy city were two hundred eighty and four.
016	NEH	011	019	And the gatekeepers, Akkub, Talmon and their brethren that watched at the gates, were one hundred seventy and two.
016	NEH	011	020	And the residue of Israel, of the priests, and the Levites, were in all the cities of Judah, every one in his inheritance.
016	NEH	011	021	But the temple-servants dwelt in the hill-fort; and Zicha and Gishpa were over the temple-servants.
016	NEH	011	022	And the overseer of the Levites at Jerusalem was 'Uzzi the son of Bani, the son of Chashabyah, the son of Matthanyah, the son of Micha, one of the sons of Assaph, the singers, over the business of the house of God.
016	NEH	011	023	For the king's command was obligatory on them; and there was a fixed rate for the singers, the requirement of every day on its day.
016	NEH	011	024	And Pethachyah the son of Meshezabel, of the children of Zerach the son of Judah, was at the king's hand in every thing concerning the people.
016	NEH	011	025	And respecting the villages with their fields, some of the children of Judah dwelt at Kiryath-arba' and in its villages, and at Dibon and in its villages, and at Jekabzeel and in its villages.
016	NEH	011	026	And at Jeshua', and at Moladah, and at Beth-phelet,
016	NEH	011	027	And at Chazar-shu'al, and at Beer-sheba' and in its villages,
016	NEH	011	028	And at Ziklag, and at Mechonah and in its villages,
016	NEH	011	029	And at 'En-rimmon, and at Zor'ah, and at Yarmuth,
016	NEH	011	030	Zanoach, 'Adullam, and in their villages, at Lachish and its fields, at 'Azekah and in its villages. And they dwelt from Beer-sheba' as far as the valley of Hinnom.
016	NEH	011	031	And the children of Benjamin [dwelt], beginning from Geba', at Michmash, and 'Ay-ya, and Beth-el, and in their villages,
016	NEH	011	032	'Anathoth, Nob, 'Ananyah,
016	NEH	011	033	Chazor, Ramah, Gittayim.
016	NEH	011	034	Chadid, Zebo'im, Neballat,
016	NEH	011	035	Lod, and Ono, the valley of the carpenters.
016	NEH	011	036	And of the Levites dwelt certain divisions in Judah, and in Benjamin.
016	NEH	012	001	And these are the priests and the Levites that came up with Zerubbabel the son of Shealthiel, and Jeshua': Serayah, Jeremiah, 'Ezra,
016	NEH	012	002	Amaryah, Malluch, Chattush,
016	NEH	012	003	Shechanyah, Rechum, Meremoth,
016	NEH	012	004	'Iddo, Ginnethoy, Abiyah,
016	NEH	012	005	Miyamin, Ma'adyah, Bilgah,
016	NEH	012	006	Shema'yah, and Joyarib, Jed'ayah,
016	NEH	012	007	Sallu, 'Amok, Chilkiyah, Jed'ayah. These were the chiefs of the priests and of their brethren in the days of Jeshua'.
016	NEH	012	008	And the Levites: Jeshua', Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebyah, Judah, and Matthaniah, who was over the songs of thanksgiving, he and his brethren;
016	NEH	012	009	And Bakbukyah and 'Unni, their brethren, were opposite to them in the watches.
016	NEH	012	010	And Jeshua' begat Joyakim, and Joyakim begat Elyashib, and Elyashib begat Joyada'.
016	NEH	012	011	And Joyada' begat Jonathan, and Jonathan begat Jaddua'.
016	NEH	012	012	And in the days of Joyakim were priests, as chiefs of the divisions: Of Serayah, Merayah; of Jeremiah, Chananyah;
016	NEH	012	013	Of 'Ezra, Meshullam; of Amaryah, Jehochanan;
016	NEH	012	014	Of Mellchu, Jonathan; of Shebanyah, Joseph;
016	NEH	012	015	Of Charim, 'Adna; of Merayoth, Chelkai;
016	NEH	012	016	Of 'Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam;
016	NEH	012	017	Of Abiyah, Zichri; of Minyamin, of Mo'adyah, Piltai;
016	NEH	012	018	Of Bilgah, Shammua'; of Shem'ayah, Jehonathan;
016	NEH	012	019	And of Joyarib, Matthenai; of Jeda'yah, 'Uzzi;
016	NEH	012	020	Of Sallai, Kallai; of 'Amok, 'Eber;
016	NEH	012	021	Of Chilkiyah, Chashabyah; of Jeda'yah, Nethanel.
016	NEH	012	022	Of the Levites in the days of Elyashib, Yoyada', and Yochanan, and Jaddua', are written down the chiefs of the divisions: also those of the priests to the reign of Darius the Persian.
016	NEH	012	023	The sons of Levi, the chiefs of the divisions were written down in the book of the chronicles, even until the days of Jochanan the son of Elyashib.
016	NEH	012	024	And the chiefs of the Levites were: Chashabyah, Sherebyah, and Jeshua' the son of Kadmiel, with their brethren opposite to them, to praise and to give thanks, according to the command of David the man of God, section by section.
016	NEH	012	025	Matthanyah, and Bakbukyah, 'Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, 'Akkub, were watching gatekeepers on the watch at the thresholds of the gates.
016	NEH	012	026	These were in the days of Joyakim, the son of Jeshua', the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of 'Ezra the priest, the expounder.
016	NEH	012	027	And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to celebrate the dedication with joy, with thanksgivings, and with singing, cymbals, psalteries, and with harps.
016	NEH	012	028	And there gathered themselves together the sons of the singers, both out of the district round about Jerusalem, and from the villages of Netophah;
016	NEH	012	029	Also from Beth-hagilgal, and out of the fields of Geba' and Azmaveth; for the singers had built themselves villages round about Jerusalem.
016	NEH	012	030	And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and then they purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.
016	NEH	012	031	Then brought I up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and stationed two great companies for thanksgiving, and trains to walk on the right hand upon the wall by the dung-gate;
016	NEH	012	032	And after them walked Hosha'yah, and half of the princes of Judah,
016	NEH	012	033	And 'Azaryah, 'Ezra, and Meshullam,
016	NEH	012	034	Judah, and Benjamin, and Shema'yah, and Jeremiah;
016	NEH	012	035	And of the sons of priests' with trumpets, Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shema'yah, the son of Matthanyah, the son of Michayah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Assaph;
016	NEH	012	036	And his brethren, Shema'yah, and 'Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Ma'ai, Nethanel, and Judah, Chanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God; and 'Ezra the expounder walked before them.
016	NEH	012	037	And over the fountain-gate, and straight before them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, even as far as the water-gate, eastward.
016	NEH	012	038	And the other company for thanksgiving that walked in the opposite direction to them, —this one did I follow, and the half of the people upon the wall, from beyond the tower of the ovens even as far as the broad wall;
016	NEH	012	039	And above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the fish-gate, and the tower of Chananel, and the tower of Meah, even as far as the sheep-gate; and they halted at the prison-gate.
016	NEH	012	040	So did the two companies for thanksgiving place themselves in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me.
016	NEH	012	041	And the priests, Elyakim, Ma'asseyah, Minyamin, Michayah, Elyo'enai, Zechariah, and Chananiah, with trumpets;
016	NEH	012	042	And Ma'asseyah, and Shema'yah, and El'azar, and 'Uzzi, and Jehochanan, and Malkiyah, and 'Elam, and 'Ezer. And the singers sang aloud, with Yisrachyah as their overseer.
016	NEH	012	043	And they sacrificed on that day great sacrifices, and rejoiced; for God had caused them to rejoice with great joy; and also the women and the children rejoiced: so that the [shout of] joy of Jerusalem was heard even at a great distance off.
016	NEH	012	044	And there were appointed at that day certain men as superintendents over the chambers for the treasuries, for the heave-offerings, for the first-fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions according to the law for the priests and the Levites; for Judah had joy on the priests and on the Levites that stood there,
016	NEH	012	045	And kept the charge of their God, and the charge of the purification, and as singers and gatekeepers, according to the command of David, [and] of Solomon his son.
016	NEH	012	046	For in the days of David and Assaph of old there were chiefs of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God.
016	NEH	012	047	And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the gatekeeper, what was required for every day on its day; and they sanctified things for the Levites: and the Levites sanctified [the portion due] for the children of Aaron.
016	NEH	013	001	On that day there was read in the book of Moses before the ears of the people; and there was found written therein, that no 'Ammonite or Moabite should come into the congregation of God for ever;
016	NEH	013	002	Because they had not met the children of Israel with bread and with water, but had hired Bil'am against them, that he should curse them; although our God had changed the curse into a blessing.
016	NEH	013	003	And it tame to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated all the alien mixture from Israel.
016	NEH	013	004	And before this, Elyashib the priest, appointed over the chambers of the house of our God, and a near [of kin] unto Tobiyah,
016	NEH	013	005	Had prepared for him a large chamber, where they had laid in former times the meat-offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was ordained for the Levites, and the singers, and the gatekeepers, and the heave-offering of the priests.
016	NEH	013	006	But during all this I was not at Jerusalem; for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king of Babylon I went back unto the king, and after the lapse of some time I obtained by request [leave] of the king;
016	NEH	013	007	And I came to Jerusalem, and perceived the evil that Elyashib had done for Tobiyah, in preparing for him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.
016	NEH	013	008	And it displeased me greatly: wherefore I cast forth all the household vessels of Tobiyah away out of the chamber.
016	NEH	013	009	And I gave the order, whereupon they cleansed the chambers; and I had brought thither again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat-offering and the frankincense.
016	NEH	013	010	And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given [them]: so that the Levites and the singers, that used to do the work, were fled every one to his field.
016	NEH	013	011	Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why hath the house of God become forsaken? And I gathered them together, and placed them on their posts.
016	NEH	013	012	And all Judah brought the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries.
016	NEH	013	013	And I appointed receivers over the treasuries, Shelemyah the priest and Zadok the scribe, and Pedayah of the Levites; and with them acted Chanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Matthanyah; for they were accounted as faithful, and it was their duty to make a distribution among their brethren.
016	NEH	013	014	Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my pious deeds which I have done for the house of my God, and for those that had charge of it.
016	NEH	013	015	In those days I saw in Judah some treading wine-presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading burdens on asses, as also wine, grapes and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day; and I warned them on the day whereon they sold provisions.
016	NEH	013	016	Also the men of Tyre [that] dwelt therein brought fish and all kinds of wares, and sold [them] on the sabbath unto the children of Judah and in Jerusalem.
016	NEH	013	017	Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this which ye are doing, and profaning [thereby] the sabbath day?
016	NEH	013	018	Did not your fathers act thus, wherefore our God brought over us all this evil, and over this city? and ye bring yet more wrath over Israel by profaning the sabbath.
016	NEH	013	019	And it came to pass, that, when the shadows were lengthened in the gates of Jerusalem before the sabbath, I gave the order, whereupon the gates were locked, and I ordered that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my young men did I place at the gates, that there should be brought in no burden on the sabbath-day.
016	NEH	013	020	But the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside of Jerusalem once or twice.
016	NEH	013	021	Thereupon did I warn them, and said unto them, Why do ye lodge along the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth they came no more on the sabbath.
016	NEH	013	022	And I ordered the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep watch at the gates, to sanctify the sabbath-day. Also this remember unto me, O my God, and shield me according to the abundance of thy kindness.
016	NEH	013	023	In those days also I saw certain Jews that had brought home wives of Ashdod, of 'Ammon, and of Moab:
016	NEH	013	024	And their children spoke partly in the speech of Ashdod, and did not understand to speak in the Jewish language, but according to the language of one or the other people.
016	NEH	013	025	And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked out their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, nor for yourselves.
016	NEH	013	026	Did not Solomon the king of Israel sin by these things? and although among the many nations there was never a king like him, and beloved as he was by his God, and God had placed him as king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did the alien women mislead to sin.
016	NEH	013	027	Shall we then hear it said of you, that ye do all this great evil, to trespass against our God in bringing home alien wives?
016	NEH	013	028	And one of the sons of Joyada', the son of Elyashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Choronite; wherefore I chased him away from me.
016	NEH	013	029	Remember [this] unto them, O my God, because of the defilements of the priesthood, and of the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.
016	NEH	013	030	Thus cleansed I them from all aliens, and I appointed the watches of the priests and the Levites, every one in his work;
016	NEH	013	031	And for the procuring of the wood, at fixed time, and for the first-fruits. Remember this unto me, O my God, for good.

# BOOK	017	EST	Esther	Esther
017	EST	001	001	And it came to pass in the days of Achashverosh, of the same Achashverosh who reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over a hundred and seven and twenty provinces,
017	EST	001	002	In those days, when this king Achashverosh was sitting on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the capital,
017	EST	001	003	That, in the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants, the army of Persia and Media, the nobles and the princes of the provinces who were near him:
017	EST	001	004	When he showed the riches and the glory of his kingdom, and the brilliance [and] the splendor of his greatness, during many days, a hundred and eighty days.
017	EST	001	005	And when these days were completed, the king made unto all the people that were found in Shushan the capital, unto every one, from the great even to the small, a feast of seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace;
017	EST	001	006	[Where were] white, green, and blue [hangings], fastened with cords of fine linen and purple, on rollers of silver and pillars of marble; couches of gold and silver, upon a pavement of green, and white, and yellow, and black marble.
017	EST	001	007	And they gave them to drink in vessels of gold, —the vessels being diverse one from the other, —and the royal wine was in abundance, according to the ability of the king.
017	EST	001	008	And the drinking was, according to the [king's] order, without compulsion; for so had the king enjoined on all the officers of his house, to do according to the pleasure of every man.
017	EST	001	009	Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women, in the royal house which belonged to king Achashverosh.
017	EST	001	010	On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Charbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcass, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of king Achashverosh,
017	EST	001	011	To bring Vashti the queen before the king [ornamented] with the royal crown, to show the people and the princes her beauty; for she was handsome in appearance.
017	EST	001	012	But queen Vashti refused to come at the word of the king brought by the hand of the chamberlains; and the king was very wroth, and his fury burnt in him.
017	EST	001	013	Then said the king to the wise men, who knew [the occurrences of] the times; for so [came] every affair of the king before all acquainted with law and state institutions;
017	EST	001	014	And those next unto him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tharshish, Meress, Marsena, and Memuchan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who could see [at all times] the king's face, who sat in the first rank in the kingdom:
017	EST	001	015	What should according to law be done with queen Vashti; because she had not fulfilled the order of king Achashverosh by the hand of the chamberlains?
017	EST	001	016	Then said Memuchan before the king and the princes, Not against the king alone hath Vashti the queen done wrong, but also against all the princes, and against all the people that are in all the provinces of king Achashverosh.
017	EST	001	017	For the conduct of the queen will go abroad unto all the women, so that they will despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, King Achashverosh ordered Vashti the queen to be brought into his presence, but she came not.
017	EST	001	018	And even this day will the ladies of Persia and Media, who have heard of the conduct of the queen, say this unto all the princes of the king; and there will arise too much contempt and quarrel.
017	EST	001	019	If it please the king, let there go forth a royal order from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that no one transgress it, That Vashti come no more before king Achashverosh: and let the king give her royal dignity unto another that is better than she.
017	EST	001	020	And when the king's decree which he will make shall be published throughout all his kingdom, however great it is: all the wives will show respect to their husbands, unto every one, from the great even to the small.
017	EST	001	021	And the speech was pleasing in the eyes of the king and of the princes; and the king did according to the speech of Memuchan.
017	EST	001	022	And he sent letters unto all the provinces of the king, unto every province according to its writing, and to every people according to its language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, however he may speak according to the language of his people.
017	EST	002	001	After these events, when the fury of king Achashverosh was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what had been decreed concerning her.
017	EST	002	002	Thus said the king's young men, his servants, Let there be sought for the king virgins handsome in appearance;
017	EST	002	003	And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the young virgins, handsome in appearance, unto Shushan the capital, into the house of the women, under the custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women; and let them give them their customary anointings;
017	EST	002	004	And let the maiden who may be pleasing in the eyes of the king become queen instead of Vashti: and the speech was pleasing in the eyes of the king, and he did so.
017	EST	002	005	There was a certain Jew in Shushan the capital, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Yair, the son of Shim'i, the son of Kish, a Benjamite;
017	EST	002	006	Who had been carried away into exile from Jerusalem with the exiles who had been exiled with Jeconyah, the king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried into exile.
017	EST	002	007	And he had brought up Hadassah, that is Esther, the daughter of his uncle; for she had neither father nor mother, and the maiden was beautiful in form and handsome in appearance; and when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai had taken her to himself as a daughter.
017	EST	002	008	And it came to pass, when the king's order and his decree were heard, and when many maidens were brought together unto Shushan the capital, under the custody of Hegai, that Esther also was brought unto the king's house, under the custody of Hegai, the keeper of the women.
017	EST	002	009	And the maiden was pleasing in his eyes, and she obtained favor before him; and he made haste to give her her anointings, with her presents, and the seven maidens, who were selected to be given her, out of the king's house: and he preferred her and her maidens with the best things in the house of the women.
017	EST	002	010	Esther told nothing of her people or of her descent; for Mordecai had charged her that she should not tell.
017	EST	002	011	And day by day did Mordecai walk before the court of the house of women, to ascertain the well-being of Esther, and what would be done with her.
017	EST	002	012	And when the turn of every maiden was come to go in unto king Achashverosh, at the expiration [of the time] that she had been treated according to the custom of the women, twelve months; for so were the days of their anointings accomplished, six months with the oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odors, and with other ointments of the women;
017	EST	002	013	And thus came the maiden unto the king; [and] whatsoever she asked for was given her to go with her out of the house of the women as far as the house of the king.
017	EST	002	014	In the evening she went, and in the morning she returned unto the second house of the women, to the custody of Sha'ashgas, the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the concubines: she used not to come again unto the king, except the king desired for her, and she was called by name.
017	EST	002	015	And when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abichayil, the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her to himself as a daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, said: and Esther obtained grace in the eyes of all those that beheld her.
017	EST	002	016	And Esther was taken unto king Achashverosh, unto his royal house, in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
017	EST	002	017	And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favor before him more than all the virgins; and he placed the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.
017	EST	002	018	And the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, the feast of Esther; and he made a release of taxes to the provinces, and gave presents, according to the ability of the king.
017	EST	002	019	And when virgins were gathered together the second time, then was Mordecai sitting in the king's gate.
017	EST	002	020	[But] Esther had not yet told of her descent nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her; and Esther did [fulfill] the order of Mordecai, equally as when she was under his guardianship.
017	EST	002	021	In those days, while Mordecai was sitting in the king's gate, Bigthan and Theresh, two chamberlains of the king, of those who kept the door, became wroth, and sought to lay [their] hand on king Achashverosh.
017	EST	002	022	And the thing became known to Mordecai, and he told it unto Esther the queen; and Esther said it to the king in the name of Mordecai.
017	EST	002	023	And the thing was inquired into and found true; and they were both of them hanged on a gallows; and it was written in the book of chronicles before the king.
017	EST	003	001	After these events did king Achashverosh make great Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and he advanced him; and he placed his seat above that of all the princes that were with him.
017	EST	003	002	And all the king's servants, that were in the king's gate, bent the knee and prostrated themselves to Haman; for so had the king commanded concerning him; but Mordecai bent not the knee nor prostrated himself.
017	EST	003	003	Then said the king's, servants, who were in the king's gate, unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king's command?
017	EST	003	004	Now it came to pass, when they spoke unto him day by day, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told it to Haman, to see whether the words of Mordecai would be able to stand; for he had told them that be was a Jew.
017	EST	003	005	And when Haman saw that Mordecai bent not the knee, nor prostrated himself to him, Haman became full of fury.
017	EST	003	006	But it appeared too contemptible in his eyes to lay his hand on Mordecai alone: for they had told him of the people of Mordecai: therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout all the kingdom of Achashverosh, the people of Mordecai.
017	EST	003	007	In the first month, that is the month Nissan, in the twelfth year of king Achashverosh, some one cast the Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month [to month], to the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.
017	EST	003	008	Then said Haman unto king Achashverosh, There is one people scattered yet separate among the nations in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are different from those of every people; while they do not execute the laws of the king; and it is no profit for the king to tolerate them.
017	EST	003	009	If it be pleasing to the king, let [a decree] be written to destroy them; and ten thousand talents of silver will I weigh out into the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring [the same] into the king's treasuries.
017	EST	003	010	And the king drew his signet-ring from off his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the adversary of the Jews.
017	EST	003	011	And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, that people also, to do therewith as it seemeth good in thy eyes.
017	EST	003	012	Then were called the king's scribes in the first month on the thirteenth day thereof, and there was written all just as Haman had commanded unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the princes of every people, to every province according to its writing, and to every people according to its language: in the name of king Achashverosh was it written, and it was sealed with the king's signet-ring.
017	EST	003	013	And the letters were sent by the runners unto all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to exterminate all the Jews, from young to old, little ones and women, on one day, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to plunder their property as spoil.
017	EST	003	014	A copy of the writing, to be given out as a law in every province, was published unto all the nations, that they might be ready against that day.
017	EST	003	015	The runners went out with all speed with the king's decree, and the law was given out in Shushan the capital: and the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Shushan was perplexed.
017	EST	004	001	When Mordecai ascertained all that had been done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth [strewed] with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and bitter cry;
017	EST	004	002	And thus he came up to the front of the king's gate; for none dared to enter into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.
017	EST	004	003	And in each and every province, in every place whither the king's decree and his law had reached, there was great mourning for the Jews, with fasting and weeping and wailing; and a sackcloth [strewed] with ashes became the bed of the great.
017	EST	004	004	Then came the maidens of Esther with her chamberlains and told it her; and the queen was exceedingly terrified; and she sent garments to clothe Mordecai, and to remove his sackcloth from him, but he accepted them not.
017	EST	004	005	Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king's chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a charge for Mordecai to know what this was, and why this was.
017	EST	004	006	So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city, which was before the king's gate.
017	EST	004	007	And Mordecai told him all that had happened unto him, and of the fixed sum of money which Haman had promised to weigh out into the treasuries of the king for the Jews, to destroy them.
017	EST	004	008	Also the copy of the writing of the law that had been given out in Shushan to destroy them he gave to him, to show it unto Esther, and to tell her [all], and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, and to make supplication unto him, and to present a request before him for her people.
017	EST	004	009	And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.
017	EST	004	010	And Esther said unto Hatach, and gave him a charge unto Mordecai,
017	EST	004	011	All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do know, that every one, whether man or woman, who should come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is but one law for him, to put him to death, except the one to whom the king should hold out the golden sceptre, for he will be suffered to live; but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days.
017	EST	004	012	And they told Mordecai the words of Esther.
017	EST	004	013	Then said Mordecai to bring this answer back to Esther, Imagine not in thy soul to be able to escape in the king's house out of all the Jews.
017	EST	004	014	For if thou do indeed maintain silence at this time, enlargement and deliverance will arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's house will perish: and who knoweth whether thou hast not for a time like this attained to the royal dignity?
017	EST	004	015	Then said Esther to bring this answer back to Mordecai,
017	EST	004	016	Go, assemble together all the Jews who are now present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, so that ye neither eat nor drink three days, either night or day; also I myself with my maidens will fast in like manner; and then will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law; and if I then perish, I perish.
017	EST	004	017	And Mordecai went about, and did in accordance with all that Esther had charged him.
017	EST	005	001	And it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and placed herself in the inner court of the king's house, opposite the king's apartment; and the king was sitting upon his royal throne in the royal apartment, opposite to the entrance of the house.
017	EST	005	002	And it happened, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained grace in his eyes; and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand; and Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre.
017	EST	005	003	Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is thy request? if it be equal to half of the kingdom it shall still be given thee.
017	EST	005	004	And Esther said, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet which I have prepared for him.
017	EST	005	005	Then said the king, Bring Haman quickly hither to fulfill the word of Esther: so came the king with Haman to the banquet which Esther had prepared.
017	EST	005	006	And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even if it be equal to half of the kingdom, it shall still be done.
017	EST	005	007	Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request are,
017	EST	005	008	If I have found grace in the eyes of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to fulfill my request, that the king may come with Haman to the banquet which I will prepare for them, and tomorrow will I do according to the word of the king.
017	EST	005	009	And Haman went forth on that day joyful and with a glad heart; but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, who did not rise up, nor move out of the way for him, then was Haman filled against Mordecai with fury.
017	EST	005	010	Nevertheless Haman refrained himself, and went to his house: he then sent and had his friends brought in with Zeresh his wife.
017	EST	005	011	And Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had made him great, and how he had advanced him above the princes and the servants of the king.
017	EST	005	012	And Haman said [farther], Yea, Esther the queen did not let any one come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself: and also for tomorrow am I invited unto her with the king.
017	EST	005	013	Yet all this profiteth me nothing, every time that I see Mordecai the Jew sitting in the king's gate.
017	EST	005	014	Then said unto him Zeresh his wife with all his friends, Let them make a gallows of fifty cubits high, and in the mourning speak unto the king that they may hang Mordecai thereon; and then go thou in with the king unto the banquet joyfully. And the thing pleased Haman; and he had the gallows made.
017	EST	006	001	In that night sleep fled from the king, and he ordered to bring in the book of the memorable events of the chronicles; and they were read before the king.
017	EST	006	002	And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Theresh, two chamberlains of the king, of those who kept the door, who had sought to lay [their] hand on king Achashverosh.
017	EST	006	003	And the king said, What honor and distinction have been done to Mordecai for this? Then said the king's young men, his servants, There hath nothing been done with him.
017	EST	006	004	And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into the outer court of the king's house, to say unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows which he had prepared for him.
017	EST	006	005	And the king's young men said unto him, Behold, Haman is standing in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.
017	EST	006	006	So Haman came in; and the king said unto him, What shall be done with the man whom the king desireth to honor? And Haman said in his heart, To whom would the king desire to do honor more than to myself?
017	EST	006	007	Haman therefore said to the king, [For] the man whom the king desireth to honor,
017	EST	006	008	Let them bring a royal apparel which the king hath worn, and a horse on which the king hath ridden, and let there be placed a royal crown on his head.
017	EST	006	009	And let the apparel and the horse be given into the hand of one of the king's princes, of the most noble, that they may array the man whom the king desireth to honor, and let them cause him to ride on the horse through the streets of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall be done to the man whom the king desireth to honor.
017	EST	006	010	Then said the king to Haman, Make haste, take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast spoken, and do thus to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king's gate: leave out nothing of all that thou hast spoken.
017	EST	006	011	And Haman then took the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and caused him to ride through the streets of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall be done unto the man whom the king desireth to honor.
017	EST	006	012	And Mordecai thereupon returned to the king's gate; but Haman hastened to his house, mourning, and having his head covered.
017	EST	006	013	And Haman related to Zeresh his wife and to all his friends all that had befallen him: then said unto him his wise men and Zeresh his wife, If Mordecai, before whom thou hast begun to fall, be of the seed of the Jews, thou wilt not prevail against him, but thou wilt surely fall before him.
017	EST	006	014	They were yet speaking with him, when the king's chamberlains arrived, and they hastened to bring Haman unto the banquet which Esther had prepared.
017	EST	007	001	And the king came with Haman to drink with Esther the queen.
017	EST	007	002	And the king said unto Esther also on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even if it be equal to half the kingdom, it shall still be done.
017	EST	007	003	Then answered Esther the queen and said, If I have found grace in thy eyes, O king! and if it be pleasing unto the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request;
017	EST	007	004	For we have been sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain and to be exterminated; and if we had been only sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I would have remained silent; for the adversary regardeth not the damage of the king.
017	EST	007	005	Then spoke king Achashverosh and said unto Esther the queen, Who is this, and where is he, whose heart hath emboldened him to do so?
017	EST	007	006	And Esther said, An adversary, and inimical man, this wicked Haman. Then became Haman terrified before the king and the queen.
017	EST	007	007	And the king arose in his fury from the banquet of wine, and went into the palace-garden: and Haman remained behind to make request for his life of Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil fully determined.
017	EST	007	008	And when the king returned out of the palace-garden into the apartment of the banquet of wine, Haman was fallen upon the couch whereon Esther was: then said the king. Will he even do violence to the queen before me in the house? The word had just come out of the king's mouth, when they covered Haman's face.
017	EST	007	009	Then said Charbonah, one of the chamberlains, before the king, Behold, there is also the gallows, which Haman hath had made for Mordecai, who hath spoken well for the king, standing in the house of Haman, fifty cubits high. And the king said, Hang him thereon.
017	EST	007	010	So they hanged Haman on the gallows which he had prepared for Mordecai, and the fury of the king was appeased.
017	EST	008	001	On that day did king Achashverosh give the house of Haman the adversary of the Jews unto Esther the queen: and Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was unto her.
017	EST	008	002	And the king took off his signet-ring which he had taken away from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai: and Esther appointed Mordecai over the house of Haman.
017	EST	008	003	And Esther spoke again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and wept, and besought him to do away the evil of Haman the Agagite, and his device which he had devised against the Jews.
017	EST	008	004	And the king held out toward Esther the golden sceptre; and Esther arose, and stood up before the king;
017	EST	008	005	And she said, If it be pleasing to the king, and if I have found grace before him, and the thing seem proper before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to recall the letters, the device of Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he hath written to exterminate the Jews who are in all the provinces of the king.
017	EST	008	006	For how could I endure to look on the evil that is to befall my people? and how could I endure to look on the extermination of my kindred?
017	EST	008	007	Then said king Achashverosh unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, the house of Haman have I given to Esther, and him have they hanged on the gallows, because he had stretched out his hand against the Jews.
017	EST	008	008	But ye write yourselves concerning the Jews, as it may be good in your eyes, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's signet-ring; for a writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's signet-ring, cannot be recalled.
017	EST	008	009	Then were called the king's scribes at that time in the third month, that is, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth day thereof; and it was written all just as Mordecai commanded to the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the governors and the princes of the provinces who were from India unto Ethiopia, one hundred and twenty-seven provinces, unto every province according to its writing, and unto every people according to its language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language.
017	EST	008	010	And he wrote in the name of king Achashverosh, and sealed it with the king's signet-ring, and he sent letters through means of the swift messengers on horseback, and riders on mules, camels, and young dromedaries:
017	EST	008	011	That the king had granted to the Jews who were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand forward for their life, to destroy, to slay, and to exterminate all the military strength of the people and province that would assault them, both little ones and women, and to plunder their property as spoil,
017	EST	008	012	On one day in all the provinces of king Achashverosh, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.
017	EST	008	013	A copy of the writing to be given out as a law in every province, was published unto all nations, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.
017	EST	008	014	The swift messengers that rode upon mules and camels went out, being hastened and hurried forward with the command of the king: and the law was given out at Shushan the capital.
017	EST	008	015	And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in a royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a cloak of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan was glad and joyful.
017	EST	008	016	For the Jews there was light, with joy and gladness, and honor.
017	EST	008	017	And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king's command reached with his law, there were joy and gladness for the Jews, entertainments and a feast-day: and many of the people of the land became Jews; for the dread of the Jews had fallen upon them.
017	EST	009	001	And in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the thirteenth day thereof, when the king's command with his law drew near to he put into execution, on the day that the enemies of the Jews had hoped to have power over them, which had been changed nevertheless, so that the Jews had power over those that hated them,
017	EST	009	002	The Jews assembled together in their cities, throughout all the provinces of king Achashverosh, to stretch out their hand against those that had sought their injury: and no man could keep standing before them; for the dread of them had fallen upon all the nations.
017	EST	009	003	And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the governors, and the superintendents of the affairs of the king, elevated the Jews; because the dread of Mordecai had fallen upon them.
017	EST	009	004	For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went throughout all the provinces; for the man Mordecai became greater and greater.
017	EST	009	005	And the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and extermination; and they acted with those that hated them according to their pleasure.
017	EST	009	006	And in Shushan the capital the Jews slew and exterminated five hundred men.
017	EST	009	007	And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,
017	EST	009	008	And Poratha, and Adalya, and Aridatha,
017	EST	009	009	And Parmashtha, and Arissai, and Aridai, and Vayzatha,
017	EST	009	010	The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the adversary of the Jews, did they slay; but to the spoil did they not stretch forth their hand.
017	EST	009	011	On that same day came the number of those that were slain in Shushan the capital before the king.
017	EST	009	012	Then said the king unto Esther the queen, In Shushan the capital have the Jews slain and exterminated five hundred men, and the ten sons of Haman: what have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? Now what is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request farther? and it shall be done.
017	EST	009	013	Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it tomorrow also be granted to the Jews who are in Shushan to do according to the law of this day, and let the ten sons of Haman be hanged on the gallows.
017	EST	009	014	And the king ordered that it should be done so; and the law was given out at Shushan; and the ten sons of Haman were hanged.
017	EST	009	015	And the Jews that were in Shushan assembled together also on the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and slew at Shushan three hundred men; but to the spoil they did not stretch forth their hand.
017	EST	009	016	And the remaining Jews that were in the king's provinces assembled together, and stood forward for their life, and procured rest from their enemies, and slew of those that hated them seventy and five thousand; but to the spoil did they not stretch forth their hand,
017	EST	009	017	On the thirteenth day of the month Adar, and they rested on the fourteenth day thereof, and made it a day of entertainment and joy.
017	EST	009	018	But the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof, and rested on the fifteenth thereof, and made it a day of entertainment and joy.
017	EST	009	019	Therefore do the Jews of the villages, that dwell in the unwalled towns, make the fourteenth day of the month Adar as one of joy and entertainment, and a feast-day, and of sending portions one to another.
017	EST	009	020	And Mordecai wrote down these events; and he sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of king Achashverosh, those nigh and those far away,
017	EST	009	021	To take it on themselves as a duty, that they should celebrate the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same in each and every year,
017	EST	009	022	Like those days whereon the Jews had rest from their enemies, and the month which was changed unto them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a feast-day: to make them days of entertainment and joy, and of sending portions one to the other, and gifts to the needy.
017	EST	009	023	And the Jews took upon themselves that which they had begun already to do, and that which Mordecai had written unto them.
017	EST	009	024	Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the adversary of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to exterminate them, and had cast the Pur, that is, the lot, to destroy them, and to exterminate them.
017	EST	009	025	But when [Esther] came before the king, he ordered by that letter that his wicked device, which he had devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head: and they hanged him and his sons on the gallows.
017	EST	009	026	Therefore did they call these days Purim, after the name of Pur: therefore, because of all the words of this letter, both for that which they had experienced thereby, and for that which had occurred unto them,
017	EST	009	027	The Jews confirmed it as a duty, and took upon themselves, and upon their seed, and upon all such as join themselves unto them, so that no one should fail therein, that they would celebrate these two days according to their prescription, and at their appointed time, in each and every year.
017	EST	009	028	And these days are remembered and celebrated throughout each and every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and these days of Purim will not pass away from the midst of the Jews, nor will their memorial cease from their seed.
017	EST	009	029	Then wrote Esther the queen, the daughter of Abichayil, with Mordecai the Jew, with all due strength, to confirm this letter of Purim the second time.
017	EST	009	030	And he sent letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Achashverosh, word's of peace and truth,
017	EST	009	031	To confirm these days of Purim in their times, just as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined on them, and as they had confirmed for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the fastings and their prayers.
017	EST	009	032	And the order of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.
017	EST	010	001	And king Achashverosh imposed a tribute upon the land, and the isles of the sea.
017	EST	010	002	And all the acts of his strength and of his might, and the exposition of the greatness of Mordecai, wherewith the king made him great, behold they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia.
017	EST	010	003	For Mordecai the Jew was the second in rank after king Achashverosh, and great among the Jews, and acceptable to the multitude of his brethren, a promoter of good to his people, and speaking peace to all its seed.

# BOOK	018	JOB	Job	Job
018	JOB	001	001	There was a man in the land of 'Uz, Job was his name; And this man was perfect and upright, and fearing God, and eschewing evil.
018	JOB	001	002	And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.
018	JOB	001	003	And his cattle consisted of seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and he had a very great store of servants: so that this man was greater than all the sons of the east.
018	JOB	001	004	And his sons used to go and prepare a feast in the house of every one on his day; and they sent and invited their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.
018	JOB	001	005	And it happened, when the days of the feast were gone round, that Job sent and sanctified them, and he then rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt-offerings according to the number of all of them; for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and have renounced God in their heart. In this manner used Job to do all the time.
018	JOB	001	006	Now it happened on a certain day, when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, that the Accuser also came in the midst of them.
018	JOB	001	007	Then said the Lord unto the Accuser, Whence comest thou? And the Accuser answered the Lord, and said, From roaming over the earth, and from wandering through it.
018	JOB	001	008	Then said the Lord unto the Accuser, Hast thou directed thy attention toward my servant Job; for there is none like him on the earth, a man perfect and upright, who feareth God, and escheweth evil?
018	JOB	001	009	Then answered the Accuser the Lord, and said, Is it for nought that Job feareth God?
018	JOB	001	010	Behold, thou hast indeed placed a fence about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath, on every side: the work of his hands hast thou blessed, and his cattle are far spread out in the land.
018	JOB	001	011	But stretch only forth thy hand and touch all that he hath, and [see] whether he will not renounce thee to thy face.
018	JOB	001	012	Then said the Lord unto the Accuser, Behold, all that is his be in thy power; only against himself shalt thou not stretch forth thy hand. The Accuser went thereupon away from the presence of the Lord.
018	JOB	001	013	And it happened on a certain day, when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their first-born brother,
018	JOB	001	014	That a messenger came unto Job, and said, The oxen were ploughing, and the she-asses were feeding beside them:
018	JOB	001	015	When the Sabeans made an incursion, and took them away, and the young men they slew with the edge of the sword; and I am escaped, none but myself alone, to tell it unto thee.
018	JOB	001	016	This one was yet speaking, when another came, and said, A fire of God fell from heaven, and burnt among the sheep and the young men, and consumed them; and I am escaped, none but myself alone, to tell it unto thee.
018	JOB	001	017	This one was yet speaking, when another came, and said, The Chaldeans posted themselves in three divisions, and made an inroad against the camels, and took them away, and the young men they slew with the edge of the sword; and I am escaped, none but myself alone, to tell it unto thee.
018	JOB	001	018	While this one was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their first-born brother:
018	JOB	001	019	When, behold, a violent wind came from the direction of the wilderness, and struck against the four corners of the house, so that it fell upon the young men, and they died; and I am escaped, none but myself alone, to tell it unto thee.
018	JOB	001	020	Then arose Job, and rent his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and prostrated himself.
018	JOB	001	021	And he said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; may the name of the Lord be blessed.
018	JOB	001	022	With all this did Job not sin, and attributed no injustice to God.
018	JOB	002	001	And it happened [again] on a certain day, when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, that the Accuser also came in the midst of them to present himself before the Lord.
018	JOB	002	002	Then said the Lord unto the Accuser, Whence comest thou now? And the Accuser answered the Lord, and said, From roaming over the earth, and from wandering through it.
018	JOB	002	003	Then said the Lord unto the Accuser, Hast thou directed thy attention toward my servant Job: for there is none like him on the earth, a man perfect and upright, who feareth God, and escheweth evil? and he is still holding fast to his integrity, and thou hast incited me against him, to destroy him without cause.
018	JOB	002	004	Then answered the Accuser the Lord, and said, Skin for skin: yea, all that a man hath will he give in behalf of his life.
018	JOB	002	005	But stretch only forth thy hand, and touch his bone and his flesh, and [see] whether he will not renounce thee to thy face.
018	JOB	002	006	Then said the Lord unto the Accuser, Behold, he is in thy hand: only take care of his life.
018	JOB	002	007	Thereupon went the Accuser forth from the presence of the Lord, and he smote Job with a sore inflammation, from the sole of his foot unto the crown of his head.
018	JOB	002	008	And [Job] took himself a potsherd to scrape himself there with, while he was sitting down among the ashes.
018	JOB	002	009	Then said his wife unto him, Art thou still holding fast to thy integrity? renounce God, and die.
018	JOB	002	010	But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the worthless women would speak. What? should we accept the good alone, from God, and the evil we should not accept? With all this did Job not sin with his lips.
018	JOB	002	011	When now the three friends of Job had heard of all this evil that was come over him, they came every one from his own place, Eliphaz the Themanite, and Bildad the Shuchite, and Zophar the Na'amthite; and they met together to come to condole with him and to comfort him.
018	JOB	002	012	And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and they recognised him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his robe, and strewed dust upon their heads toward heaven.
018	JOB	002	013	They likewise sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights; but no one spoke a word unto him; for they saw that his pain was very great.
018	JOB	003	001	After this time Job opened his mouth, and cursed his day.
018	JOB	003	002	And Job commenced, and said,
018	JOB	003	003	Oh that the day whereon I was born might perish, and the night when it was said, There hath been a male child conceived.
018	JOB	003	004	May that day be [covered with] darkness; may not God from above inquire for it, and may no light beam upon it.
018	JOB	003	005	Oh that darkness and the shadow of death might defile it; may a cloud rest upon it; may the blackness of the day terrify it.
018	JOB	003	006	Yon night — let darkness seize upon it; let it not be united to the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the [periods lighted by the] moon.
018	JOB	003	007	Lo, may that night be solitary, let no song of joy occur thereon.
018	JOB	003	008	Let those denounce it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning cry.
018	JOB	003	009	Let the stars of its twilight be darkened; let it hope for light, and there be none; and let it not behold the eyelids of the morning-dawn;
018	JOB	003	010	Because God closed not against me the doors of the womb, and thus concealed trouble from my eyes.
018	JOB	003	011	Why did I not die [the moment I issued] from the womb, and [why] was I not born merely to perish at once?
018	JOB	003	012	Wherefore were knees ready to receive me? and for what purpose were breasts there that I might suck?
018	JOB	003	013	For now should I be lying still and be quiet; I should sleep: then would I be at rest,
018	JOB	003	014	With kings and counsellors of the earth, who build up ruined places for themselves;
018	JOB	003	015	Or with princes possessing gold, who fill their houses with silver;
018	JOB	003	016	Or as an untimely birth, hidden [from view] I should not exist; as infants that never have seen the light;
018	JOB	003	017	There [where] the wicked cease from troubling; and where the exhausted weary are at rest;
018	JOB	003	018	[Where] the prisoners repose together, [and] they hear no more the taskmaster's voice.
018	JOB	003	019	The small with the great is there, and the servant free from his master.
018	JOB	003	020	Wherefore giveth He now light to the labor-laden, and life unto the bitter in soul?
018	JOB	003	021	Who wait for death, which [cometh] not; and who dig for it sooner than for hidden treasures;
018	JOB	003	022	Who would rejoice even to exulting, who would be glad could they but find a grave?
018	JOB	003	023	[Why is light given] to a man whose way is hidden, and around whom God hath placed a fence?
018	JOB	003	024	For before my food cometh my groaning, and like the water are poured forth my loud complaints.
018	JOB	003	025	Because what I greatly dreaded is come upon me, and what I apprehended is come unto me.
018	JOB	003	026	I have had no safety, and no quiet, and no rest; and [now] harrowing trouble is come.
018	JOB	004	001	Then answered Eliphaz the Themanite, and said,
018	JOB	004	002	If we essay to address a word to thee, wilt thou be wearied? yet who is able to refrain from speaking?
018	JOB	004	003	Behold, thou hast [ere this] corrected many, and weak hands thou wast wont to strengthen.
018	JOB	004	004	Him that stumbled thy words used to uphold, and to sinking knees thou gavest vigor.
018	JOB	004	005	Yet now, when it cometh to thee, thou art wearied: it toucheth even thee, and thou art terrified.
018	JOB	004	006	Is not then thy fear of God still thy confidence, thy hope equal to the integrity of thy ways?
018	JOB	004	007	Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous destroyed?
018	JOB	004	008	Even as I have seen, that those who plough wrong-doing, and sow trouble, have to reap the same.
018	JOB	004	009	Before the breathing of God they perish, and before the breath of his nostrils they come to their end.
018	JOB	004	010	The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.
018	JOB	004	011	The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the whelps of the lioness have to scatter themselves abroad.
018	JOB	004	012	But to me a word came by stealth, and my ear took in a scarcely perceptible whisper thereof.
018	JOB	004	013	In intense thoughts out of visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men:
018	JOB	004	014	Dread came over me, with trembling, and it caused all my bones to shudder.
018	JOB	004	015	Then flitted a spirit past before my face; the hair of my body stood up:
018	JOB	004	016	It stood still, but I could not recognize its form; a figure was before my eyes, a slight whisper, then a [louder] voice I heard, saying,
018	JOB	004	017	Can a mortal be more righteous than God? or can a man be more pure than his Maker?
018	JOB	004	018	Behold, in his servants he putteth no trust, and his angels he chargeth with folly:
018	JOB	004	019	How much less in those that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed till they come to be eaten by the moth?
018	JOB	004	020	From morning to evening are they broken to pieces: without laying it [to heart] they perish for ever.
018	JOB	004	021	Behold, their excellency which is in them is torn away: they die, and this without wisdom.
018	JOB	005	001	Do but call: is there one that will answer thee? and to whom of the saints wilt thou turn thyself?
018	JOB	005	002	For vexation will prove death to a foolish man, and jealousy will slay the simple.
018	JOB	005	003	I have myself seen the foolish taking root; but I suddenly held his habitation as accursed.
018	JOB	005	004	His children are far from help, and men crush them in the gate, with no one to deliver them.
018	JOB	005	005	[He it is] whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber snatcheth eagerly after their substance.
018	JOB	005	006	For wrong doth not come forth out of the dust, neither doth trouble grow up out of the ground;
018	JOB	005	007	But man is born unto trouble, as young birds take up their flight.
018	JOB	005	008	I, however, would have besought God, and unto God would I have committed my cause;
018	JOB	005	009	Who doth great things which are unsearchable, marvelous things till they are without number;
018	JOB	005	010	Who giveth rain upon the surface of the earth, and sendeth out waters over the face of the fields;
018	JOB	005	011	To set up the lowly on high, that those who mourn may rise high to happiness;
018	JOB	005	012	[But] who frustrateth the plans of the crafty, so that their hands cannot execute their well-devised counsel;
018	JOB	005	013	Who catcheth the wise in their own craftiness; and the advise of the perverse is hastened on headlong;
018	JOB	005	014	By day they meet with darkness, and as though it were night they grope about in the noon of day;
018	JOB	005	015	But who saveth from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty, the needy one:
018	JOB	005	016	And so cometh to the indigent hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.
018	JOB	005	017	Behold, happy is the man whom God admonisheth: despise then not the correction of the Almighty.
018	JOB	005	018	For he it is that woundeth, and bindeth up: he smiteth, and his hands do heal.
018	JOB	005	019	In six distresses will he deliver thee; and in seven there shall no evil touch thee.
018	JOB	005	020	In famine he redeemeth thee from death; and in war from the power of the sword.
018	JOB	005	021	Against the scourge of the tongue shall thou he hidden; and thou needest not be afraid of destruction when it cometh.
018	JOB	005	022	At destruction and famine canst thou laugh; and thou needest not have any fear of the beasts of the earth.
018	JOB	005	023	For with the stones of the field shalt thou have thy covenant; and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.
018	JOB	005	024	And thou shalt know that there is peace in thy tent; and thou wilt look over thy habitation, and shalt miss nothing.
018	JOB	005	025	And thou shalt know that thy seed is numerous, and thy offspring as the herbage of the earth.
018	JOB	005	026	Thon wilt go in a ripe age unto the grave, as a shock of corn is carried home in its season.
018	JOB	005	027	Behold this, we have searched it out, so it is: hear it, and do thou note it well for thyself.
018	JOB	006	001	Then answered Job, and said,
018	JOB	006	002	Oh that my vexation could be truly weighed, and my calamity; oh that men might lift it up in the balances at once!
018	JOB	006	003	For now it is already heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore are my words confused.
018	JOB	006	004	For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof my spirit drinketh it: the terrors of God set themselves in array against me.
018	JOB	006	005	Doth the wild ass bray over the grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?
018	JOB	006	006	Is ever tasteless food eaten without salt? or is there any flavor in the white of an egg?
018	JOB	006	007	My soul refuseth to touch them: they are unto me like disgusting food.
018	JOB	006	008	Oh that some one would grant the accomplishment of my request; and that God would grant me the fulfillment of my hope!
018	JOB	006	009	Yea, that it would please God that he might crush me: that he would let loose his hand, and make an end of me!
018	JOB	006	010	Then would this be still my comfort; yea, I would rejoice in my pain while be would not spare: that I have not gainsaid the commands of the Holy One.—
018	JOB	006	011	What is my strength, that I should wait? and what my end, that I should yet longer retain my patience?
018	JOB	006	012	Is the strength of stones my strength? or is my flesh brazen?
018	JOB	006	013	Truly, am I not without my help in me? and is not wise counsel driven far away from me?
018	JOB	006	014	As though I were one who refuseth kindness to his friend, and forsaketh the fear of the Almighty:
018	JOB	006	015	My brothers are treacherous as a brook, like flowing brooks they pass along;
018	JOB	006	016	Which are made turbid by reason of the ice, wherein the snow hideth itself;
018	JOB	006	017	At the time when they feel the warmth, they vanish; when it is hot, they are quenched out of their place.
018	JOB	006	018	The paths of their course wind themselves along; they go in the wilderness and are lost.
018	JOB	006	019	The caravans of Thema look hither, the travelling companies Sheba hope for them;
018	JOB	006	020	But they stand ashamed because they had trusted; they come thither and are made to blush.
018	JOB	006	021	For truly now ye are like such a one: ye see my terrible state and are afraid.
018	JOB	006	022	Have I then ever said, Give me something, and out of your property offer a bribe in my behalf?
018	JOB	006	023	And deliver me from the hand of the adversary? and redeem from the hand of tyrants?
018	JOB	006	024	Teach me, and I will indeed remain silent; and wherein I erred give me to understand.
018	JOB	006	025	How pleasant are straightforward words! but what doth arguing prove?
018	JOB	006	026	Do ye think to reprove words, and [to regard] as wind the speeches of one that is despairing?
018	JOB	006	027	Yea, ye would cast any thing upon the fatherless, and ye would dig a pit against your friend.
018	JOB	006	028	But now, if it please you, turn yourselves toward me, and [say] whether I would lie before your face.
018	JOB	006	029	Reflect again, I pray you, there will be no wrong: yea, reflect once more, my righteousness [will be found] therein.
018	JOB	006	030	Is there any wrong on my tongue? or should my palate not understand [if I spoke] what is iniquitous?
018	JOB	007	001	Is there not a limited time of service to a mortal upon the earth? Are not his days also like the days of a hired laborer?
018	JOB	007	002	As a servant eagerly longeth for the shadow, and as a hired laborer hopeth for his reward:
018	JOB	007	003	So was I compelled to possess months of vanity, and nights of trouble were counted out unto me.
018	JOB	007	004	When I He down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am wearied with tossings about till the dawn of day.
018	JOB	007	005	My flesh is covered with worms and clods of dust: my skin is burst open, and become loathsome.
018	JOB	007	006	My days hasten away more swiftly than a weaver's shuttle, and they come to an end in the absence of hope.
018	JOB	007	007	Oh remember that nothing but a breath is my life; that my eye will not again see happiness;
018	JOB	007	008	The eye of him that seeth me now will not behold me again: [thou fixest] thy eyes upon me, and I am no more.
018	JOB	007	009	As the cloud vanisheth and passeth away: so will he that goeth down to the nether world not come up again.
018	JOB	007	010	He will return no more to his house, and his place will not recognize him any more.
018	JOB	007	011	Therefore will I also not restrain my mouth: I will speak in the anguish of my spirit: I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
018	JOB	007	012	Am I a sea, or a monster, that thou settest a watch over me?
018	JOB	007	013	For should I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall help me bear my complaint:
018	JOB	007	014	Then wouldst thou frighten me with dreams, and with visions wouldst thou terrify me;
018	JOB	007	015	So that my soul would choose strangling, death rather than these limbs of mine.
018	JOB	007	016	I loathe it; I cannot live for ever: let me alone; for my days are but nought.
018	JOB	007	017	What is the mortal, that thou shouldst make him great? and that thou shouldst direct thy heart toward him?
018	JOB	007	018	And that thou shouldst visit him every morning, probe him every moment?
018	JOB	007	019	How long wilt thou not turn thy regard from me, nor let; me loose till I swallow down my spittle?
018	JOB	007	020	If I have sinned, what [injury] can I cause unto thee, O thou Guardian of men? why hast thou set me as an object for thee to strike at, so that I am become a burden to myself?
018	JOB	007	021	And why wilt thou not forgive my transgression, and let my iniquity pass away? for soon must I lie down in the dust; and thou wilt seek for me, but I shall be no more.
018	JOB	008	001	Then answered Bildad the Shuchite, and said,
018	JOB	008	002	How long wilt thou speak these things? and [let] like a mighty wind be the words of thy mouth?
018	JOB	008	003	Should God pervert justice? or should the Almighty pervert righteousness?
018	JOB	008	004	If thy children have sinned against him, then did he send them off through the means of their transgression.
018	JOB	008	005	If thou wilt earnestly seek for God, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;
018	JOB	008	006	If thou become pure and upright: surely then will he watch over thee, and restore thy righteous habitation.
018	JOB	008	007	And thy beginning will have been small; because thy latter end will grow up greatly.
018	JOB	008	008	For ask, I pray thee, of an earlier generation, and prepare thyself to [stand by] the research of their fathers; —
018	JOB	008	009	For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because a [mere] shadow are our days upon earth; —
018	JOB	008	010	Behold, these will truly teach thee, they will speak unto thee, and out of their very heart will they bring forth words:
018	JOB	008	011	Can the bulrush shoot upward without mire? can the meadow-grass grow up without water?
018	JOB	008	012	It is yet in its greenness, not yet cut down, when it withereth before any other grass.
018	JOB	008	013	So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hope of the hypocrite will perish:
018	JOB	008	014	[It is he] whose trust will be cut off, and but a spider's web is that in which he confideth.
018	JOB	008	015	He leaneth against his house, but it shall not stand: he layeth fast hold on it, but it shall not remain erect.
018	JOB	008	016	He is in full vigor before the sun, and over his garden his shoots go forth.
018	JOB	008	017	His roots are twisted about a stoneheap, he selecteth [for himself] a place of stones.
018	JOB	008	018	But when men destroy him from his place, then will it deny him, saying, I have never seen thee.
018	JOB	008	019	Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the [same] dust others will grow up.
018	JOB	008	020	Behold, God will not reject a perfect man, and will not hold fast by their hand the evil-doers:
018	JOB	008	021	Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with joyful shouting.
018	JOB	008	022	They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the tent of the wicked shall be no more.
018	JOB	009	001	Then answered Job, and said,
018	JOB	009	002	Truly I know that it is so: and how could a mortal be righteous before God?
018	JOB	009	003	If he were desirous to enter into a contest with him, he could not give him one answer out of a thousand.
018	JOB	009	004	He is wise of heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and escaped unscathed?
018	JOB	009	005	[He it is] who removeth mountains, and they know it not, yea, when he overturneth them in his anger;
018	JOB	009	006	Who shaketh the earth loose out of her place, that her pillars tremble;
018	JOB	009	007	Who speaketh to the sun, and he shineth not, and around the stars he placeth a seal;
018	JOB	009	008	Who spread out the heavens by himself alone, and treadeth upon the hillocks of the sea;
018	JOB	009	009	Who made the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, and the chambers the south;
018	JOB	009	010	Who doth great things which are quite unsearchable, and wonders which are quite without number.
018	JOB	009	011	Lo, were he to go past by me, I should not see him; and were he to pass along, I should not perceive him.
018	JOB	009	012	Behold, were he to snatch aught away, who could hold him back? who would say unto him, What dost thou?
018	JOB	009	013	God will not withdraw his anger: beneath him sink down the helpers of the proud.
018	JOB	009	014	How much less then could I answer him, and select my words [to contend] with him?
018	JOB	009	015	Whom, were I even righteous, I could not answer? to him that condemneth me I could [only] make supplication.
018	JOB	009	016	Or were I to call, and he would answer me, I could yet not believe that he would give ear unto my voice—
018	JOB	009	017	He that bruiseth me with [his] tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without a cause.
018	JOB	009	018	He suffereth me not to recover my breath; but feedeth me overmuch with bitter things.
018	JOB	009	019	If it regard strength, lo, he is the powerful; and if justice, who will cite him for me to appear?
018	JOB	009	020	If I were righteous even, my own mouth would condemn me: were I innocent, it would still prove me perverse.
018	JOB	009	021	I am innocent; I will not have regard for myself: I will despise my life.
018	JOB	009	022	One thing is [certain], therefore have I said it, The innocent and the wicked he bringeth to their end.
018	JOB	009	023	If a scourge should slay suddenly, he will mock at the trial of the guiltless.
018	JOB	009	024	Is a land given up into the hand of the wicked? he covereth the faces of its judges: if this be not the truth, who is it then?
018	JOB	009	025	And my days pass swifter than a runner: they flee away, they see no happiness,
018	JOB	009	026	They hasten along like pirate ships: like the eagle that stoopeth down upon his food.
018	JOB	009	027	If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my sorrowful countenance, and recover my cheerfulness:
018	JOB	009	028	O then would I be in dread of all my pains; I know that thou wilt not declare me innocent.
018	JOB	009	029	I must ever be guilty: why then should I fatigue myself for nought?
018	JOB	009	030	If I were to wash myself in snow-water, to cleanse myself in the purity of my hands:
018	JOB	009	031	Even then wouldst thou plunge me in the ditch, that my own clothes would render me abhorred.
018	JOB	009	032	For he is not a man, like me, that I could answer him, that we should enter together into a contest.
018	JOB	009	033	There is no one who can decide between us, who could lay his hand upon us both.
018	JOB	009	034	Let him but remove from me his rod, and let not his dread terrify me:
018	JOB	009	035	Then would I speak, and not fear him; for the like I feel not within me.
018	JOB	010	001	My soul is disgusted with my life; I will give free vent to my complaint over myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
018	JOB	010	002	I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; let me know for what cause thou contendest against me.
018	JOB	010	003	Is it well for thee that thou shouldst oppress, that thou shouldst reject the labor of thy hands, and shed light upon the counsel of the wicked?
018	JOB	010	004	Hast thou eyes of flesh? or wilt thou see as a mortal seeth?
018	JOB	010	005	Are thy days as the days of a mortal, or are thy years as the days of a man,
018	JOB	010	006	That thou inquirest after my iniquity, and searchest after my sin?
018	JOB	010	007	Still it is within thy knowledge that I am not wicked, and there is none that can deliver me out of thy hand.
018	JOB	010	008	Thy hands have carefully fashioned me and made me; every thing is in harmony all round about; and yet thou dost destroy me!
018	JOB	010	009	Remember, I beseech thee, that as though I were clay hast thou made me; and wilt thou cause me to return again unto the dust?
018	JOB	010	010	Behold, like milk didst thou pour me out, and like cheese didst thou curdle me.
018	JOB	010	011	With skin and flesh didst thou clothe me, and with bones and sinews didst thou cover me.
018	JOB	010	012	Life and kindness didst thou grant me, and thy providence watched over my spirit.
018	JOB	010	013	And yet these things hadst thou treasured up in thy heart: I know that this was [resolved] within thee.
018	JOB	010	014	If I have sinned, then dost thou watch me, and from my iniquity thou wilt not declare me guiltless.
018	JOB	010	015	If I be wicked, woe unto me: and if I be righteous, I can still not lift up my head; I am sated with disgrace, and ever seeing my affliction;
018	JOB	010	016	And it constantly increaseth; like a fierce lion dost thou hunt for me; and again thou showest thyself continually wonderful on me;
018	JOB	010	017	Thou ever renewest thy witnesses against me, and causest thy indignation to grow strong against me; changes and multitudes [of sufferings] are around me.
018	JOB	010	018	Wherefore then didst thou bring me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had perished, and that no eye had seen me!
018	JOB	010	019	That I were as though I had not been, —had been borne from the womb to the grave.
018	JOB	010	020	Lo! my days are but few: cease, then, withdraw from me [thy hand], that I may recover my cheerfulness a little.
018	JOB	010	021	Before I go, and return not, to the land of darkness and the shadow of death,
018	JOB	010	022	A land of utter gloom, as of the darkness of the shadow of death, without any order, and the light of which is like utter gloom.
018	JOB	011	001	Then answered Zophar the Na'amathite, and said.
018	JOB	011	002	Shall a multitude of words not be answered? and is it so that a man full of talk shall be deemed in the right?
018	JOB	011	003	Thy inventions are to bring men to silence; and when thou utterest thy mocking no one is to cause thee to feel abashed!
018	JOB	011	004	For thou hast said [to God], My doctrine is pure, and I am become clean in thy eyes.
018	JOB	011	005	But oh that God would but speak, and open his lips against thee;
018	JOB	011	006	And that he would declare unto thee the secrets of wisdom; for it is double to that which is really in our possession: and thou wouldst experience that God overlooketh unto thee much of thy iniquity.
018	JOB	011	007	Canst thou find out the experience of God? or canst thou find [the way] unto the utmost limit of the Almighty?
018	JOB	011	008	It is as high as heaven; what canst thou effect? it is deeper than the nether world; what canst thou know?
018	JOB	011	009	Longer than the earth is its measure, and broader than the sea.
018	JOB	011	010	If he pass by, and surrender [one to suffering], and call together an assembly, who can hinder him?
018	JOB	011	011	For he knoweth the men of vanity: he seeth the wrong-doer and him who considereth not;
018	JOB	011	012	And the heartless who acquireth intelligence, and him who is [like] the colt of the wild ass who is transformed into a man.
018	JOB	011	013	If thou truly direct [aright] thy heart, and spread out thy hands toward him: —
018	JOB	011	014	If wrong be in thy hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tents.
018	JOB	011	015	For then canst thou lift up thy face free from blemish: yea, thou wilt stand steadfast, and needest not to fear;
018	JOB	011	016	Because thou wilt truly forget thy trouble, and as a waterflood that is passed away wilt thou remember it;
018	JOB	011	017	And brighter than the noon of day will thy earthly existence arise; and thy obscurity will be like thy morning.
018	JOB	011	018	And thou wilt feel trust, because there is hope: yea, thou wilt search about carefully, and thou wilt lie down in safety.
018	JOB	011	019	Also thou wilt stretch thyself out [to rest], with none to make thee afraid; and many will entreat thy favor.
018	JOB	011	020	But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and the means of escape will vanish from them, and their [sole] hope shall be the breathing out of their soul.
018	JOB	012	001	Then answered Job, and said,
018	JOB	012	002	Truly ye are indeed the [right kind of] people, and with you wisdom must die out.
018	JOB	012	003	I also have sense like you; I do not fall short compared with you: and who possesseth not such things as these?
018	JOB	012	004	I am as one laughed at by his friend, who calleth upon God, while he answered him: [yea,] a laughing-stock though righteous and innocent.
018	JOB	012	005	To the unfortunate there is given contempt— according to the thoughts of him that is at ease— prepared [also] for those whose foot slippeth.
018	JOB	012	006	Prosperous are the tents of robbers, and security is given to those that provoke God. to him who carrieth his god in his hand.
018	JOB	012	007	Yet, do only ask of the beasts, and they will instruct thee; and the fowls of the heavens, and they will tell it thee;
018	JOB	012	008	Or speak to the earth, and she will instruct thee; and the fishes of the sea will inform thee
018	JOB	012	009	Who knoweth not through all these that the hand of the Lord hath wrought this?
018	JOB	012	010	[He] in whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the spirit of all the bodies of men?
018	JOB	012	011	Doth not the ear try words, as the palate tasteth food for itself?
018	JOB	012	012	So It with the ancients wisdom, and with [those of] length of days understanding,
018	JOB	012	013	That with him are wisdom and strength, his are counsel and understanding.
018	JOB	012	014	Behold, he pulleth down, and there can be no rebuilding: he locketh [the prison] upon a man, and there can be no opening,
018	JOB	012	015	Behold, he restraineth the waters, and they dry up; or he suffereth them to flow, and they overturn the earth.
018	JOB	012	016	With him are strength and counsel: his are the deceived and the deceiver.
018	JOB	012	017	He leadeth counsellors away bereft of sense, and maketh the judges fools.
018	JOB	012	018	He looseth the bond of kings, and bindeth a girdle around their loins.
018	JOB	012	019	He leadeth priests away bereft of sense, and the powerful he causeth to walk on crooked paths.
018	JOB	012	020	He removeth the speech from trusty speakers, and taketh away the intelligence of the aged.
018	JOB	012	021	He poureth contempt upon princes, and the belt of the mighty be looseneth.
018	JOB	012	022	He layeth open deep things from the midst of darkness, and bringeth out unto light the shadow of death.
018	JOB	012	023	He permitteth the nations to become great, and destroyeth them: he spreadeth out the nations, and leadeth them away.
018	JOB	012	024	He taketh away the sense of the chiefs of the people of the land, and causeth them to wander astray in a wilderness when there is no way.
018	JOB	012	025	They grope in the dark without light, and he causeth them to wander astray like a drunken man.
018	JOB	013	001	Lo, all [this] hath my eye seen, my ear hath heard and noted it for itself;
018	JOB	013	002	As much as ye know, do I also know: I do not fall short compared with you.
018	JOB	013	003	However, I would gladly speak to the Almighty; and to argue with God do I desire.
018	JOB	013	004	But ye are inventors of falsehood, physicians of no value are all of you.
018	JOB	013	005	Oh, who would grant that ye might keep a profound silences! and it would he accounted unto you as wisdom.
018	JOB	013	006	Do hearken but to my reasoning, and listen to the pleadings of my lips.
018	JOB	013	007	Will ye speak wrong things for God? and will ye speak for him deceitfully?
018	JOB	013	008	Will ye show him undue favor, when ye contend for God?
018	JOB	013	009	Will it be well if he should search you out? or as one overreacheth another mortal, do ye expect to overreach him?
018	JOB	013	010	He will surely reprove you, if in secret you show him undue favor.
018	JOB	013	011	Doth not his excellency terrify you? and his dread fall upon you?
018	JOB	013	012	The things you remember are mere proverbs of ashes, your high-places are high-places of clay.
018	JOB	013	013	Keep silence toward me, that I may indeed speak, and let pass over me what will.
018	JOB	013	014	Whatever it may cost, I will take my flesh in my teeth, and my life will I put in my hand.
018	JOB	013	015	Lo, though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: only I will argue my own ways before him.
018	JOB	013	016	Even he will come to my assistance; for a hypocrite cannot come before him.
018	JOB	013	017	Listen well to my word, and to my demonstration with your ears.
018	JOB	013	018	Behold now, I have arrayed my cause: I know that I shall be indeed justified.
018	JOB	013	019	Who is he that will contend with me? for now, if I keep silence, I must perish.
018	JOB	013	020	Only two things do not unto me: then will I not hide myself from thy presence.
018	JOB	013	021	Remove thy hand far from me; and let not thy dread terrify me.
018	JOB	013	022	Then call thou, and I will answer; or let me speak, and do thou reply to me.
018	JOB	013	023	How many are my iniquities and sins? my transgression and my sin let me know.
018	JOB	013	024	Wherefore wilt thou hide thy face, and regard me as an enemy unto thee?
018	JOB	013	025	Wilt thou terrify a leaf driven about [by the wind]? and wilt thou pursue dry stubble?
018	JOB	013	026	That thou writest bitter decrees against me, and assignest unto me the iniquities of my youth;
018	JOB	013	027	And [that] thou puttest my feet in the stocks, and watchest narrowly all my paths; [and] settest for thyself a mark upon the soles of my feet?
018	JOB	013	028	And yet the body decayeth like a rotten thing, as a garment that the moth hath eaten.
018	JOB	014	001	Man born of a woman is short of days, and sated with harrowing trouble.
018	JOB	014	002	Like a flower he cometh forth, and is cut down: and he fleeth like a shadow, and remaineth not.
018	JOB	014	003	And yet on such a one dost thou open thy eyes, and me thou bringest into judgment with thee?
018	JOB	014	004	Who can make a clean thing out of an unclean? not one [thing].
018	JOB	014	005	Seeing that his days are determined, the number of his months are [fixed] with thee, that thou hast set his bounds which he cannot pass:
018	JOB	014	006	Turn thyself from him that he may recover from his pain, and be able to enjoy like a hired laborer his day.
018	JOB	014	007	For there is hope for the tree: if it be cut down, it may still sprout again, while its young shoot will not cease.
018	JOB	014	008	If even its root become old in the earth, and its stock die in the dust:
018	JOB	014	009	Yet through the scent of water will it flourish [again], and produce boughs as though It were newly planted.
018	JOB	014	010	But man dieth, and lieth powerless: yea, the son of earth departeth—and where is he?
018	JOB	014	011	The waters run off from the sea, and the river faileth and drieth up:
018	JOB	014	012	So doth man lie down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they will not awake, and will not be roused out of their sleep.
018	JOB	014	013	Oh who would grant that thou mightest hide me in the nether world, that thou mightest conceal me, until thy wrath be appeased, that thou mightest set for me a fixed time, and remember me then!
018	JOB	014	014	Or, when a man dieth, will he live again? all the days of my time of service would I then wait, till [the hour of] my release were come.
018	JOB	014	015	Do thou call, and I will truly answer thee: have a desire for the work of thy hands.
018	JOB	014	016	Yet now thou numberest my steps: and thou waitest not with [the punishment of] my sin.
018	JOB	014	017	Sealed up in a bag is my transgression, and thou yet addest to my iniquity.
018	JOB	014	018	But truly a falling mountain will crumble, and [even] a rock is moved out of its place.
018	JOB	014	019	The water weareth out stones; thou sweepest away their fragments [like] the dust of the earth: and so thou destroyest the hope of man.
018	JOB	014	020	Thou assailest him with might without ceasing, till he passeth away: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him off.
018	JOB	014	021	His children acquire honor, but he knoweth it not: and they are esteemed little, but he perceiveth nothing of them.
018	JOB	014	022	But his body. on him, feeleth pain, and his soul will mourn for him.
018	JOB	015	001	Then answered Eliphaz the Themanite, and said,
018	JOB	015	002	Should a wise man utter windy knowledge, and fill his inward parts with the east wind?
018	JOB	015	003	Should he reason with a speech which availeth nothing? and with words in which there is no profit?
018	JOB	015	004	Yea, thou truly makest void the fear [of God], and diminishest devotion before God.
018	JOB	015	005	For thy iniquity teacheth thy mouth, so that thou choosest the language of the crafty.
018	JOB	015	006	Thy own mouth must condemn thee, but not I: yea, thy own lips will testify against thee.
018	JOB	015	007	Wast thou born as the first man? or wast thou brought forth before the hills?
018	JOB	015	008	Hast thou listened to the secret counsel of God? and is wisdom therefore of little esteem with thee?
018	JOB	015	009	What knowest thou, that we do not know? what understandest thou, which is not with us?
018	JOB	015	010	Both the grayheaded and the very aged are among us, — richer than thy father in days.
018	JOB	015	011	Are the divine consolations too little for thee? and the word that was so mild with thee?
018	JOB	015	012	Whither doth thy heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes gaze at?
018	JOB	015	013	That thou shouldst turn against God thy spirit, and utter [such] words out of thy mouth?
018	JOB	015	014	What is man, that he should be pure? and that he who is born of woman should be declared righteous?
018	JOB	015	015	Behold, in his holy ones he putteth no trust; and the heavens are not pure in his eyes:
018	JOB	015	016	How much more then the abominable and corrupt, the man who drinketh like water wrong-doing?
018	JOB	015	017	I will instruct thee, hear me; and what I have seen will I relate;
018	JOB	015	018	Which wise men have ever told, and have not concealed, as they obtained it from their fathers;
018	JOB	015	019	Unto whom alone the earth was given, and into whose midst no stranger ever entered.
018	JOB	015	020	All his days is the wicked plagued with pain, and the number of years which are laid by for the tyrant.
018	JOB	015	021	A sound of terrors is in his ears: during peace will the waster come over him.
018	JOB	015	022	He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is looked for by the sword.
018	JOB	015	023	He wandereth abroad for bread, [saying,] Where is it? he knoweth that there is ready at his hand the day of darkness.
018	JOB	015	024	Distress and anguish terrify him: they assail him with might, as a king prepared for the battle.
018	JOB	015	025	Because he had stretched out against God his hand, and strengthened himself against the Almighty;
018	JOB	015	026	[And] he had run against him, with an [extended] neck, with the thick roundings of his bucklers;
018	JOB	015	027	Because he had covered his face with his fat, and had made thick folds of fat on his flanks;
018	JOB	015	028	And he dwelt in abandoned cities, in houses which none inhabited, which were destined to be ruinous heaps.
018	JOB	015	029	[Yet] will he not remain rich, neither will his wealth endure, nor will he attain their perfection on earth.
018	JOB	015	030	He will never depart out of darkness: the flame shall dry up his shoots, and he will depart by the breath of God's mouth.
018	JOB	015	031	Let him that goeth astray not trust in vanity; for vanity will be what he obtaineth thereby.
018	JOB	015	032	Even before his time will it be overfull, and his branches will not be green.
018	JOB	015	033	He will shake off like the vine his unripe grapes, and cast off like the olive his blossoms.
018	JOB	015	034	For the assembly of hypocrites will remain desolate, and fire will consume the tents of bribery.
018	JOB	015	035	They conceive trouble, and bring forth wrong-doing, and their body prepareth deceit.
018	JOB	016	001	Then answered Job, and said,
018	JOB	016	002	I have heard many things such as these: troublesome comforters are ye all.
018	JOB	016	003	Shall there be any end to words of wind? or what compelleth thee that thou shouldst answer?
018	JOB	016	004	I also could well speak as ye do: if your soul were but in my soul's stead, I could overwhelm you with words, and could shake my head at you.
018	JOB	016	005	But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the condolence of my lips should restrain [your grief].
018	JOB	016	006	Though I were to speak, my pain would not be restrained; and though I should forbear, what will go away from me?
018	JOB	016	007	But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.
018	JOB	016	008	And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, they are my witnesses; and my leanness riseth up for me, giveth its testimony to my face.
018	JOB	016	009	In his wrath he teareth me to pieces, and assaileth me: he gnasheth over me with his teeth; my adversary sendeth threatening looks at me.
018	JOB	016	010	They now open wide against me their mouth; reproachfully they smite my cheek: altogether do they assemble against me.
018	JOB	016	011	God hath surrendered me to the unjust, and cast me down into the hands of the wicked.
018	JOB	016	012	I was at ease, but he hath crushed me; he hath also grasped me by the neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up unto himself as a mark;
018	JOB	016	013	His archers encompass me round about; he cleaveth my reins sunder, and doth not pity; he poureth out upon the ground my gall;
018	JOB	016	014	He breaketh me down with breach upon breach; he runneth against me like a mighty man.
018	JOB	016	015	Sackcloth have I sewed upon my skin, and my horn I roll in the dust.
018	JOB	016	016	My face gloweth from weeping, and on my eyelids resteth the shadow of death:
018	JOB	016	017	Not because any violence is in my hands, and while my prayer is pure.
018	JOB	016	018	Earth! do thou not cover up my blood, and let no place restrain my cry.
018	JOB	016	019	Even now, behold, my witness is in the heavens, and one that testifieth for me is on high.
018	JOB	016	020	Are my friends my defenders? unto God my eye poureth out [its tears].
018	JOB	016	021	And oh that a man might plead with God, as one son of earth with the other!
018	JOB	016	022	For when the numbered years are passed, then must I travel a path whence I cannot return.
018	JOB	017	001	My spirit is broken, my days are cut short, the grave is ready for me.
018	JOB	017	002	Yet truly those that mock are with me, and on their offendings must my eye rest.
018	JOB	017	003	And thou, [Creator!] attend, I pray thee, be my surety with thyself: who else is there that would strike hands with me?
018	JOB	017	004	For thou hast concealed their heart against intelligence: therefore art thou not exalted [through them].
018	JOB	017	005	Every one of them speaketh deceptively to his friends: may also the eyes of his children fail.
018	JOB	017	006	And he hath placed me here as a by-word unto nations; and I become openly as a place of abomination.
018	JOB	017	007	Therefore is my eye dim from vexation, and my limbs are all of them like a shadow.
018	JOB	017	008	Upright men must be astonished at this, and the innocent must arouse himself against the hypocrite.
018	JOB	017	009	Yet will the righteous hold firmly on to his way; and he that is clean of hands will acquire additional strength.
018	JOB	017	010	But all of you, do only return, and come but [to me]: and yet I shall not find among you one wise man.
018	JOB	017	011	My days are past, my resolves are broken off, [even the thoughts]—the possessions of my heart.
018	JOB	017	012	These would change the night into day, the light as near in the presence of darkness.—
018	JOB	017	013	When I hope for the nether world as my house; in the darkness have I spread my couch;
018	JOB	017	014	When I call to corruption, Thou art my father: Thou art my mother, and my sister, to the worms.
018	JOB	017	015	Ay, where is then my hope? as for my hope, who will see it [fulfilled]?
018	JOB	017	016	Let then my limbs sink down to the nether world: truly in the dust alone there is rest for all.
018	JOB	018	001	Then answered Bildad the Shuchite, and said,
018	JOB	018	002	When will ye at length put an end to words? Come to an understanding, and afterward let us speak.
018	JOB	018	003	For what cause are we counted as beasts, reputed stupid your eyes?
018	JOB	018	004	Thou, the one that teareth himself to pieces in his anger— shall for thy sake the earth be forsaken, and the rock be moved away out of its place?
018	JOB	018	005	Ah, truly the light of the wicked will be quenched, and the spark of his fire shall not give light.
018	JOB	018	006	The light becometh dark in his tent, and his lamp will be quenched above him.
018	JOB	018	007	His powerful steps will be narrowed, and his own counsel will cast him down.
018	JOB	018	008	For he is driven into the net by his own feet, and he taketh his walk upon a snare.
018	JOB	018	009	The trap will seize him by the heel, and the robber will prevail over him.
018	JOB	018	010	The cord is hidden for him in the ground, and a trap is set for him on the pathway.
018	JOB	018	011	All around do terrors scare him, and chase him as he walketh along.
018	JOB	018	012	His first-born will suffer hunger, and calamity will be ready for his wife.
018	JOB	018	013	It will devour the limbs of his body: yea, the first-born of death will devour his limbs.
018	JOB	018	014	Then will be plucked up out of his tent his confidence, and [the evil] will urge him forward to the king of terrors.
018	JOB	018	015	It will dwell in his tent, because it is no more his: there will be strewed sulphur on his habitation.
018	JOB	018	016	Beneath, his roots will be dried up, and above will his boughs he cut away.
018	JOB	018	017	His resemblance vanisheth from the earth, and no name remaineth for him in the streets.
018	JOB	018	018	Men will thrust him out from light into darkness, and out of the world will they drive him.
018	JOB	018	019	He will have neither son nor grandson among his people, nor any that escapeth in the places of his sojourning.
018	JOB	018	020	Because of his [calamitous] day are they that come after him astonished, and they that went before are seized with shuddering.
018	JOB	018	021	Yea, such are the dwellings of the unjust, and this is the place of one that knew not God.
018	JOB	019	001	Then answered Job, and said,
018	JOB	019	002	How long will ye grieve my soul, and crush me with words?
018	JOB	019	003	These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed when ye show yourselves as strangers to me.
018	JOB	019	004	Yea, if it be indeed that I have erred, let my error remain with myself.
018	JOB	019	005	But if indeed ye wish to magnify yourselves above me, and to prove against me my disgrace:
018	JOB	019	006	Then know for certain that God hath bent me down, and hath laid his net all around me.
018	JOB	019	007	Behold, I cry out concerning the violence [done me], but I am not answered: I entreat aloud, but there is no justice.
018	JOB	019	008	My road hath he fenced up, so that I cannot pass out; and on my paths he placeth darkness.
018	JOB	019	009	My glory hath he stripped from me, and removed the crown of my head.
018	JOB	019	010	He hath pulled me down on every side, and I am going hence; and he hath rooted up like a tree my hope.
018	JOB	019	011	He hath also kindled against me his wrath, and he counteth me with himself as one of his adversaries.
018	JOB	019	012	Altogether come on his troops, and make level against me their way, and encamp round about my tent.
018	JOB	019	013	My brothers hath he removed far from me, and my acquaintance are entirely estranged from me.
018	JOB	019	014	My near of kin have withdrawn, and those befriended by me have forgotten me.
018	JOB	019	015	Ye that sojourn in my house, and my maid-servants, regard me as a stranger: an alien am I become in their eyes.
018	JOB	019	016	I call for my servant, but he will not answer, though I were to entreat him with my mouth.
018	JOB	019	017	My breath is become nauseous to my wife, and my caressing, to the children of my own body.
018	JOB	019	018	Yea, children even despise me: I rise up, but they speak against me.
018	JOB	019	019	All that have had my confidence abominate me; and those whom I have loved are turned against me.
018	JOB	019	020	To my skin and to my flesh my bones do cleave, and I must sustain myself with the gums of my teeth.
018	JOB	019	021	Spare me, spare me, O ye, my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.
018	JOB	019	022	Why will ye persecute me as God [hath done], and will never be satisfied with my flesh?
018	JOB	019	023	Oh who would but grant, that my words might be written down! oh who would grant that they were entered in a book!
018	JOB	019	024	That they were hewn with an iron pen and [blackened with] lead for eternity in the hard rock!
018	JOB	019	025	And well I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he will remain as the last after the creatures of the dust [are passed away];
018	JOB	019	026	And after my skin is cut to pieces will this be: and then freed from my body shall I behold God;
018	JOB	019	027	Whom I shall myself behold to my happiness, and whom my eyes will see, and not as a stranger, [when even] my reins are consumed within my bosom.
018	JOB	019	028	But if ye should say, How will we pursue him? seeing the root of the matter is found in me:
018	JOB	019	029	Then have dread for yourselves of the sword; for the wrath [which ye excite] is an iniquity that bringeth the sword; in order that ye may know there is one that judgeth [in the world].
018	JOB	020	001	Then answered Zophar the Na'amathite, and said,
018	JOB	020	002	Even therefore do my inmost thoughts give me an answer, and for this reason do I feel a strong excitement within me.
018	JOB	020	003	Reproof which casteth shame on me must I hear; yet out of my understanding will the spirit give me an answer.
018	JOB	020	004	Dost thou know this? from the very beginning of things, from the very time when man was placed upon earth it was,
018	JOB	020	005	That the triumphal shouting of the wicked is ever of but a recent date, and the joy of the hypocrite endureth only for a moment.
018	JOB	020	006	Though his exaltation should mount up to the heavens, and his head should reach unto the clouds;
018	JOB	020	007	Yet when he but turneth round will he vanish for ever; those who have seen him will say, Where is he?
018	JOB	020	008	Like a dream will he fly away, and men will find him no more; yea, he will be chased away like a vision of the night.
018	JOB	020	009	If an eye have surveyed him, it will not do so again, and it will not behold him any more in his place.
018	JOB	020	010	His children will suffer oppression from the indigent, and his hands will have to restore his [ill-gotten] wealth.
018	JOB	020	011	[Now] his bones are full of his youthful vigor; but it will [suddenly] lie down with him in the dust.
018	JOB	020	012	If the evil be sweet in his mouth, he will conceal it under his tongue;
018	JOB	020	013	He will cherish it, and not forsake it; and hold it back within his palate;
018	JOB	020	014	His food is thus changed within his bowels, and becometh the venom of asps within him.
018	JOB	020	015	The wealth which he hath swallowed, will he have to vomit up again; God will drive it out of his belly.
018	JOB	020	016	The poison of asps will he have to suck; the viper's tongue will slay him.
018	JOB	020	017	He shall not look with pleasure on streams, on flowing brooks of honey and cream.
018	JOB	020	018	He restoreth what he hath labored for, and will not swallow it down; however much he may have obtained by toil, he will not have any joy of it.
018	JOB	020	019	Because he oppressed and forsook the indigent; because he took violently away a house, shall he not rebuild it;
018	JOB	020	020	Because he knew not quietness in his bosom, shall he not escape through what is the most precious to him.
018	JOB	020	021	Nothing was spared from his craving to eat: therefore shall his wealth not prosper.
018	JOB	020	022	In the fulness of his abundance will distress assail him: every hand of [those he] troubled will come against him.
018	JOB	020	023	In order to fill his belly, [God] will send out against him the fury of his wrath, and will rain it upon him for his eating.
018	JOB	020	024	If he flee from the iron weapon, the brazen bow will strike him through.
018	JOB	020	025	He draweth it, and it cometh out of the body; yea, out of his gall the glittering [arrow] cometh forth: over him come the terrors [of death].
018	JOB	020	026	Entire darkness is laid by for his treasures: a fire not urged by blowing will consume him; it will destroy any one that is left in his tent.
018	JOB	020	027	The heavens will lay open his iniquity; and the earth will raise herself up against him.
018	JOB	020	028	The product of his house will be banished, flowing away on the day of his wrath.
018	JOB	020	029	This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and his decreed heritage from God.
018	JOB	021	001	Then answered Job, and said,
018	JOB	021	002	Hear, O hear my speech, and let this be wherewith you give consolations.
018	JOB	021	003	Bear with me that I may indeed speak: and after my speaking, then canst thou mock.
018	JOB	021	004	As for me, —is against man my complaint? and if this be so, why should my spirit not be impatient?
018	JOB	021	005	Turn yourselves unto me, and be astounded, and lay your hand upon your mouth.
018	JOB	021	006	Yea, when I think of it, I am terrified, and shuddering seizeth hold of my flesh.
018	JOB	021	007	Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, grow strong in power?
018	JOB	021	008	Their seed is firmly established in their presence with them. their offspring are before their eyes.
018	JOB	021	009	Their houses are at peace without any dread, and no rod of God [cometh] over them.
018	JOB	021	010	The bull of each one gendereth, and disappointeth not: the cow of each one calveth, and casteth not her young.
018	JOB	021	011	They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children skip about [with joy].
018	JOB	021	012	They sing to the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the pipe.
018	JOB	021	013	They wear out their days in happiness, and in a moment they go down to the nether world.
018	JOB	021	014	And yet they say unto God, “Depart from us; and the knowledge of thy ways we desire not.
018	JOB	021	015	What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit shall we have, if we entreat him urgently?”
018	JOB	021	016	Lo, not in their hand doth their happiness rest! The counsel of the wicked be [still] far from me.
018	JOB	021	017	How often is the lamp of the wicked quenched? and how often cometh over them their calamity? and doth [God] distribute their lot in his anger?
018	JOB	021	018	Are they as straw before the wind, and as chaff which the stealeth away?
018	JOB	021	019	Should God lay up for his children his wrong-doing? it were better that he reward him, that he might know it himself.
018	JOB	021	020	His own eyes ought to see his downfall, and from the wrath of the Almighty ought he to drink.
018	JOB	021	021	For what care hath he for his household after him, when the number of his months is all apportioned to him?
018	JOB	021	022	Is this fitting God, who teacheth knowledge? him who judgeth those that are highest?
018	JOB	021	023	That this one dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet;
018	JOB	021	024	His vessels being full of healthy fluid, and the marrow of his bones being well moistened:
018	JOB	021	025	While this other dieth with an embittered soul, and hath never partaken of any happiness;
018	JOB	021	026	[And yet] together they must lie down in the dust, and the worms will cover them?
018	JOB	021	027	Behold, I know your thoughts, and the opinions which ye wrongfully devise against me.
018	JOB	021	028	For ye say, Where is the house of the noble-minded? and where is the tent of the dwelling-places of the wicked?
018	JOB	021	029	Have ye not asked the wayfarers? surely their token ye cannot disregard,
018	JOB	021	030	That the bad man is reserved for the day of calamity, [that the wicked] are carried forward to the day of wrath.
018	JOB	021	031	[But] who will tell him to his face of his way? and who will repay him what he hath done?
018	JOB	021	032	Yea he will indeed be carried to the grave, and men will quickly think of his monument:
018	JOB	021	033	Sweet are to him the clods of the valley; and after him succeedeth every man, as those that were before him are without number.
018	JOB	021	034	How then will ye comfort me with vanity? and of your answers there remaineth only deception.
018	JOB	022	001	Then answered Eliphaz the Themanite, and said,
018	JOB	022	002	Can a man be serviceable unto God? Truly the intelligent is serviceable unto himself.
018	JOB	022	003	Is it any pleasure to the Almighty that thou art righteous? or is it any gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect?
018	JOB	022	004	Is it out of fear of thee that he will reproach thee? or go with thee into judgment?
018	JOB	022	005	Is not thy evil great? and no end to thy iniquities?
018	JOB	022	006	For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brothers for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing.
018	JOB	022	007	Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and from the hungry thou hast withholden bread.
018	JOB	022	008	But as for the man of a strong arm, he obtained the land, and the highly honored could dwell therein.
018	JOB	022	009	Widows hast thou sent away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.
018	JOB	022	010	Therefore are snares round about thee, and sudden dread terrifieth thee.
018	JOB	022	011	Or seest thou not the darkness? and the abundance of water which covereth thee?
018	JOB	022	012	Is not God in the height of heaven? and beholding the highest elevation of the stars, however high they are?
018	JOB	022	013	But thou sayest, “What doth God know? can he judge behind the darkness?
018	JOB	022	014	Thick clouds are a covering for him, so that he will not see; and he walketh along on the circle of heaven.”
018	JOB	022	015	Wilt thou [thus] observe the path of ancient times which the men of injustice have trodden?
018	JOB	022	016	Who were shrivelled up before their time, whose foundation was flooded away like a river;
018	JOB	022	017	Who said unto God, “'Depart from us:” and what wrought the Almighty for them?
018	JOB	022	018	And yet it was he that filled their houses with good things; but the counsel of the wicked be [still] far from me.
018	JOB	022	019	The righteous will see it, and be glad; and the innocent will laugh them to scorn.
018	JOB	022	020	“Is not he destroyed that rose up against us, and hath not the fire consumed what they had left?”
018	JOB	022	021	Do but become acquainted with him, and be at peace: thereby will happiness come unto thee.
018	JOB	022	022	Do but accept instruction from his mouth, and lay up his saying in thy heart.
018	JOB	022	023	If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, so thou wilt but remove wrong-doing far away from thy tents.
018	JOB	022	024	And throw down in the dust precious metals, and [the gold of] Ophir to the stones of the brooks:
018	JOB	022	025	Then will the Almighty be thy precious metal, and brightly-shining silver unto thee.
018	JOB	022	026	For then wilt thou have in the Almighty thy delight, and thou canst lift up unto God thy face.
018	JOB	022	027	Thou wilt make entreaty unto him, and he will hear thee, and thy vows wilt thou pay.
018	JOB	022	028	And if thou decree a thing, it will be fulfilled unto thee; and upon thy ways the light will shine.
018	JOB	022	029	For when men are brought low, thou wilt say, Pride [hath done it]; but those of lowly eyes [God] will help.
018	JOB	022	030	He will even deliver him who is not guiltless: and thou wilt be delivered by the purity of thy hands.
018	JOB	023	001	Then answered Job, and said,
018	JOB	023	002	Even now is my complaint bitter: my suffering is heavier than my groans.
018	JOB	023	003	Oh who would grant that I knew where I might find him! that I might attain to his Judgment throne!
018	JOB	023	004	I would put in order before him my cause, and my mouth would I fill with arguments.
018	JOB	023	005	I should know the words which he might answer me, and understand what he might say unto me.
018	JOB	023	006	Would he with his power contend against me? he would truly not lay such doings to my charge.
018	JOB	023	007	There would an upright one argue with him; and I should be allowed to escape for ever by my judge.
018	JOB	023	008	But, lo, I go eastward—and he is not there; and to the west— and I cannot perceive him;
018	JOB	023	009	When he doth great things at the north, I behold him not; he hideth himself in the south—and I see him not.
018	JOB	023	010	But he knoweth the way that I take: were he to probe me, I should come forth as gold.
018	JOB	023	011	On his steps my foot hath held fast: his way have I kept, and swerved not.
018	JOB	023	012	From the commandment of his lips have I also not moved away: as a fixed statute for me have I treasured up the sayings of his mouth.
018	JOB	023	013	But he is unchangeably one, and who can turn him? And what his will desireth, even that he doth.
018	JOB	023	014	For he will bring to completion what hath been destined for me: and like these hath he many other things with him.
018	JOB	023	015	Therefore am I terrified at his presence: I will reflect, and be in dread of him.
018	JOB	023	016	Still God hath made timid my heart, and the Almighty hath terrified me;
018	JOB	023	017	Because I was not destroyed before this darkness, and because he hath not hidden from my face [this] gloom.
018	JOB	024	001	Why are not times [of punishment] treasured up by the Almighty, and why do his adorers not see his days [of retribution]?
018	JOB	024	002	[The wicked] remove landmarks: they rob flocks, and feed them.
018	JOB	024	003	They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take in pledge the widow's ox.
018	JOB	024	004	They chase the needy out of the highway: altogether hide themselves the poor of the earth.
018	JOB	024	005	Behold, as wild asses in the wilderness go they forth to their work, rising betimes after [their] prey: the desert yieldeth food for them and for their young men.
018	JOB	024	006	In the field they reap their food; and in the vineyard of the wicked they gather the fruit.
018	JOB	024	007	They cause [the poor] to spend the night naked, without clothing and without any covering in the cold.
018	JOB	024	008	Through the sweeping rain of the mountains are they made wet, and for want of a shelter do they embrace the rock.
018	JOB	024	009	The others pluck from the breast the fatherless, and the garment of the poor they take in pledge.
018	JOB	024	010	They cause him to go naked without clothing, and from the hungry they take away the sheaf:
018	JOB	024	011	Within their walls do they make oil, they tread their wine-presses, and suffer thirst.
018	JOB	024	012	Out of a populous city is groaning heard, and the soul of the deadly wounded crieth out: yet God regardeth it not as an offence.
018	JOB	024	013	Yon men are of those that rebel against the light: they know not its ways, nor abide in its paths.
018	JOB	024	014	With the earliest light riseth the murderer, he slayeth the poor and needy, and in the night he becometh like the thief.
018	JOB	024	015	And the eye of the adulterer watcheth for the twilight, saying, No eye will see me; and placeth a covering on his face.
018	JOB	024	016	They break into houses in the dark, in the daytime they lock themselves in: they know not the light.
018	JOB	024	017	For to all of these alike is the morning as the shadow of death; for they are familiar with the terrors of the shadow of death.
018	JOB	024	018	Swift are such men [to flee] on the face of the water; accursed is their field on the land; none of them turneth himself to the way, of the vineyards.
018	JOB	024	019	Drought and heat speedily consume the snow-waters: so doth the grave those who have sinned.
018	JOB	024	020	The mother that bore such a one will forget him; the worm will feed sweetly on him; he will be no more remembered; and like a tree will wickedness be broken.
018	JOB	024	021	He ill-treateth the barren that heareth not; and to the widow he acteth not well.
018	JOB	024	022	But he also draweth down the mighty with his power: he riseth up, no one is sure of life.
018	JOB	024	023	To such [God] granteth to be in safety, that he may find support; and His eyes are upon their ways.
018	JOB	024	024	They are exalted; in but a little while they are no more; and they are brought down low: like all others are they gathered in, and like the top of the ear of corn are they cut off.
018	JOB	024	025	But if it be not so, who will prove me a liar, and render nought my word?
018	JOB	025	001	Then answered Bildad the Shuchite, and said,
018	JOB	025	002	Dominion and dread are with him: he maketh peace in high places.
018	JOB	025	003	Can the number of his hosts be given? and over whom riseth not his light?
018	JOB	025	004	How then can man be justified with God? or how can be one that is born of woman?
018	JOB	025	005	Behold, even as regardeth the moon, that is not bright; yea, the stars are not pure in his eyes.
018	JOB	025	006	How much less the mortal, the mere worm? and the son of earth, the mere maggot?
018	JOB	026	001	Then answered Job, and said,
018	JOB	026	002	What assistance hast thou given to the powerless? [how] hast thou helped the arm without strength?
018	JOB	026	003	How hast thou counselled the unwise? and what sound wisdom hast thou made known so plentifully?
018	JOB	026	004	To whom hast thou told words? and whose spirit came from thee?
018	JOB	026	005	The departed are called into being beneath the waters, and their inhabitants.
018	JOB	026	006	Naked is the nether world before him, and there is no covering for the place of corruption.
018	JOB	026	007	He stretched out the north over empty space; he suspended the earth on nothing;
018	JOB	026	008	He bound up the waters in his clouds; and the cloud bursteth not under their weight;
018	JOB	026	009	He closed up the surface of his throne, spreading over it his cloud;
018	JOB	026	010	A fixed limit he compassed off over the face of the waters, for the division of the light and darkness.
018	JOB	026	011	The pillars of heaven tremble greatly, and are astounded at his rebuke.
018	JOB	026	012	By his power he split in pieces the sea, and by his understanding he crushed [its] pride:
018	JOB	026	013	By his breath the heavens [acquired] beauty; his hand hath created the flying serpent.
018	JOB	026	014	Lo, these are ends of his ways; for how slight a whisper is heard [by us] of him! but the thunder of his mighty deeds who can understand?
018	JOB	027	001	And Job continued taking up his parable, and said,
018	JOB	027	002	As God liveth, who hath removed justice from me; and by the Almighty, who hath embittered my soul:
018	JOB	027	003	All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils;
018	JOB	027	004	Shall my lips not speak any wrong, nor shall my tongue utter deceit.
018	JOB	027	005	Far be it from me that I should justify you; till I depart hence will I not allow [any one] to take my integrity away from me.
018	JOB	027	006	I have laid fast hold on my righteousness, and I will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me [for my conduct] during all my life.
018	JOB	027	007	Like the wicked is [therefore] my enemy, and he that riseth up against me like a wrong-doer.
018	JOB	027	008	For what is the hope of the hypocrite, when he hath gained unjust wealth, when God casteth forth his soul?
018	JOB	027	009	Will God hear his cry, when distress cometh upon him?
018	JOB	027	010	Or can he find delight in the Almighty? can he call on God at all times?
018	JOB	027	011	I will instruct you concerning what is in the hand of God: [the way] which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.
018	JOB	027	012	Lo! ye yourselves have all beheld it: why is it then that ye deal in such vanities?
018	JOB	027	013	This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the portion of tyrants, which they shall receive from the Almighty.
018	JOB	027	014	If his children be multiplied, it is only for the sword; and his offspring will not be satisfied with bread.
018	JOB	027	015	Those of his that are left to escape will be buried by death; and his widows will not be able to weep.
018	JOB	027	016	Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare garments [as plentifully] as the clay:
018	JOB	027	017	He may prepare, but the righteous will clothe himself [therewith], and the silver the innocent will divide.
018	JOB	027	018	He buildeth his house like the moth, and like a hut that a keeper hath made.
018	JOB	027	019	Rich will he lie down, but will not be gathered [into the grave]: one openeth his eyes, and he is no more.
018	JOB	027	020	Like a flood will terror overtake him, in the night a tempest will steal him away.
018	JOB	027	021	The east wind will lift him up, and he must be gone; and it hurleth him like a storm out of his place.
018	JOB	027	022	And [God] will cast [evil] upon him, and bare no pity: out of his hand [his wealth] will surely escape.
018	JOB	027	023	Men will clap their hands over him, and will hiss after him out of his place.
018	JOB	028	001	For truly there is a source for the silver, and a place for the gold which men refine.
018	JOB	028	002	Iron is taken out of the dust, and the stone is melted into copper.
018	JOB	028	003	An end doth he set to darkness, and the very utmost limit doth he search out, the stones of darkness, and of the shadow of death.
018	JOB	028	004	He breaketh a channel far from the inhabited place; those of unsteady foot, the poorest of men move [there about].
018	JOB	028	005	The earth, out of which cometh forth bread, is under its surface turned up as it were with fire.
018	JOB	028	006	Her stones are the place whence the sapphire cometh; and golden dust is also there;
018	JOB	028	007	[On the] path which no bird of prey knoweth, and which the vulture's eye hath not surveyed;
018	JOB	028	008	[Which] ravenous beasts have never trodden, over which the lion hath never passed.
018	JOB	028	009	To the flinty rock he stretcheth forth his hand; he overturneth the mountains from the root.
018	JOB	028	010	Amid rocks he heweth out canals: and every precious thing doth his eye behold.
018	JOB	028	011	The various droppings of water he uniteth into streams, and what is hidden he bringeth forth to light.
018	JOB	028	012	But wisdom—where shall she he found? and where is the place of understanding?
018	JOB	028	013	Man knoweth not her value: and she is not to be found in the land of the living.
018	JOB	028	014	The deep saith, Not in me is she: and the sea saith, She is not with me.
018	JOB	028	015	No fine gold can be given in lieu of her, and silver cannot be weighed out as her price.
018	JOB	028	016	She cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.
018	JOB	028	017	She cannot be estimated after gold and glass; and not in exchange for her [can] vessels of refined gold [be taken.]
018	JOB	028	018	Coral and crystal will not be thought of; and the value of wisdom is above pearls.
018	JOB	028	019	She cannot be estimated after the topaz of Ethiopia, nor can she be valued with pure gold.
018	JOB	028	020	But wisdom—whence cometh she? and where is the place of understanding?
018	JOB	028	021	Yea, she is hidden from the eyes of all living, and from the fowls of the heavens is she concealed.
018	JOB	028	022	Perdition and death say, With our ears have we heard a report of her.
018	JOB	028	023	God [alone] understandeth her way, and he knoweth her place;
018	JOB	028	024	For he looketh to the ends of the earth, [whatever is] under the whole heaven doth he see.
018	JOB	028	025	When he imparted weight unto the wind; and [when] the waters he established by measure;
018	JOB	028	026	When he made a law for the rain, and a way for the lightning of [his] thunders;
018	JOB	028	027	Then did he see her, and make her known; he established her, and also searched her out.
018	JOB	028	028	And he said unto man, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to eschew evil is understanding.
018	JOB	029	001	And Job continued to take up his parable, and said,
018	JOB	029	002	Who will give me back months like those which are past, days like those when God guarded me;
018	JOB	029	003	When his lamp shone over my head, when by his light I could walk in darkness;
018	JOB	029	004	As I was in the days of my abundance, when the confidence of God was upon my tent:
018	JOB	029	005	When the Almighty was yet with me, when my servants stood round about me;
018	JOB	029	006	When I bathed my steps in cream, and the rock poured out near me streamlets of oil!
018	JOB	029	007	When I went out to the gate close by the city, when in the open place I established my seat:
018	JOB	029	008	Young men saw me, and hid themselves; and the aged rose up, and remained standing;
018	JOB	029	009	Princes stopped in the midst of [their] words, and laid their hand on their mouth:
018	JOB	029	010	The voice of nobles was arrested, and their tongue cleaved to their palate.
018	JOB	029	011	For the ear that heard me called me happy; and the eye that saw me bore witness for me;
018	JOB	029	012	Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, yea, that had none to help him.
018	JOB	029	013	The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me; and the heart of the widow I caused to sing for joy.
018	JOB	029	014	I took righteousness as my garment, and it clothed me: as a robe and a mitre was justice unto me.
018	JOB	029	015	Eyes was I to the blind; and feet to the lame was I.
018	JOB	029	016	A father was I to the needy; and the cause of him I knew not I used to investigate.
018	JOB	029	017	And I broke the cutting-teeth of the wrong-doer, and out of his teeth I cast down his prey.
018	JOB	029	018	And I said then, “In the midst of my nest shall I depart hence, and like the sand shall I have many days.
018	JOB	029	019	My root will stand open for the water, and the dew will lodge on my boughs.
018	JOB	029	020	My glory will ever be new with me, and my bow will acquire fresh strength in my hand.”
018	JOB	029	021	Unto me men listened, and waited, and watched in silence for my counsel
018	JOB	029	022	After my words they made no reply, and my speech dropped on them [like dew].
018	JOB	029	023	And they waited for me as for the rain, and they opened wide their mouth as for the latter rain.
018	JOB	029	024	I smiled on those that had lost their confidence; and the light of my countenance they never cast down.
018	JOB	029	025	I chose their way for them, and I sat as chief, and dwelt as king in his army, as one that comforteth mourners.
018	JOB	030	001	But now they who are younger than I in years laugh at me, whose fathers I scorned to put as equals with the dogs of my flocks.
018	JOB	030	002	Yea, what possible use can the strength of their hands be unto me, over whom old age hath passed fruitlessly?
018	JOB	030	003	Who suffer for want and famine in solitude; who flee into the wilderness [where all is] darkness, ruin, and desolation;
018	JOB	030	004	Who crop off mallows by the bushes, and have broom-bush roots as their bread;
018	JOB	030	005	Who are driven forth from among [men], who are shouted after as though they were thieves,
018	JOB	030	006	To dwell in the caverns of the valleys, in holes of the earth, and on naked cliffs.
018	JOB	030	007	Among the bushes they shriek; under briers they are huddled together,
018	JOB	030	008	The children of the worthless, yea, the children of the nameless, who were outcasts from the land.
018	JOB	030	009	But now I am become their song, and I am become a byword unto them.
018	JOB	030	010	They loathe me, they keep themselves far from me, and from my face they withhold not their spittle.
018	JOB	030	011	Because he hath loosened the cord of my bow, and afflicted me, they have also cast off the bridle before me.
018	JOB	030	012	Against my right hand rise up this swarm of worthless youths: they push away my feet, and they level against me their calamity-bringing paths.
018	JOB	030	013	They destroy my footpath, they help forward my downfall, without any one to aid them.
018	JOB	030	014	As [through] a broad breach they come: amidst a loud noise they rolled themselves along.
018	JOB	030	015	Terrors have turned their face against me; they chase like the wind my glory: and like a cloud is my happiness passed away.
018	JOB	030	016	And now my soul is poured out over me; the days of affliction have seized on me;
018	JOB	030	017	All night it holloweth out my bones out of my body; and my pursuers take no rest.
018	JOB	030	018	Through the Almlghty's power is my garment made unknown: like the opening of my coat hath he enclosed me.
018	JOB	030	019	He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.
018	JOB	030	020	I cry aloud unto thee, but thou answerest me not: I stand up, and thou fixest thy regard against me.
018	JOB	030	021	Thou art changed into a cruel master toward me: with the strength of thy hand thou assailest me.
018	JOB	030	022	Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to pass away, and dissolvest in me all wise counsel.
018	JOB	030	023	For I know that thou wilt bring me back to death, and to the house of assembly for all the living.
018	JOB	030	024	But doth not a man stretch out his hand among ruins? or doth one not cry out therefrom [for help] when he meeteth his downfall?
018	JOB	030	025	Did I not weep for him that was hard pressed by misfortune? was not my soul grieved for the needy?
018	JOB	030	026	That I hoped for good, but there came evil; and I waited for light, and there came darkness!
018	JOB	030	027	My bowels heave, and rest not: the days of affliction have overcome me.
018	JOB	030	028	I walk about mournfully without sunlight: when I rise up, in the assembly, I cry with pain.
018	JOB	030	029	I am a brother to [howling] monsters, and a companion to ostriches.
018	JOB	030	030	My skin hangeth down black from me, and my bones are burnt from heat.
018	JOB	030	031	And thus is changed to mourning my harp, and my pipe to the sound of weeping.
018	JOB	031	001	A covenant had I made with my eyes: how then should I fix my look on a virgin?
018	JOB	031	002	And what then would have been my portion of God from above? and what lot of the Almighty from on high?
018	JOB	031	003	Is not calamity [ready] for the unjust? and misfortune for the wrong-doers?
018	JOB	031	004	Behold, he truly seeth my ways, and numbereth all my steps;
018	JOB	031	005	[And knoweth] whether I have walked with vain desires, or if my foot hath hastened after deceit.
018	JOB	031	006	Let him weigh me then in a righteous balance, and let God acknowledge my integrity,
018	JOB	031	007	If my step have turned aside from the [proper] way, and my heart have walked after my eyes, and if any blemish have cleaved to my hands:
018	JOB	031	008	Then let me sow, and let another eat; and let what I have growing be rooted out.
018	JOB	031	009	If my heart have been beguiled toward a woman, or if I have lain in wait at my neighbor's door:
018	JOB	031	010	Then may my wife labor at the mill for another, and may strangers ill-use her;
018	JOB	031	011	For this would be incest; yea, it would be an iniquity [to be punished by] the judges;
018	JOB	031	012	For it would be a fire that consumeth down to the place of corruption, and would root out all my products.
018	JOB	031	013	If ever I cast aside the justice due to my man-servant and my maid-servant, when they contended with me:
018	JOB	031	014	What then could I do when God should rise up? and when he should investigate, what could I answer him?
018	JOB	031	015	Did not he that made me make him born or a woman? and did not the same one fashion us in the womb?
018	JOB	031	016	If ever I denied the wish of the indigent, or ever allowed the eyes of the widow to fall [in vain hopes];
018	JOB	031	017	Or if ever I ate my bread by myself alone, and the fatherless did not eat thereof;
018	JOB	031	018	(For from my youth he was brought up with me, as though we were of one father, and I have guided her [as though she was sprung] from my mother's womb;)
018	JOB	031	019	If ever I saw any one perishing for want of clothing, or the needy without covering:
018	JOB	031	020	If his loins have not blessed me, and if he have not been warmed with the fleece of my sheep;
018	JOB	031	021	If I have swung my hand against the fatherless, because I saw in the gate those that would help me:
018	JOB	031	022	Then may my shoulder fall from my shoulder-blade, and my arm be broken from the channel-bone;
018	JOB	031	023	For dreaded by me was the calamitous punishment of God, and against his highness I can accomplish nothing.
018	JOB	031	024	If I have made gold my confidence, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my trust:
018	JOB	031	025	If ever I rejoiced because my wealth was abundant, and because my hand had gotten much;
018	JOB	031	026	If ever I looked at the light [of the sun] when he shone brightly and on the moon walking in splendor:
018	JOB	031	027	And my heart became misled in secret, and my hand kissed my mouth:
018	JOB	031	028	This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge; for thus would I have denied the God that is above.
018	JOB	031	029	If ever I rejoiced at the downfall of him that hated me, or was elated when evil befell him; —
018	JOB	031	030	But I suffered not my mouth to sin by denouncing with a curse his soul: —
018	JOB	031	031	If the men of my tent said not, Oh is there one that is not satisfied of his flesh; —
018	JOB	031	032	In the street a stranger had not to lodge; my doors I held open to the roadside;
018	JOB	031	033	If I covered up my transgressions like a common man, by hiding in my bosom my iniquity;
018	JOB	031	034	Because I dreaded the great multitude, or because the contempt of families did terrify me, so that I kept silence, and dared not to go out of the door; —
018	JOB	031	035	Oh who will bring me one that would hear me! behold, here is my plea; may the Almighty answer me; and any record which my opponent may have written, —
018	JOB	031	036	Surely upon my shoulder would I carry it: I would bind it as a crown unto me.
018	JOB	031	037	The number of my steps would I tell him: as [to] a prince would I go near unto him.—
018	JOB	031	038	If my land ever cried out because of me, or if its furrows wept together;
018	JOB	031	039	If I ever consumed its strength without payment, or caused the soul of its owners to grieve:
018	JOB	031	040	Then may instead of wheat, thorns come forth, and instead of barley, cockle. (Here end the words of Job.)
018	JOB	032	001	So had these three men abstained from answering Job; because he was righteous in his own eyes.
018	JOB	032	002	Thereupon was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he had declared himself more righteous than God.
018	JOB	032	003	And against his three friends was his wrath kindled; because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.
018	JOB	032	004	Now Elihu had held back toward Job [his] words; because the others were older in days than he.
018	JOB	032	005	But when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then was his wrath kindled.
018	JOB	032	006	And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite commenced, and said, Young am I in days, and ye are very old: therefore I hesitated and feared to show you what I know.
018	JOB	032	007	I had said, Days shall speak, and multitude of years shall make wisdom known.
018	JOB	032	008	But it is the spirit in man, and the breath of the Almighty which giveth them understanding.
018	JOB	032	009	Not those rich in years must be always wise: neither do the aged constantly understand what is just.
018	JOB	032	010	Therefore do I say, Hearken to me: I also will show forth what I know myself.
018	JOB	032	011	Behold, I waited for your words: I gave an attentive ear to your reasonings, till you might have searched out the [proper] words.
018	JOB	032	012	And now I understand you fully, and, behold, there is none that convinceth Job, or, that answereth his speeches among you.
018	JOB	032	013	Say then not, We have found wisdom: God will thrust him down, not man.
018	JOB	032	014	But he hath not directed any words against me: and with your speeches will I not answer him.
018	JOB	032	015	They are dismayed, they answer no more: words have escaped away from them.
018	JOB	032	016	And should I wait [longer], because they cannot speak, because they stand stilt and answer no more?
018	JOB	032	017	[But] I also will surely answer my part, I myself also will show forth what I know;
018	JOB	032	018	For I am full of words, the spirit in my bosom urgeth me hard.
018	JOB	032	019	Behold, my bosom is like [fresh] wine which hath not been opened: like new bottles it is ready to burst.
018	JOB	032	020	I will speak, that I may breathe freer: I will open my lips and answer.
018	JOB	032	021	On no account will I show undue favor to any man, and to no son of earth will I give flattering titles.
018	JOB	032	022	For I know not to give flattering titles; [for else] my Maker would speedily carry me away.
018	JOB	033	001	Therefore do thou but hear, O Job, my speeches, and give ear to all my words.
018	JOB	033	002	Behold now, I have opened my mouth, my tongue speaketh in my mouth.
018	JOB	033	003	Out of my straightforward heart [come] my sayings, and my lips utter knowledge clearly.
018	JOB	033	004	The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty giveth me life.
018	JOB	033	005	If thou canst, answer me, array thyself before me, stand forward.
018	JOB	033	006	Behold, I am in the same relation as thyself toward God: I myself also am cut out of the clay.
018	JOB	033	007	Behold, dread of me cannot terrify thee, and my pressure will not be too heavy upon thee.
018	JOB	033	008	But thou hast said before my ears, and the sound of the words I still hear,
018	JOB	033	009	“I am pure without transgression, I am quite clean; and there is no iniquity in me:
018	JOB	033	010	Yet, behold, he findeth hateful backsliding on me, he regardeth me as an enemy unto him;
018	JOB	033	011	He putteth my feet in the stocks, he watcheth all my paths.”
018	JOB	033	012	Behold, In this thou art not just: I will answer thee; for God is far greater than a mortal.
018	JOB	033	013	Why dost thou contend against him? for with all his words will he not give an answer.
018	JOB	033	014	For God speaketh once, yea twice: [yet man] regardeth it not.
018	JOB	033	015	In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumbers upon the couch:
018	JOB	033	016	Then doth he lay open the ear of men, and sealeth it with their warning;
018	JOB	033	017	To remove the son of earth [from his intended] deed and he covereth up pride from man;
018	JOB	033	018	He withholdeth his soul from the pit, and his life from passing away by the sword.
018	JOB	033	019	And so is he admonished by pain upon his couch, and all his bones with violent [aches].
018	JOB	033	020	So that his inclination abhorreth bread, and his soul, the most agreeable food.
018	JOB	033	021	His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen, and his bones that were not seen stick out.
018	JOB	033	022	Yea, his soul draweth near unto the pit, and his life to those that slay.
018	JOB	033	023	If there be now about him one single angel, as defender, one out of a thousand, to tell for man his uprightness:
018	JOB	033	024	Then is he gracious unto him, and saith, Release him from going down to the pit, I have found an atonement.
018	JOB	033	025	His flesh becometh full again as in youth: he returneth to the days of his boyhood.
018	JOB	033	026	He will offer his entreaty unto God, and he will receive him in favor, that he may see his face with joy: so doth He recompense unto the mortal his righteousness.
018	JOB	033	027	He then should assemble men around, and say, “I had sinned, and perverted what is right, yet have I not received a like return.”
018	JOB	033	028	Thus he redeemeth his soul from passing into the pit, and his life will look joyously on the light.
018	JOB	033	029	Lo, all these things doth God two or three times with man;
018	JOB	033	030	To bring back his soul from the pit, that she may shine in the light of life.
018	JOB	033	031	Listen well, O Job, hearken unto me: keep silence, and I will truly speak.
018	JOB	033	032	If thou hast any words, answer me: speak, for I wish to justify thee.
018	JOB	033	033	If not, hearken thou unto me: keep silence, and I will teach thee wisdom.
018	JOB	034	001	And Elihu commenced, and said,
018	JOB	034	002	Hear, O ye wise men, my words; and ye that have knowledge, give ear unto me.
018	JOB	034	003	For the ear proveth words, as the palate tasteth the food.
018	JOB	034	004	Let us choose for ourselves what is just: let us acknowledge between ourselves what is good.
018	JOB	034	005	For Job hath said, “I am righteous; and God hath taken away justice from me.
018	JOB	034	006	Should I lie concerning the justice due me? incurable is [my wound from] the arrow I bear in me without any transgression.”
018	JOB	034	007	What man is there like Job, who drinketh scorning like water,
018	JOB	034	008	And is on the road to keep company with the wrong-doers, and to walk with men of wickedness?
018	JOB	034	009	For he hath said, “It profiteth a man nothing when he acteth according to the pleasure of God.”
018	JOB	034	010	Therefore ye men of sense hearken unto me: far is it from God to practise wickedness; and from the Almighty to do wrong!
018	JOB	034	011	For the work of a son of earth doth he recompense unto him, and according to the path of man doth he permit things to occur to him.
018	JOB	034	012	Yea, surely God will not condemn unjustly, nor will the Almighty pervert justice.
018	JOB	034	013	Who hath given him a charge concerning the earth? or who hath intrusted [him] the whole world?
018	JOB	034	014	If he were to set his heart upon man, he would gather unto himself his spirit and his breath:
018	JOB	034	015	All flesh would perish together, and the son of earth would return again unto dust.
018	JOB	034	016	If then thou wishest to understand, hear this: give ear to the sound of my words.
018	JOB	034	017	Is it possible that he who hateth justice should govern? or wilt thou condemn the righteous mighty One?
018	JOB	034	018	[Is it fit] to say to a king, Thou art worthless? and to princes, Ye are wicked?
018	JOB	034	019	Whereas he is one that showeth no favor to chieftains, and distinguisheth not the rich before the indigent; for all of them are the work of his hands.
018	JOB	034	020	In a moment will they die, and in the midst of the night; people are moved, and pass away: and the mighty will be removed without a human hand.
018	JOB	034	021	For big eyes are upon the ways of man, and all his steps doth he see.
018	JOB	034	022	There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the evil-doers can hide themselves.
018	JOB	034	023	For he need not direct [his attention] a long time upon man, that he should enter into judgment before God.
018	JOB	034	024	He breaketh down mighty men without [long] searching, and placeth others in their stead.
018	JOB	034	025	For the reason that he knoweth their deeds: therefore he overturneth them in the night, and they are crushed.
018	JOB	034	026	Among wicked men doth he strike them, in the place where [many] see them:
018	JOB	034	027	Because they have departed from following him, and have not considered all his ways.
018	JOB	034	028	Bringing before them the cry of the indigent, and the cry of the afflicted which he had to hear.
018	JOB	034	029	When he now granteth rest, who will condemn [him]! and when he hideth his face, who can behold him? whether it be against a nation, or against one man, it is the same:
018	JOB	034	030	That no hypocritical man may reign, that such shall not be a mare to the people.
018	JOB	034	031	For truly it is only fitting to say unto God, “I bear [cheerfully], I will not do any wrong;
018	JOB	034	032	What I cannot see myself, do thou truly teach me; if I have done what is unjust, I will do so no more.”
018	JOB	034	033	Should he then according to thy view send a recompense, because thou hast rejected him? “Because thou must choose, and not I?” and what thou knowest, do speak.
018	JOB	034	034	Men of sense will say unto me, and every wise man who heareth me,
018	JOB	034	035	That Job hath not spoken with knowledge, and that his words are without intelligence.
018	JOB	034	036	Oh that Job may therefore be probed continually, in order to give answers against sinful men.
018	JOB	034	037	For he addeth unto his sin transgression: among us he uttereth too many loud words, and multiplieth his speeches against God.
018	JOB	035	001	Then commenced Elihu, and said,
018	JOB	035	002	Dost thou deem this to be just, that thou hast said, “My righteousness is more than God's?”
018	JOB	035	003	For thou sayest, “What benefit will it be unto thee? what more profit shall I have, than if I had sinned?”
018	JOB	035	004	I will truly reply unto thee with words, and unto thy friends with thee.
018	JOB	035	005	Look unto the heavens, and see; and gaze on the skies which are higher than thou.
018	JOB	035	006	If thou sin, what dost thou effect against him? and if thy transgressions be multiplied, what canst thou do unto him?
018	JOB	035	007	If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what doth he accept out of thy hand?
018	JOB	035	008	A man like thyself thy wickedness may reach, and a son of earth thy righteousness.
018	JOB	035	009	By reason of the multitude of oppressions [the wicked] cause men to cry: these complain aloud because of the arm of the mighty.
018	JOB	035	010	But [man] saith not, Where is God my maker, who bestoweth joyful songs even in the night;
018	JOB	035	011	Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of the heavens?
018	JOB	035	012	There do they cry, but he answereth not: because of the pride of evil men.
018	JOB	035	013	Only what is false will God not hear, nor will the Almighty regard it.
018	JOB	035	014	Although thou sayest, thou canst not see him: yet the decision is before him; and do thou wait for him.
018	JOB	035	015	But now, because his anger hath punished nothing, shall he not greatly take cognizance of the multitude of sins?
018	JOB	035	016	But Job openeth wide his mouth for nought: without knowledge he heapeth up words.
018	JOB	036	001	Then continued Elihu, and said,
018	JOB	036	002	Wait for me a little, and I will instruct thee; for [I have] still some words on God's behalf.
018	JOB	036	003	I will lift up my knowledge for him who is afar, and for my Maker will I obtain righteousness.
018	JOB	036	004	For truly no falsehood is [in] my words: one that is upright in [his] opinions [dealeth now] with thee.
018	JOB	036	005	Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength of intellect.
018	JOB	036	006	He permitteth not the wicked to live; but he procureth justice for the afflicted.
018	JOB	036	007	He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous; but [he placeth them] with kings on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.
018	JOB	036	008	And if they be bound in fetters, and if they be entangled in the cords of affliction:
018	JOB	036	009	Then doth he tell them of their work, and of their transgressions, when they had become strong.
018	JOB	036	010	And he openeth thus their ear to correction, and saith that they should return from wrong-doing.
018	JOB	036	011	If they hearken and serve [him], they will spend their days in happiness, and their years in pleasures.
018	JOB	036	012	But if they hearken not, they will pass away through the sword, and they will perish in want of knowledge.
018	JOB	036	013	But the hypocrites in heart persevere in wrath; they will not offer entreaty when he bindeth them:
018	JOB	036	014	Their soul will die in youth, and their life, among the incestuous.
018	JOB	036	015	He delivereth the afflicted through his affliction, and openeth through oppression his ear.
018	JOB	036	016	And also thee hath he incited away from the jaws of distress into a wide space, on the site of which there is no straitness; and what is set on thy table is full of fatness.
018	JOB	036	017	But if thou art full of the judgment of the wicked: [divine] judgment and decree will support each other.
018	JOB	036	018	For there would be fury, If aught were to incite thee to utter an abundance [of rebellious words]; and the greatness of the infliction must not mislead thee.
018	JOB	036	019	Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold ore, nor all the highest forces of strength.
018	JOB	036	020	Desire then not eagerly the night, when nations pass away in their place.
018	JOB	036	021	Take heed, turn not thyself to wrong-doing, so that thou wouldst choose this because of [thy] affliction.
018	JOB	036	022	Behold, God is exalted by his power: who is an instructer like him?
018	JOB	036	023	Who hath given him a charge concerning his way? or who hath ever said, Thou hast acted unjustly?
018	JOB	036	024	Reflect, that thou shouldst magnify his work, which [other] men have beheld.
018	JOB	036	025	All men have looked at it [with astonishment]; the mortal gazeth at it from afar.
018	JOB	036	026	Behold, God is great, and we comprehend him not, the number of his years can truly not be searched out.
018	JOB	036	027	For he taketh away drops of water, which are purified into rain in his mist:
018	JOB	036	028	These drop down out of the skies; they distil upon the multitude of men.
018	JOB	036	029	But [what man] can understand the outspreadings of the clouds? the tumult of his tabernacle?
018	JOB	036	030	Behold, he spreadeth out over it his light, and covereth up the roots of the sea.
018	JOB	036	031	For by means of them he judgeth nations, he giveth food in superfluity.
018	JOB	036	032	[His] hands he covereth with light; and he commandeth it to strike the one who striveth against him.
018	JOB	036	033	The noise of his storm telleth of it, yea, the cattle also, of the rising tempest.
018	JOB	037	001	At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved upward out of its place.
018	JOB	037	002	Hear, O hear, the rattling of his thunder, and the storm's roar that goeth out of his mouth.
018	JOB	037	003	Under the whole heavens he letteth it loose, and his lightning over the ends of the earth.
018	JOB	037	004	Behind it roareth the thunder; he thundereth with his majestic voice; and he holdeth them not back when his voice is heard.
018	JOB	037	005	God thundereth with his marvelous voice: he doth great things, which we cannot comprehend.
018	JOB	037	006	For to the snow he saith, Be thou on the earth: likewise the pouring rain, and to the pouring rains of his strength.
018	JOB	037	007	He sealeth it on the hand of every man, that all men whom he hath made may know it.
018	JOB	037	008	Then retire the beasts into [their] dens, and rest in their lairs.
018	JOB	037	009	Out of [his] chamber cometh the whirlwind, and out of the north, the cold.
018	JOB	037	010	From the breathing of God ice is given, and the broad waters become solid.
018	JOB	037	011	Also with moisture he loadeth the cloud; [and] he scattereth the cloud of his lightning;
018	JOB	037	012	And it is turned round about by his guidance, to execute what he commandeth it upon the face of the world, the earth.
018	JOB	037	013	Whether it be as a chastising rod—if this be destined for his earth—or for kindness, doth he cause it to come.
018	JOB	037	014	Give ear unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider well the wonders of God.
018	JOB	037	015	Dost thou know how God hath imposed [a law] on them, and [how] he hath caused the light of his cloud to shine?
018	JOB	037	016	Dost thou know aught about the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge?
018	JOB	037	017	[Thou] who clothest thyself with warm garments, when He giveth the earth rest from the south wind?
018	JOB	037	018	Hast thou with him spread out the skies, which are strong even as a molten mirror?
018	JOB	037	019	Let us know what we shall say unto him: we cannot set aught in order [before him] because of darkness.
018	JOB	037	020	Can [all] be related of him, when I speak [ever so much]? or if a man talk [of him] even till he be swallowed up [in death]?
018	JOB	037	021	Yet now men see not the light which is bright in the skies, when the wind hath passed along, and purified them.
018	JOB	037	022	The golden [light] that cometh out of the north: around God is terrible majesty.
018	JOB	037	023	The Almighty, whom we cannot find out, excellent in power, and in justice, and abounding in righteousness, will not afflict:
018	JOB	037	024	Therefore do men fear him; he respecteth not any that are wise of heart.
018	JOB	038	001	Then did the Lord address Job out of the storm-wind, and said,
018	JOB	038	002	Who is this that casteth darkness [on my] counsel by words without knowledge?
018	JOB	038	003	Do but gird up like a mighty man thy loins: and I will ask thee, and do thou inform me.
018	JOB	038	004	Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? tell it, if thou hast any understanding [of it].
018	JOB	038	005	Who fixed her measurements, if thou knowest it? or who stretched the measuring-line over her?
018	JOB	038	006	Upon what are her foundation-pillars placed at rest? or who laid her corner-stone:
018	JOB	038	007	When altogether sang the morning stars in gladness, and shouted for joy all the sons of God?
018	JOB	038	008	And who closed up with doors the sea, when, issuing forth, it came out of the deep bosom of the earth?
018	JOB	038	009	When I made the clouds its garment, and thick fog its swaddling-cloth,
018	JOB	038	010	And when I decreed for it my law, and set [for it] bars and doors,
018	JOB	038	011	And said, Thus far mayest thou come, but no farther; and here shall be stayed [thy strength] in the pride of thy waves?
018	JOB	038	012	Didst thou ever, in all thy days, command the morning; didst thou ever assign the morning-dawn its place:
018	JOB	038	013	That it might lay hold of the ends of the earth, so that the wicked might be shaken out therefrom?
018	JOB	038	014	She is changed as the sealing-clay: and [all things] stand as though newly clad.
018	JOB	038	015	And from the wicked is their light withdrawn, and the high-raised arm is broken.
018	JOB	038	016	Didst thou ever penetrate as far as the springs of the sea? or wander through the bottom of the deep?
018	JOB	038	017	Were the gates of death ever laid open unto thee? or canst thou see the doors of the shadow of death?
018	JOB	038	018	Hast thou a clear understanding of the breadth of the earth? Tell it, if thou knowest it all.
018	JOB	038	019	Where is the way [to the spot where] the light dwelleth? and the darkness—where is its place,
018	JOB	038	020	That thou mightest take each to its boundary, and that thou mightest mark the pathways to its house?
018	JOB	038	021	Thou [surely] knowest it; because thou wast then born, and the number of thy days is great!
018	JOB	038	022	Didst thou ever enter into the treasuries of the snow? or canst thou see the treasuries of the hail,
018	JOB	038	023	Which I have reserved for the time of distress, for the day of fight and battle?
018	JOB	038	024	Where is the way [to the spot where] the light divideth itself, [where] the east wind is scattered over the earth?
018	JOB	038	025	Who hath divided off watercourses for the overflowing rain, and a way for the lightning [that is followed by] thunders,
018	JOB	038	026	To bring rain on a land, void of men; on a wilderness wherein no son of earth [is found];
018	JOB	038	027	To satisfy waste and desolate lands; and to promote the growth of the tender grass?
018	JOB	038	028	Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of the dew?
018	JOB	038	029	Out of whose womb cometh forth the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven—who giveth birth to it?
018	JOB	038	030	[When] like a stone the waters are congealed, and the face of the deep is bound in fetters?
018	JOB	038	031	Canst thou bind together the chains of the Pleiades, or loosen the bands of Orion?
018	JOB	038	032	Canst thou bring forth the constellations of the zodiac, each in its season? or canst thou guide the Bear with its young?
018	JOB	038	033	Knowest thou the laws of heaven? or dost thou appoint its rule on the earth?
018	JOB	038	034	Canst thou lift up to the clouds thy voice, that the abundance of waters may cover thee?
018	JOB	038	035	Canst thou send out lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here are we?
018	JOB	038	036	Who hath put wisdom in the dark clouds? or who hath given understanding to the bright meteors?
018	JOB	038	037	Who ordaineth the skies with wisdom? or who emptieth out the bottles of heaven.
018	JOB	038	038	When the dust is poured out as molten metal, and the clods are made to cleave fast together?
018	JOB	038	039	Dost thou hunt for the lioness her prey? and suppliest thou the food for the young lions,
018	JOB	038	040	When they are couched in their lairs, rest in the thicket, lying in wait?
018	JOB	038	041	Who provideth for the raven his provision? when his young ones cry unto God, and wander about for lack of food?
018	JOB	039	001	Knowest thou the time when the chamois of the rock bring forth? or markest thou when the hinds do calve?
018	JOB	039	002	Numberest thou the months of gestation which they complete and knowest thou the time when they bring forth?
018	JOB	039	003	They bend themselves: they drop their young ones; throw off their pains.
018	JOB	039	004	Their little ones become strong; they grow up in the open field; they go forth, and return not unto them.
018	JOB	039	005	Who sent out the wild ass free? or who loosened the bonds of the forest-ass?
018	JOB	039	006	To whom I assigned the wilderness as his house, and the salty land as his dwellings.
018	JOB	039	007	He laugheth at the noise of a town, and the shoutings of the driver he heareth not.
018	JOB	039	008	What he espieth on the mountains is his pasture, and after every green thing doth he search.
018	JOB	039	009	Will the forest-ox be willing to serve thee, or will he stay over night at thy crib?
018	JOB	039	010	Canst thou bind the forest-ox with a rope [to labor] in the furrow? or will he harrow valleys, following after thee?
018	JOB	039	011	Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? and wilt thou leave to him thy labor?
018	JOB	039	012	Wilt thou confide in him, that he should bring home thy seed, and gather it into thy threshing-floor?—
018	JOB	039	013	The wing of the ostrich moveth joyfully: hath she the pinions and plumage of the careful stork?
018	JOB	039	014	[No,] for she intrusteth her eggs to the earth, and letteth them be hatched out on the dust:
018	JOB	039	015	And she forgetteth that a foot may crush them, or that the beast of the field may stamp them down.
018	JOB	039	016	He hath made her callous against her young, as though they were not hers: her labor is in vain, [but she feeleth] no dread;
018	JOB	039	017	Because God hath denied her wisdom, and he hath not imparted to her understanding.
018	JOB	039	018	At the time she raiseth herself up on high, she laugheth at the horse and his rider.
018	JOB	039	019	Dost thou give the horse strength? dost thou clothe his neck with the rolling mane?
018	JOB	039	020	Canst thou make him jump like a locust? his majestic snort is terrible.
018	JOB	039	021	Men spy about in the valley, and he rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth forth to meet the armed array.
018	JOB	039	022	He laugheth at fear, and is not dismayed; and turneth not back from before the sword.
018	JOB	039	023	Over him rattle the quiver, the glittering spear and the lance.
018	JOB	039	024	With impatient noise and rage he holloweth [with his hoof] the ground, and keepeth not quiet when the cornet's voice [is heard].
018	JOB	039	025	Midst the sound of the cornet he uttereth his joyful neigh; and from afar he perceiveth the battle, the loud call of the captains, and the battle-cry.—
018	JOB	039	026	Is it through thy understanding that the hawk flieth along, and spreadeth out his wings toward the south?
018	JOB	039	027	Or is it by your order that the eagle doth mount upward, and buildeth high up his nest?
018	JOB	039	028	On a rock he dwelleth, and spendeth his nights, on a rocky crag and mountain fastness.
018	JOB	039	029	From there he espieth his food, from afar can his eyes behold.
018	JOB	039	030	His young ones, also, sip up blood: and where the slain be, there is he.
018	JOB	040	001	And the Lord addressed Job, and said,
018	JOB	040	002	Will he that contendeth with the Almighty yet find fault? him that reproveth God answer this.
018	JOB	040	003	Then answered Job the Lord, and said,
018	JOB	040	004	Behold, I am too vile: what shall I answer thee? my hand do I place on my mouth.
018	JOB	040	005	Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will not repeat it again.
018	JOB	040	006	Then answered the Lord unto Job out of the storm-wind, and said,
018	JOB	040	007	Do but gird up like a mighty man thy loins: I will ask thee, and do thou inform me.
018	JOB	040	008	Wilt thou indeed annul my decree? wilt thou condemn me, in order that thou mayest appear righteous?
018	JOB	040	009	But if thou hast an arm like God, or if thou canst thunder loudly like him:
018	JOB	040	010	Then do deck thyself with excellence and greatness, and clothe thyself in majesty and glory.
018	JOB	040	011	Scatter abroad the ragings of thy wrath, and look on every proud one, and humble him.
018	JOB	040	012	Look on every proud one, and bend him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.
018	JOB	040	013	Hide them in the dust altogether: bind up their faces in concealment.
018	JOB	040	014	Then will I also myself praise thee, when thy own right hand hath helped thee.
018	JOB	040	015	Only behold Behemoth, which I made near thee: grass he eateth like the ox.
018	JOB	040	016	Only see, [how great] is his strength in his loins, and his force, in the muscles of his belly.
018	JOB	040	017	He stretcheth out his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his loins are closely wrapped together.
018	JOB	040	018	His bones are like pipes of brass: his frame is like bars of iron.
018	JOB	040	019	He is the first in rank of the works of God: he that made him can alone bring his sword near unto him.
018	JOB	040	020	But truly the mountains bear for him his food, and all the beasts of the field play there.
018	JOB	040	021	Under shady trees he lieth down, in the covert of the reeds, and swamp.
018	JOB	040	022	Shady trees cover him as his shadow: willows of the brook encompass him about.
018	JOB	040	023	Behold, a river sweepeth violently along, but he hasteneth not away: he remaineth quiet, though a Jordan rusheth up to his mouth.
018	JOB	040	024	Can one catch him before his eyes? pierce his nose by means of snares?—
018	JOB	041	001	Canst thou draw out the crocodile with a fishhook? or cause his tongue to sink into the batted rope?
018	JOB	041	002	Canst thou put a reed through his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?
018	JOB	041	003	Will he address many supplications unto thee? or will he speak submissively unto thee?
018	JOB	041	004	Will he make a covenant with thee? that thou couldst take him as a servant for ever?
018	JOB	041	005	Canst thou play with him as with a bird? and tie him up for thy maidens?
018	JOB	041	006	Can companions waylay him? can they divide him among merchants?
018	JOB	041	007	Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? and [pierce] with a fish-spear his head?
018	JOB	041	008	Lay thy hand upon him; think of the battle: thou wilt never do it again.
018	JOB	041	009	Behold, his expectation was deceived: even at his mere sight is he cast down.
018	JOB	041	010	None is so daring that he would stir him up: and who is there that will stand up before me?
018	JOB	041	011	Who hath shown me favor, that I should repay him! whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.—
018	JOB	041	012	I will not conceal [the account of] his limbs, nor the relation of his might, nor the grace of his proportion.
018	JOB	041	013	Who hath ever laid open the front of his garment? or who can penetrate into his double row of teeth?
018	JOB	041	014	Who hath opened the doors of his face? all round about his teeth abideth terror.
018	JOB	041	015	What pride is there in [his] strong shields; he is locked up as with a close seal.
018	JOB	041	016	One is joined to another; and no breath can come between them.
018	JOB	041	017	They are fitted closely one to another: they are interlocked, that they cannot be severed.
018	JOB	041	018	From his sneezing there beameth forth a light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning-dawn.
018	JOB	041	019	Out of his mouth issue burning torches, sparks of fire escape [therefrom].
018	JOB	041	020	Out of his nostrils cometh forth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.
018	JOB	041	021	His breath kindleth coals, and a flame cometh out of his mouth.
018	JOB	041	022	In his neck abideth strength, and before him danceth terror joyfully.
018	JOB	041	023	The flakes of his flesh are fitted closely together: they are as molten metal on him, immovable.
018	JOB	041	024	His heart is firm like a stone: yea, as firm as the nether millstone.
018	JOB	041	025	At his lifting himself up the mighty are terrified: the waves also are lessened.
018	JOB	041	026	If one overtake him with the sword, it cannot hold; nor the spear, the dart, and armor.
018	JOB	041	027	He esteemeth iron as straw, [and] brass as rotten wood.
018	JOB	041	028	The child of the bow cannot make him flee: into stubble are slingstones changed unto him.
018	JOB	041	029	Clubs are esteemed as stubble, and he laugheth at the whirring of the lance.
018	JOB	041	030	Beneath him are sharp-pointed potsherds, he spreadeth out, [as it were, a] threshing-roller upon the mire.
018	JOB	041	031	He causeth the deep to boil like a pot: he rendereth the sea like an apothecary's mixture.
018	JOB	041	032	Behind him he causeth his pathway to shine, [so that] men esteem the deep to be hoary.
018	JOB	041	033	There is none upon earth that ruleth over him, who is made to be without dread.
018	JOB	041	034	He looketh upon all that is high: he is the king over all the ravenous beasts.
018	JOB	042	001	Then answered Job unto the Lord, and said,
018	JOB	042	002	I acknowledge that thou art able to do every thing, and that no deep plan of thine can be restrained.
018	JOB	042	003	Who is he that dareth to conceal [thy] counsel without knowledge? Truly I have spoken of what I understood not, of things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.
018	JOB	042	004	Oh do but hear [me], and I will indeed speak: I will ask of thee, and do thou inform me.
018	JOB	042	005	I had only heard of thee by the hearing of the ear; but now my eye hath seen thee.
018	JOB	042	006	Therefore I reject [what I have said], and repent; because I am dust and ashes.
018	JOB	042	007	And it came to pass, after the Lord had spoken these words unto Job, that the Lord said to Eliphaz the Themanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends; because ye have not spoken of me properly, like my servant Job.
018	JOB	042	008	And now take unto yourselves seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up a burnt-offering in your behalf; and my servant Job shall pray for you; for him alone will I receive favorably, so as not to deal with you after your folly; because ye have not spoken of me properly, like my servant Job.
018	JOB	042	009	Then went Eliphaz the Themanite and Bildad the Shuchite and Zophar the Na'amathite, and did in accordance with what the Lord had spoken to them: and the Lord received Job in favor.
018	JOB	042	010	And the Lord brought back the captivity of Job, when he prayed in behalf of his friends; and the Lord increased all that Job had had twofold.
018	JOB	042	011	And then came unto him all his brothers, and all his sisters, and all that had been of his acquaintance before, and ate bread with him in his house; and they condoled with him, and comforted him for all the evil that the Lord had brought upon him; and they gave him, every one, a kessitah, and every one an earring of gold.
018	JOB	042	012	And the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: and he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-asses.
018	JOB	042	013	He had also seven sons and three daughters.
018	JOB	042	014	And he called the name of the first Jemimah; and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch.
018	JOB	042	015	And there were not found such handsome women as the daughters of Job in all the land; and their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers.
018	JOB	042	016	And Job lived after this one hundred and forty years: and he saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.
018	JOB	042	017	Then died Job, being old and full of days.

# BOOK	019	PSA	Psalms	Psalms
019	PSA	001	001	BOOK FIRST: Happy is the man who walketh not in the council of the wicked, and standeth not in the way of sinners, and sitteth not in the seat of scorners;
019	PSA	001	002	But whose delight is in the law of the Lord, and who doth meditate in his law by day and night.
019	PSA	001	003	And he shall be like a tree planted by rivulets of water, that yieldeth its fruit in its season, and the leaf of which doth not wither; and all that he may do shall prosper.
019	PSA	001	004	Not so the wicked; but they are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.
019	PSA	001	005	Therefore shall the wicked not be able to stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
019	PSA	001	006	For the Lord regardeth the way of the righteous; but the way of the wicked leadeth to perdition.
019	PSA	002	001	Wherefore do nations rage, and people meditate a vain thing?
019	PSA	002	002	The kings of the earth raise themselves up, and rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his anointed:
019	PSA	002	003	“Let us break asunder their bands, and cast away from us their cords.”
019	PSA	002	004	He who dwelleth in the heavens will laugh: the Lord will hold them in derision.
019	PSA	002	005	Then will he speak unto them in his anger, and in his displeasure will he terrify them.
019	PSA	002	006	[Saying,] Yet have I appointed my king upon Zion my holy mount.
019	PSA	002	007	I will announce the decree, the Lord hath said unto me, “My son art thou: I have indeed this day begotten thee.
019	PSA	002	008	Ask it of me, and I will give thee nations for an inheritance, and for thy possession the uttermost ends of the earth.
019	PSA	002	009	Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; like a potter's vessel shalt thou dash them in pieces.”
019	PSA	002	010	And now, O ye kings, be wise: take warning, ye judges of the earth.
019	PSA	002	011	Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
019	PSA	002	012	Do homage to the son, lest he be angry, and ye be lost on the way; for his wrath is so speedily kindled. Happy are all they that put their trust in him.
019	PSA	003	001	“A psalm of David, when he fled from before Abshalom his son.” Lord, how numerous are my assailants! how many, that rise up against me!
019	PSA	003	002	Many say of my soul, There is no help for him with God. (Selah)
019	PSA	003	003	But thou, O Lord, art a shield around me, my glory, and he that lifteth up my head.
019	PSA	003	004	With my voice I call unto the Lord, and he answereth me out of his holy mountain. (Selah)
019	PSA	003	005	I laid myself down and slept: I awoke; for the Lord sustaineth me.
019	PSA	003	006	I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have placed themselves round about against me.
019	PSA	003	007	Arise, O Lord, help me, O my God; for thou smitest all my enemies upon the cheek bone: the teeth of the wicked dost thou break.
019	PSA	003	008	Salvation belongeth unto the Lord: thy blessing be upon thy people. (Selah)
019	PSA	004	001	“To the chief musician on Neginoth, a psalm of David.” When I call, answer me, O God of my righteousness: amidst distress thou hast [ever] granted me enlargement; be gracious unto me, and hear my prayer.
019	PSA	004	002	O ye sons of men, how long shall my glory be put to shame? [how long] will ye love vanity, will ye seek for lies? (Selah)
019	PSA	004	003	But know that the Lord hath set apart the pious for himself: the Lord will hear when I call on him.
019	PSA	004	004	Tremble, and sin not: commune with your heart upon your bed, and be still (Selah)
019	PSA	004	005	Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the Lord.
019	PSA	004	006	Many say, “Who will show us happiness? Let shine brightly over us the light of thy countenance, O Lord.”
019	PSA	004	007	[But] thou hast placed more joy in my heart than at the time when their corn and their wine were increased.
019	PSA	004	008	In peace, altogether, will I lay me down and sleep; for thou, Lord, alone, causest me to dwell in safety.
019	PSA	005	001	“To the chief musician upon Nechiloth, a psalm of David.” To my words give ear, O Lord, have regard to my mediation.
019	PSA	005	002	Listen unto the voice of my loud cry, my King, and my God, when unto thee I pray.
019	PSA	005	003	O Lord! in the morning do thou hear my voice: in the morning will I set in order [my prayer] before thee, and 1ook up with hope.
019	PSA	005	004	For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: evil cannot abide with thee.
019	PSA	005	005	The arrogant cannot stand up before thy eyes: thou hatest all workers of wickedness.
019	PSA	005	006	Thou wilt destroy those that speak lies: the man of blood and deceit the Lord abhorreth.
019	PSA	005	007	But as for me—in the abundance of thy kindness will I enter thy house: I will bow myself down before thy holy temple in the fear of thee.
019	PSA	005	008	O Lord, lead me in thy righteousness because of those that regard me enviously; make straight before me thy way.
019	PSA	005	009	For there is not in their mouth any sincerity; their inward part is full of deception; an open sepulchre is their throat: they flatter with their tongue.
019	PSA	005	010	Condemn them, O God: let them fall through their own counsels; for the multitude of their transgressions cast them down; for they have rebelled against thee.
019	PSA	005	011	Then will rejoice all those that put their trust in thee; for ever will they shout for joy, when thou protectest them: and then will exult in thee those that love thy name.
019	PSA	005	012	For thou wilt bless the righteous, O Lord; as with a shield wilt thou encompass him with favor.
019	PSA	006	001	“To the chief musician on Neginoth upon Sheminith, a psalm of David.” O Lord, correct me not in thy anger, and chastise me not in thy wrath.
019	PSA	006	002	Be gracious unto me, O Lord; for I am withering away; heal me, O Lord; for my bones are terrified.
019	PSA	006	003	And my soul is greatly terrified; but thou, O Lord, how long yet—?
019	PSA	006	004	Return, O Lord, deliver my soul: help me for the sake of thy kindness.
019	PSA	006	005	For in death men do not remember thee: in the nether world, who shall give thee thanks?
019	PSA	006	006	I am weary with my sighing; I flood every night my bed; With my tears I moisten my couch.
019	PSA	006	007	My eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all my assailants.
019	PSA	006	008	Depart from me, all ye workers of wickedness; for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping.
019	PSA	006	009	The Lord hath heard my supplication; the Lord will accept my prayer.
019	PSA	006	010	Ashamed and greatly terrified shall become all my enemies; they will turn round, and be made ashamed in a moment.
019	PSA	007	001	“A Shiggayon of David, which he sang unto the Lord, concerning the affairs of Cush the Benjamite.” O Lord my God, in thee do I put my trust; save me from every one of my persecutors, and deliver me:
019	PSA	007	002	Lest he tear like a lion my soul, rending it in pieces, with none to deliver.
019	PSA	007	003	O Lord my God, if I have done this; if there be injustice in my hands;
019	PSA	007	004	If I have recompensed him that was at peace with me with evil; If I have taken aught from my assailants without cause:
019	PSA	007	005	May the enemy hotly pursue my soul, and overtake it; and tread down upon the earth my life, and cause my honor to be in the dust. (Selah)
019	PSA	007	006	Arise, O Lord, in thy anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of my enemies: and awake for me [to] the judgment that thou hast commanded.
019	PSA	007	007	So shall the congregation of nations compass thee about: and for their sakes return thou to the height.
019	PSA	007	008	The Lord will judge the people: judge me, O Lord, according to my righteousness, and according to my integrity [grant] me [recompense].
019	PSA	007	009	Oh let the evil of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just, O thou, who triest the hearts and reins, O righteous God.
019	PSA	007	010	My protection is by God, who saveth the upright in heath.
019	PSA	007	011	God is a righteous judge, and a God who is indignant [with the wicked] every day.
019	PSA	007	012	If he turn not, He will whet his sword, he bendeth his bow, and maketh it ready.
019	PSA	007	013	Also for him he prepareth the instruments of death; he fashioneth his arrows against the persecutors.
019	PSA	007	014	Behold, he travaileth with wrong doing; but he hath conceived mischief, and bringeth forth falsehood.
019	PSA	007	015	He hath hollowed out a pit, and dug it, and is fallen into the ditch which he hath wrought.
019	PSA	007	016	His mischief will return upon his own head, and upon his own skull will his violence come down.
019	PSA	007	017	I will thank the Lord according to his righteousness; and I will sing praises to the name of the Lord the Most High.
019	PSA	008	001	“To the chief musician upon Gittith, a psalm of David.” O Eternal One our Lord, how excellent is thy name on all the earth! thou who hast set thy majesty above the heavens.
019	PSA	008	002	Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou founded [thy] might, because of thy opponents, that thou mightest bring to silence the enemy and him that seeketh vengeance.
019	PSA	008	003	When I behold thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast established: —
019	PSA	008	004	What is the mortal, that thou rememberest him? and the son of man, that thou thinkest of him:
019	PSA	008	005	Yet thou hast made him but a little less than angels, and hast crowned him with honor and glory.
019	PSA	008	006	Thou hast given him dominion over the works of thy hands; every thing hast thou placed beneath his feet:
019	PSA	008	007	Flocks and herds altogether, and also the beasts of the field;
019	PSA	008	008	The birds of heaven, and the fishes of the sea, whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.
019	PSA	008	009	O Eternal One our Lord, how excellent is thy name on all the earth!
019	PSA	009	001	“To the chief musician upon Muthlabben, a psalm of David.” I will thank the Lord with all my heart: I will relate all thy marvelous deeds.
019	PSA	009	002	I will rejoice and exult in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou Most High:
019	PSA	009	003	When my enemies are turned backward, [when] they fall and perish at thy presence.
019	PSA	009	004	For thou hast conducted my dispute and my cause; thou hast sat on the throne as a righteous judge.
019	PSA	009	005	Thou hast rebuked nations, thou hast caused the wicked to perish, their name hast thou blotted out for ever and ever.
019	PSA	009	006	O thou enemy, the ruins are passed away for ever, and the cities which thou hast destroyed, —lost is their memorial, yea, theirs.
019	PSA	009	007	But the Lord will sit enthroned for ever: he hath established for giving judgment his throne.
019	PSA	009	008	And he will judge the world with righteousness, he shall decide for the people, with equity.
019	PSA	009	009	The Lord also will be a strong-hold for the oppressed, a strong-hold in times of distress.
019	PSA	009	010	And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee; for thou hast not forsaken those that seek thee, O Lord.
019	PSA	009	011	Sing praises to the Lord, who dwelleth in Zion: announce among the people his deeds.
019	PSA	009	012	For he, that inquireth after acts of blood, hath remembered them: he hath not forgotten the cry of the afflicted.
019	PSA	009	013	Be gracious unto me, O Lord; have regard to my affliction [coming] from those that hate me, thou who liftest me up from the gates of death:
019	PSA	009	014	In order that I may relate all thy praises in the gates of the daughters of Zion: I will be glad in thy salvation.
019	PSA	009	015	Sunk are nations in the ditch that they have prepared: in this net which they had laid in secret is their own foot caught.
019	PSA	009	016	The Lord is made known: he executed justice: through the doing of his own hands is the wicked ensnared. Higgayon, (Selah)
019	PSA	009	017	The wicked shall return into hell, all the nations that are forgetful of God.
019	PSA	009	018	For not everlastingly shall the needy be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever.
019	PSA	009	019	Arise, O Lord; let not the mortal boast of his strength; let nations be judged before thy face.
019	PSA	009	020	Place, O Lord, fear over them: let nations know, that they are but mortals. (Selah)
019	PSA	010	001	Wherefore, O Lord, standest thou afar off? hidest thyself in times of distress?
019	PSA	010	002	In the pride of the wicked doth he hotly pursue the poor: they are seized through the plans that those have devised.
019	PSA	010	003	For the wicked boasteth of the longing of his soul, and the robber blesseth himself when he hath despised the Lord.
019	PSA	010	004	The wicked, according to the pride of his wrathfulness, [saith,] He will not require, There is no God [in] all his plans.
019	PSA	010	005	Prosperous are his ways at all times; far in the height [remain] thy punishments away from him: all his assailants—he puffeth at them.
019	PSA	010	006	He saith in his heart, I shall not be moved; I shall be for many generations, and without adversity.
019	PSA	010	007	Of the false oaths is his mouth full, and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and wickedness.
019	PSA	010	008	He sitteth in the lurking-places of the villages; in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes search for the unfortunate.
019	PSA	010	009	He lieth in wait in a secret place like a lion in his den; he lieth in wait to snatch up the poor: he snatcheth up the poor, as they draweth him into his net.
019	PSA	010	010	He croucheth, he bendeth himself, and the unfortunate fall through his might.
019	PSA	010	011	He saith in his heart, God hath forgotten; he hath hidden his face; he will never see it.
019	PSA	010	012	Arise, O Lord; O God, lift up thy hand: forget not the afflicted.
019	PSA	010	013	For what doth the wicked despise God? [why] doth he say in his heart, Thou wilt not require it?
019	PSA	010	014	Thou hast seen it: for thou beholdest mischief and despiteful acts, to requite it with thy hand: unto thee the unfortunate committeth himself; unto the fatherless hast thou [ever] been a helper.
019	PSA	010	015	Break thou the arm of the wicked; and of the bad man—thou wilt inquire for his wickedness [till] thou find none.
019	PSA	010	016	The Lord is King for ever and ever: nations are perished out of his land.
019	PSA	010	017	The longing of the afflicted dost thou hear, O Lord! thou wilt strengthen their heart, thou wilt cause thy ear to listen:
019	PSA	010	018	To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that not farther more shall be arrogant the mortal from the earth.
019	PSA	011	001	“To the chief musician, by David.” In the Lord have I put my trust: how can ye say to my soul, Flee to your mountain as a bird?
019	PSA	011	002	For lo, the wicked bend their bow, they arrange their arrow upon the string, to shoot in the dark at the upright in heart.
019	PSA	011	003	For [if] the foundations be torn down, what can the righteous do?
019	PSA	011	004	The Lord is in his holy temple, the Lord hath his throne in the heavens, his eyes behold, his eyelids prove, the children of men.
019	PSA	011	005	The Lord proveth the righteous; but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.
019	PSA	011	006	He letteth rain upon the wicked burning coals, fire and brimstone; and a glowing wind is the portion of their cup.
019	PSA	011	007	For righteous is the Lord, he loveth righteousness: his countenance doth behold the upright.
019	PSA	012	001	“To the chief musician upon Sheminith, a psalm of David.” Help, O Lord; for the pious have ceased to be; for the truthful have failed from among the children of men.
019	PSA	012	002	Deceptively do they speak every one with his neighbor, with flattering lips, with a double heart do they speak.
019	PSA	012	003	May the Lord cut off all flattering lips, the tongue that speaketh boastful things:
019	PSA	012	004	Who have said, With our tongue will we be mighty; our lips are with us; who is Lord over us!
019	PSA	012	005	Because of the oppression of the poor, because of the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the Lord: I will grant safety to him for whom the other layeth a snare.
019	PSA	012	006	The words of the Lord are pure words, as silver refined in the crucible of earth, purified seven times.
019	PSA	012	007	Thou, O Lord, wilt preserve them; thou wilt guard them from this generation for ever.
019	PSA	012	008	On every side do the wicked walk about, when the vile are exalted over the sons of man.
019	PSA	013	001	“To the chief musician, a psalm of David.” How long, O Lord, wilt thou forget me continually! how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?
019	PSA	013	002	How long shall I have to devise resolves in my soul, with grief in my heart daily? how long shall my enemy exalt himself over me?
019	PSA	013	003	Look down, answer me, O Lord my God! enlighten my eyes, that I may not sleep the sleep of death;
019	PSA	013	004	That my enemy may not say, I have overcome him; that my assailants may not be glad when I am moved.
019	PSA	013	005	But I trust in thy kindness, let my heart be glad because of thy salvation:
019	PSA	013	006	I will sing unto the Lord, because he hath dealt bountifully with me.
019	PSA	014	001	“To the chief musician, by David.” The worthless fool saith in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they are abominable [in their] doings, there is none that doth good.
019	PSA	014	002	The Lord looketh down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there be one intelligent, one who seeketh for God.
019	PSA	014	003	They are all gone aside, they are altogether become corrupt: there is none that doth good, no, not even one.
019	PSA	014	004	Is there no knowledge in all the workers of wickedness? who eat up my people as they eat bread; [while] they do not call on the Lord.
019	PSA	014	005	There are they terrified in terror; for God is with the righteous generation:
019	PSA	014	006	The counsel of the poor [though] you put to shame; because the Lord is his protection.
019	PSA	014	007	Oh that some one might bring the salvation of Israel out of Zion! When the Lord bringeth back the captivity of his people, then will Jacob be glad, and Israel will rejoice.
019	PSA	015	001	“A psalm of David.” Lord, who may sojourn in thy tent? who may dwell on thy holy mount?
019	PSA	015	002	He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart;
019	PSA	015	003	That uttereth no calumny with his tongue, that doth no evil to his neighbor, and bringeth no reproach on his fellow-man;
019	PSA	015	004	In whose eyes the despicable is despised; but that honoreth those who fear the Lord; that sweareth to his own injury, and changeth not;
019	PSA	015	005	That putteth not out his money for interest, and taketh no bribe against the innocent. He that doth these things shall not be moved to eternity.
019	PSA	016	001	“A Michtham of David.” Preserve me, O God; for I have placed my trust in thee.
019	PSA	016	002	[O my soul], thou hast said unto the Lord, Thou art my Lord: my happiness is not without thee;
019	PSA	016	003	[But] in the saints who are on the earth, and in the excellent—in them is all my delight.
019	PSA	016	004	Multiplied shall be the sorrows of those who give presents to another god: I will not pour out their drink-offerings of blood, nor bear their names upon my lips.
019	PSA	016	005	Thou, O Lord, art the portion of my inheritance, and my cup; thou hast drawn my lot.
019	PSA	016	006	My possessions are fallen in agreeable places: yea, my heritage is pleasant to me.
019	PSA	016	007	I will bless the Lord, who hath given me counsel: also in the night seasons my reins admonish me.
019	PSA	016	008	I have always set the Lord before me, that, being at my right hand, I might not be moved.
019	PSA	016	009	Therefore is rejoiced my heart, and my spirit is glad: also my flesh shall rest in safety.
019	PSA	016	010	For thou wilt not abandon my soul to the grave: thou wilt not suffer thy pious [servant] to see corruption.
019	PSA	016	011	Thou wilt let me know the path of life: fulness of joy is in thy presence; pleasures are at thy right hand for evermore.
019	PSA	017	001	“A prayer of David.” Hear, O Lord, [the cause of] righteousness, attend unto my entreaty, give ear unto my prayer, coming from lips without deceit.
019	PSA	017	002	Let from thy presence my sentence come forth; let thy eyes behold what is right.
019	PSA	017	003	Thou hast proved my heart; thou hast thought of me in the night; thou hast refined me—thou couldst find nothing: my purpose doth not pass beyond [the words of] my mouth.
019	PSA	017	004	Among the deeds of men did I observe, by the word of thy lips, the paths of the dissolute.
019	PSA	017	005	My steps held firmly to thy tracks, [and] my footsteps did not slip.
019	PSA	017	006	I call on thee, for thou wilt answer me, O God: incline thy ear unto me, hear my speech.
019	PSA	017	007	Show marvelously thy loving-kindnesses, O thou that savest those who put their trust [in thee] from those that rise up [against them] by thy right hand.
019	PSA	017	008	Keep me as the apple of the eye; conceal me under the shadow of thy wings,
019	PSA	017	009	From the wicked that despoil me, my enemies, who, to take my life, compass me about.
019	PSA	017	010	They are enclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly.
019	PSA	017	011	On our steps they now encompass us: they direct their eyes to turn aside in the land.
019	PSA	017	012	Every man is just like a lion that is greedy to tear his prey, and like a young lion lurking in a covert.
019	PSA	017	013	Arise, O Lord, prevent him, cast him down; deliver my soul from the wicked, who is thy sword, —
019	PSA	017	014	From these men—thy hand—O Lord, from the men of this world, whose portion is in this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hidden treasure: they have children in plenty, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes.
019	PSA	017	015	As for me, in righteousness shall I behold thy face: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with contemplating thy likeness.
019	PSA	018	001	“To the chief musician, by the servant of the Lord, by David, who spoke unto the Lord the words of this song on the day that the Lord had delivered him out of the power of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul; And he said,” I ever love thee, O Lord, my strength.
019	PSA	018	002	The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my rock, in whom I trust; my shield, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.
019	PSA	018	003	Praised, I cried, be the Lord, and from my enemies was I saved.
019	PSA	018	004	The bonds of death encompassed me, and the floods of destruction made me afraid.
019	PSA	018	005	The bonds of hell encircled me: the snares of death seized on me.
019	PSA	018	006	[When] in my distress I called upon the Lord, and unto my God I cried: he heard from his temple my voice, and my complaint came before him, even into his ears.
019	PSA	018	007	Then shook and trembled the earth; and the foundations of the mountains were moved; and they were shaken, because he was wroth.
019	PSA	018	008	Smoke went up in his anger and consuming fire out of his mouth: coals flamed forth from him.
019	PSA	018	009	And he bent the heavens, and came down: and thick darkness was under his feet:
019	PSA	018	010	And he rode upon a cherub, and flew along, and he flitted by upon the wings of the wind.
019	PSA	018	011	He made darkness his hiding-place, round about him as his pavilion, dark waters, thick clouds of the skies.
019	PSA	018	012	From the brightness before him his thick clouds passed away, [with] hail-stones and coals of fire.
019	PSA	018	013	And the Lord thundered in the heavens, and the Most High uttered forth his voice, [with] hail-stones and coals of fire.
019	PSA	018	014	And he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot forth lightnings, and discomfited them.
019	PSA	018	015	And then were seen the channels of the waters, and there were laid open the foundations of the world, through thy rebuke, O Lord, through the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.
019	PSA	018	016	He stretched out from above [his hand], he took me; he drew me out from mighty waters.
019	PSA	018	017	He delivered me from my enemy, the strong, and from those that hated me, when they were too mighty for me.
019	PSA	018	018	They overcame me on the day of my calamity; but the Lord became my stay.
019	PSA	018	019	And he brought me forth into a large space; he delivered me, because he had delight in me.
019	PSA	018	020	The Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the purity of my hands did he recompense me.
019	PSA	018	021	For I have kept the ways of the Lord, and have not wickedly departed from my God.
019	PSA	018	022	For all his ordinances were before me, and his statutes had I not put away from me.
019	PSA	018	023	I was also upright with him, and I guarded myself against my iniquity.
019	PSA	018	024	Therefore did the Lord recompense me according to my righteousness, according to the purity of my hands before his eyes.
019	PSA	018	025	With the kind thou wilt show thyself kind; with the upright man thou wilt show thyself upright;
019	PSA	018	026	With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; and with the perverse thou wilt wage a contest.
019	PSA	018	027	For thou wilt indeed save the afflicted people; but haughty eyes wilt thou bring down.
019	PSA	018	028	For thou wilt cause my light to shine: the Lord my God will enlighten my darkness.
019	PSA	018	029	For [aided] by thee I run through a troop; and [helped] by my God I leap over a wall.
019	PSA	018	030	As for God, —his way is perfect; the word of the Lord is tried: he is a shield to all those that trust in him.
019	PSA	018	031	For who is God save the Lord? or who is a rock beside our God?
019	PSA	018	032	He is the God that girdeth me with strength, and rendereth my way unobstructed.
019	PSA	018	033	He maketh my feet like those of the hinds, and upon my high-places he causeth me to stand.
019	PSA	018	034	He teacheth my hands for the war, so that a brazen bow is bent by my arms.
019	PSA	018	035	And thou gavest me the shield of thy salvation, and thy right hand supported me: and thy meekness hath made me great.
019	PSA	018	036	Thou enlargest my steps under me, so that my joints do not slip.
019	PSA	018	037	I pursue my enemies, and overtake them; and I return not again till I have made an end of them.
019	PSA	018	038	I crush them that they are not able to rise: they fall under my feet.
019	PSA	018	039	For thou hast girded me with strength for the war: thou subduest my opponents under me.
019	PSA	018	040	And my enemies thou causest to turn their back to me; and those that hate me, —that I may destroy them.
019	PSA	018	041	They cry, but there is none to help; unto the Lord, —but he answereth them not.
019	PSA	018	042	And I beat them small as the dust before the wind: like the dirt in the streets do I cast them out.
019	PSA	018	043	Thou deliverest me from the contests of the people; thou appointest me to be the head of nations: a people that I know not shall serve me.
019	PSA	018	044	As soon as their ear heareth they shall be obedient to me: the children of the stranger shall utter flattery unto me.
019	PSA	018	045	The children of the stranger shall fade away, and come forth trembling out of their close places.
019	PSA	018	046	The Lord liveth, and blessed be my Rock; and exalted be the God of my salvation;
019	PSA	018	047	The God that granteth me vengeance, and subdueth nations under me;
019	PSA	018	048	That delivereth me from my enemies: also above my opponents thou liftest me up; thou deliverest me from the man of violence.
019	PSA	018	049	Therefore will I give thanks unto thee among the nations, O Lord, and unto thy name will I sing praises, —
019	PSA	018	050	[To him] that maketh great the salvation of his king, and who sheweth kindness to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for ever.
019	PSA	019	001	“To the chief musician, a psalm of David.” The heavens relate the glory of God; and the expanse telleth of the works of his hands.
019	PSA	019	002	Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night showeth knowledge.
019	PSA	019	003	There is no speech, there are no words, their voice is not heard.
019	PSA	019	004	[But] their melody extendeth through all the earth, and to the end of the world their words. For the sun hath he set a tabernacle among them;
019	PSA	019	005	And he goeth out as a bridegroom from his chamber, he is glad like a strong man to run his course;
019	PSA	019	006	From the end of the heavens is his going forth, and his circuit is unto their ends: and there is nothing hidden from his heat.
019	PSA	019	007	The law of the Lord is perfect, quieting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.
019	PSA	019	008	The precepts of the Lord are upright, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the Lord is clear, enlightening the eyes.
019	PSA	019	009	The fear of the Lord is pure, enduring for ever: the ordinances of the Lord are the truth, they are just altogether.
019	PSA	019	010	They are those which are to be desired more than gold, and much fine gold; and they are sweeter than honey and the dropping of honeycomb.
019	PSA	019	011	Moreover thy servant is admonished by them: in keeping them there is great reward.
019	PSA	019	012	Who can guard against errors? from secret [faults] do thou cleanse me.
019	PSA	019	013	Also from presumptuous [sins] withhold thy servant; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be blameless, and I shall be clear from any great transgression.
019	PSA	019	014	May the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable before thee, O Lord, my Rock, and my Redeemer.
019	PSA	020	001	“To the chief musician, a psalm of David.” May the Lord answer thee on the day of distress; may the name of the God of Jacob protect thee;
019	PSA	020	002	May he send thee help from the sanctuary, and support thee from Zion;
019	PSA	020	003	May he remember all thy meat-offerings, and accept in favor thy burnt-sacrifice. (Selah)
019	PSA	020	004	May he grant thee according to thy own heart, and fulfill all thy resolves.
019	PSA	020	005	We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God will we upraise our banners: may the Lord fulfill all thy petitions.
019	PSA	020	006	Now I know that the Lord saveth his anointed: he will answer him from his holy heavens, with the saving strength of his right hand.
019	PSA	020	007	Some [trust] in chariots, and some in horses; but we will invoke the name of the Lord our God.
019	PSA	020	008	They are prostrate and fallen; but we are risen up and stand erect.
019	PSA	020	009	O Lord, save [us]: may the king answer us on the day when we call [on him].
019	PSA	021	001	“To the chief musician, a psalm of David.” O Lord, because of thy strength will the king rejoice; and through thy salvation how greatly will he be glad!
019	PSA	021	002	The longing of his heart hast thou given him, and the request of his lips hast thou not withholden. (Selah)
019	PSA	021	003	For thou meetest him unasked with the blessings of happiness: thou settest on his head a crown of pure gold.
019	PSA	021	004	Life hath he asked of thee, thou gavest it to him, length of days for ever and ever.
019	PSA	021	005	Great is his honor through thy help: glory and majesty thou layest upon him.
019	PSA	021	006	For thou appointest him to be a blessing for ever: thou makest him glad with joy from thy presence.
019	PSA	021	007	For the king trusteth in the Lord; and through the kindness of the Most High shall he not be moved.
019	PSA	021	008	Thy hand will reach all thy enemies: thy right hand will reach those that hate thee.
019	PSA	021	009	Thou wilt render them as a fiery oven at the time of thy anger: the Lord in his wrath will destroy them, and a fire will devour them.
019	PSA	021	010	Their fruit wilt thou cause to perish from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.
019	PSA	021	011	For they directed against thee evil: they devised a mischievous purpose, which they were not able to perform.
019	PSA	021	012	For thou wilt make them turn their back; upon thy bow-strings thou wilt make ready [thy arrows] against their face.
019	PSA	021	013	Exalt thyself, O Lord, in thy strength; [and] we will sing and praise thy power.
019	PSA	022	001	“To the chief musician upon Ayeleth-hashachar, a psalm of David.” My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far from saving me, and from the words of my loud complaint?
019	PSA	022	002	O my God! I call in the day-time, but thou answerest not; and in the night I find no rest.
019	PSA	022	003	But thou art holy, O thou that dwellest amidst the praises of Israel.
019	PSA	022	004	In thee did our fathers trust: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them.
019	PSA	022	005	Unto thee they cried, and were delivered: in thee they trusted, and were not put to shame.
019	PSA	022	006	But I am a worm, and not a man, a reproach of men, and despised of people.
019	PSA	022	007	All those who see me laugh me to scorn: they draw open their lips, they shake their head, [saying,]
019	PSA	022	008	“Let him throw himself on the Lord, that he may deliver him: he will save him, for he delighteth in him.”
019	PSA	022	009	Yea, thou art he that took me from the womb: thou hast been my trust when I hung on my mother's breasts.
019	PSA	022	010	Upon thee was I cast from my birth: from my mother's womb art thou my God.
019	PSA	022	011	Oh be not far from me [now]; for distress is near; for there is none to help.
019	PSA	022	012	Many steers have encompassed me: the strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.
019	PSA	022	013	They have opened wide against me their mouth, [as] a ravenous and roaring lion.
019	PSA	022	014	Like water am I poured out, and all my bones are disjointed: my heart is become like wax, it is melted in the midst of my entrails.
019	PSA	022	015	Like a potsherd is my strength dried up; and my tongue cleaveth to my palate; and into the dust of death hast thou laid me down.
019	PSA	022	016	For dogs have encompassed me; the assembly of the wicked have enclosed me: like lions [they threaten] my hands and my feet.
019	PSA	022	017	I may number all my bones: [while] they stare and look upon me.
019	PSA	022	018	They divide my clothes among themselves, and for my garment do they cast lots.
019	PSA	022	019	But thou, O Lord, be not far from me: O [thou who art] my strength, hasten to my aid.
019	PSA	022	020	Deliver from the sword my life, from the power of the dog my solitary soul.
019	PSA	022	021	Save me from the lion's mouth; as thou hast answered me from the horns of the reem.
019	PSA	022	022	I will relate thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.
019	PSA	022	023	Ye that fear the Lord, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and be in dread of him, all ye the seed of Israel.
019	PSA	022	024	For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the poor; neither hath he hidden his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard.
019	PSA	022	025	Of thee shall be my praise in a great assembly: my vows will I pay in the presence of those who fear him.
019	PSA	022	026	The meek shall eat and be satisfied; they who seek him shall praise the Lord: may your heart live for ever.
019	PSA	022	027	All the ends of the world shall remember and return unto the Lord: and all the families of the nations shall bow themselves down before thee.
019	PSA	022	028	For the kingdom is the Lord's, and he governeth the nations.
019	PSA	022	029	All they that eat the fat of the earth shall bow themselves down; before him shall bend the knee all that are going down into the dust; for none can keep alive his own soul.
019	PSA	022	030	Distant ages shall serve him; there shall be related of the Lord unto future generations.
019	PSA	022	031	They will come, and will tell his righteousness unto a people yet unborn, that he hath done this.
019	PSA	023	001	“A psalm of David.” The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
019	PSA	023	002	In pastures of tender grass he causeth me to lie down: beside still waters he leadeth me.
019	PSA	023	003	My soul he refresheth: he guideth me in the tracks of righteousness for the sake of his name.
019	PSA	023	004	Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will not fear evil; for thou art with me: thy rod and thy staff—they indeed comfort me.
019	PSA	023	005	Thou preparest before me a table in the presence of my assailants; thou anointest with oil my head: my cup overfloweth.
019	PSA	023	006	Surely, only goodness and kindness shall follow me all the days of my life: and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord to the utmost length of days.
019	PSA	024	001	“Of David a psalm.” Unto the Lord belongeth the earth with what filleth it, the world and they that dwell therein;
019	PSA	024	002	For upon seas hath he founded it, and upon rivers hath he established it.
019	PSA	024	003	Who shall ascend into the mountain of the Lord? and who shall be able to stand in his holy place?
019	PSA	024	004	He that is of clean hands, and pure of heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto falsehood, and hath not sworn deceitfully:
019	PSA	024	005	He shall bear away blessing from the Lord, and [the reward of] righteousness from the God of his salvation.
019	PSA	024	006	This is the generation of those that adore him, that seek thy presence, [the sons of] Jacob. (Selah)
019	PSA	024	007	Raise your heads, O ye gates; and be raised wide, ye everlasting doors: and let the King of glory enter!
019	PSA	024	008	Who is this King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle.
019	PSA	024	009	Raise your heads, O ye gates; and raise [them] up, ye everlasting doors: and let the King of glory enter!
019	PSA	024	010	Who is then this King of glory? The Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory. (Selah)
019	PSA	025	001	“Of David.” Unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
019	PSA	025	002	O my God, in thee do I trust, let me not be ashamed, let not my enemies triumph over me.
019	PSA	025	003	Yea, none that wait on thee will be put to shame: let those be put to shame who deal treacherously without cause.
019	PSA	025	004	Show me, O Lord, thy ways; teach me thy paths.
019	PSA	025	005	Lead me in thy truth, and teach me; for thou art the God of my salvation: on thee do I wait all the day.
019	PSA	025	006	Remember thy mercies, O Lord, and thy kindnesses; for they are from everlasting.
019	PSA	025	007	The sins of my youth and my transgressions do not remember: according to thy kindness bear thou me in remembrance, for the sake of thy goodness, O Lord.
019	PSA	025	008	Good and upright is the Lord: therefore he pointeth out to sinners the right way.
019	PSA	025	009	He guideth the meek in justice, and he teacheth the meek his way.
019	PSA	025	010	All the paths of the Lord are kindness and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.
019	PSA	025	011	For the sake of thy name, O Lord, pardon my iniquity: although it is great.
019	PSA	025	012	Who is that man that feareth the Lord? to him will he point out the way which he is to choose?
019	PSA	025	013	His soul shall abide in happiness: and his seed shall inherit the land.
019	PSA	025	014	The secret counsel of the Lord is for those that fear him, and his covenant—to make it known to them.
019	PSA	025	015	My eyes are ever [directed] toward the Lord; for he will draw out of the net my feet.
019	PSA	025	016	Turn unto me, and be gracious unto me; for I am solitary and afflicted.
019	PSA	025	017	The distresses of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my afflictions.
019	PSA	025	018	Look on my misery and my trouble; and forgive all my sins.
019	PSA	025	019	Look at my enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with the hatred of violence.
019	PSA	025	020	Oh, guard my soul; and deliver me: let me not be put to shame; for I put my trust in thee.
019	PSA	025	021	Let integrity and uprightness guard me; for I wait on thee.
019	PSA	025	022	Redeem, O God, Israel out of all his distresses.
019	PSA	026	001	“Of David.” Judge me, O Lord; for I have indeed walked in my integrity: and in the Lord have I trusted; I shall not slip.
019	PSA	026	002	Try me, O Lord, and prove me; purify my reins and my heart.
019	PSA	026	003	For thy kindness is before my eyes; and I have walked in thy truth.
019	PSA	026	004	I have not sat with men of falsehood, and with dissemblers will I not enter [in communion].
019	PSA	026	005	I have hated the assemblage of evil-doers; and with the wicked will I not sit.
019	PSA	026	006	I will wash in innocency my hands, and I will compass thy altar, O Lord:
019	PSA	026	007	That I may publish with a loud voice [my] thanksgiving, and relate all thy wondrous deeds.
019	PSA	026	008	Lord, I love the site of thy house, and the place where thy glory dwelleth.
019	PSA	026	009	Take not away with sinners my soul, nor with men of blood my life;
019	PSA	026	010	In whose hands are wicked devices, and whose right hand is full of bribes.
019	PSA	026	011	But as for me, I will walk in my integrity: redeem me, and be gracious unto me.
019	PSA	026	012	My foot standeth on an even place: in assemblies will I bless the Lord.
019	PSA	027	001	“Of David.” The Lord is my light and my salvation; of whom shall I be afraid? the Lord is the fortress of my life; of whom shall I have dread?
019	PSA	027	002	When evil-doers come near against me to eat up my flesh, my assailants and my enemies at me: then do they stumble and fall.
019	PSA	027	003	If an army should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: if war should arise against me, even then will I have trust.
019	PSA	027	004	One thing have I asked of the Lord, that I will seek for: that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the loveliness of the Lord, and to be every morning early in his temple.
019	PSA	027	005	For he will hide me in his pavilion on the day of evil; he will conceal me in the secret of his tabernacle; upon a rock will he place me high.
019	PSA	027	006	And now will my head be lifted up above my enemies all round about me; and I will sacrifice in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy: I will sing, and I will triumphantly play unto the Lord.
019	PSA	027	007	Hear, O Lord, my voice, [when] I call, and be gracious unto me, and answer me.
019	PSA	027	008	Of thee, said my heart, “Seek ye my presence”: thy presence, Lord, will I seek.
019	PSA	027	009	Hide [then] not thy face from me; reject not in anger thy servant, thou [who] hast been my help: cast me not off, nor forsake me, O God of my salvation.
019	PSA	027	010	For my father and my mother have forsaken me; but the Lord will take me up.
019	PSA	027	011	Point me out thy way, O Lord! and guide me on a level path, because of those that regard me enviously.
019	PSA	027	012	Give me not up to the [revengeful] desire of my assailants; for there are risen up against me false witnesses, and such as utter violence.
019	PSA	027	013	Unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of life—
019	PSA	027	014	Wait on the Lord; be strong, and let thy heart be of good courage; and only wait on the Lord.
019	PSA	028	001	“Of David.” Unto thee, O Lord, will I call; O my rock, turn not unheeding from me: lest thou turn away silent from me, and I become like those that go down into the pit.
019	PSA	028	002	Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I lift up my hands toward the most holy place of thy sanctuary.
019	PSA	028	003	Snatch me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of injustice, who speak peace with their neighbors, with mischief in their heart.
019	PSA	028	004	Give unto them according to their doing, and according to the evil of their deeds; according to the work of their hands do thou give unto them: bestow their [just] recompense on them.
019	PSA	028	005	Because they have no regard for the doings of the Lord, nor the works of his hands: may he pull them down, and not build them up.
019	PSA	028	006	Blessed be the Lord, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications.
019	PSA	028	007	The Lord is my strength and my shield; in him hath my heart trusted, and I am helped, and my heart exulteth; and with my song will I thank him.
019	PSA	028	008	The Lord is strength unto them, and he is the fortress of victory of his anointed.
019	PSA	028	009	Help thy people, and bless thy heritage: and feed them, and exalt them unto all eternity.
019	PSA	029	001	“A psalm of David.” Ascribe unto the Lord, O ye sons of the mighty, ascribe unto the Lord glory and strength.
019	PSA	029	002	Ascribe unto the Lord the glory of his name; bow down to the Lord in the beauty of holiness.
019	PSA	029	003	The voice of the Lord is upon the waters; the God of glory thundereth, the Lord—upon mighty waters.
019	PSA	029	004	The voice of the Lord [resoundeth] with power; the voice of the Lord [resoundeth] with majesty.
019	PSA	029	005	The voice of the Lord breaketh in pieces the cedars; yea, the Lord shivereth the cedars of Lebanon;
019	PSA	029	006	And he maketh them skip like a calf; Lebanon and Siryon like young reems.
019	PSA	029	007	The voice of the Lord heweth out flames of fire.
019	PSA	029	008	The voice of the Lord shaketh the wilderness; the Lord shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh.
019	PSA	029	009	The voice of the Lord causeth the hinds to start, and maketh bare forests: and in his temple every thing speaketh [of his] glory.
019	PSA	029	010	The Lord sat [enthroned] at the flood: and the Lord will sit as King for ever.
019	PSA	029	011	The Lord will give strength unto his people: the Lord will bless his people with peace.
019	PSA	030	001	“A psalm, a song at the dedication of the temple, of David.” I will extol thee, O Lord; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast not suffered my enemies to rejoice over me.
019	PSA	030	002	O Lord my God, I cried loudly unto thee, and thou hast healed me.
019	PSA	030	003	O Lord, thou hast brought up from the nether world my soul: thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.
019	PSA	030	004	Sing unto the Lord, O ye his pious ones, and give thanks to the memorial of his holiness.
019	PSA	030	005	For his anger is momentary, [but] life is in his favor: in the evening [cometh] weeping to stay for a night, but in the morning, there is joyful song.
019	PSA	030	006	And I had said indeed in my prosperity, I shall never be moved.
019	PSA	030	007	Lord, by thy favor hadst thou caused my mountain to stand in strength: thou didst hide thy face, [and] I was terrified.
019	PSA	030	008	Unto thee, O Lord, will I call; and unto the Lord will I make supplication.
019	PSA	030	009	What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the grave? Shall the dust thank thee? shall it announce thy truth?
019	PSA	030	010	Hear, O Lord, and be gracious unto me: Lord, be thou a helper unto me.
019	PSA	030	011	Thou hast changed my mourning into dancing for me; thou hast loosened my sack-cloth, and girded me with joy.
019	PSA	030	012	To the end that my glorious soul may sing praise to thee, and never be silent. O Lord my God, for ever will I give thanks unto thee.
019	PSA	031	001	“To the chief musician, a psalm of David.” In thee, O Lord, do I put my trust; Oh that I may never be put to shame: through thy righteousness do thou release me.
019	PSA	031	002	Bend unto me thy ear; speedily deliver me: be thou unto me as a rock of protection, as a mountain strong-hold to save me.
019	PSA	031	003	For my rock and my stronghold art thou; and for the sake of thy name lead me, and guide me.
019	PSA	031	004	Draw me out of the net which they have laid secretly for me; for thou art my protection.
019	PSA	031	005	Into thy hand do I commit my spirit: thou redeemest me, O Lord, the God of truth.
019	PSA	031	006	I hate those that depend on lying vanities; but I trust indeed in the Lord.
019	PSA	031	007	I will be glad and rejoice in thy kindness; because thou hast seen my misery; thou hast taken cognizance of the distresses of my soul;
019	PSA	031	008	And thou hast not surrendered me into the hand of the enemy: thou hast caused my feet to stand on an ample space.
019	PSA	031	009	Be gracious unto me, O Lord, for I am in distress; my eye is consumed through vexation—my soul [too] and my body.
019	PSA	031	010	For my life is spent with sorrow, and my years with sighing, my strength faileth because of my iniquity, and my bones are consumed.
019	PSA	031	011	Because of all my assailants am I become a reproach, and unto my neighbors greatly so, and a terror to my acquaintance, those that see me abroad flee away from me.
019	PSA	031	012	I am forgotten as a dead man out of the heart: I am become like a perishable vessel.
019	PSA	031	013	For I have heard the slandering of many; terror was on every side, while they took counsel together against me: to take away my life did they purpose.
019	PSA	031	014	But I trusted well in thee, O Lord: I said, Thou art my God.
019	PSA	031	015	In thy hand are my destinies: deliver me from the hand of my enemies, and from my persecutors.
019	PSA	031	016	Let thy face shine upon thy servant: save me through thy kindness.
019	PSA	031	017	O Lord, let me not be put to shame; for I have called on thee: let the wicked be put to shame, let them be silent, [passing] to the nether world.
019	PSA	031	018	Let the lying lips be made dumb, which speak hard things against the righteous, with pride and contempt.
019	PSA	031	019	Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast treasured up for those that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for those that trust in thee before the sons of men!
019	PSA	031	020	Thou wilt conceal them in the secret of thy presence from the conspiracy of men: thou wilt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.
019	PSA	031	021	Blessed be the Lord: for he hath shown me his kindness wonderfully in a beleaguered city.
019	PSA	031	022	And yet had I said in my despondency, I am cut off from before thy eyes: nevertheless thou didst hear the voice of my supplications when I cried loudly unto thee.
019	PSA	031	023	Oh love the Lord, all ye his pious ones: the Lord preserveth the faithful, and recompenses the presumption of him that acteth proudly.
019	PSA	031	024	Be strong, and let your heart be of good courage, all ye that hope in the Lord.
019	PSA	032	001	“Of David: a Maskil.” Happy is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.
019	PSA	032	002	Happy is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile.
019	PSA	032	003	When I kept silence, my bones wasted away through my crying all the day.
019	PSA	032	004	For by day and night lay thy hand heavily upon me: my [life's] moisture hath been changed through the droughts of summer. (Selah)
019	PSA	032	005	My sin do I ever acknowledge unto thee, and my iniquity have I not covered up. I said, I will make confession because of my transgressions unto the Lord: and thou truly forgavest the iniquity of my sin. (Selah)
019	PSA	032	006	For this shall every pious one pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely [then] when great waters overflow, they shall never reach unto him.
019	PSA	032	007	Thou art my hiding-place; from distress wilt thou preserve me; with songs of deliverance wilt thou encompass me. (Selah)
019	PSA	032	008	I will instruct thee and I will teach thee concerning the way which thou oughtest to go: I will counsel thee with my eye.
019	PSA	032	009	Be ye not like the horse, or like the mule, who hath no understanding; who must be held in with bit and bridle, his ornament, lest he come near unto thee.
019	PSA	032	010	Many are the pains of the wicked; but him that trusteth in the Lord will he encompass with kindness.
019	PSA	032	011	Rejoice in the Lord, and be glad, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.
019	PSA	033	001	Be joyful, O ye righteous, in the Lord; [for] unto the righteous praise is comely.
019	PSA	033	002	Give thanks unto the Lord with the harp: with the ten-stringed psaltery do ye sing [praises] unto him.
019	PSA	033	003	Sing unto him a new song; play beautifully amidst a triumphant shout.
019	PSA	033	004	For the word of the Lord is upright; and all his works [are done] in truth.
019	PSA	033	005	He loveth righteousness and justice: the earth is full of the kindness of the Lord.
019	PSA	033	006	By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and by the breath of his mouth all their host.
019	PSA	033	007	He gathereth together like heaps the waters of the sea: he layeth up in store-houses the depths [of the sea].
019	PSA	033	008	Let all the earth fear the Lord: of him stand in awe all the inhabitants of the world.
019	PSA	033	009	For he spoke, and it came into being: he commanded, and it stood fast.
019	PSA	033	010	The Lord frustrateth the resolves of the nations: he bringeth to nought the thoughts of the people.
019	PSA	033	011	The counsel of the Lord will stand for ever, the thoughts of his heart from generation to generation.
019	PSA	033	012	Happy is the nation whose God is the Lord, the people whom he hath chosen for himself as a heritage.
019	PSA	033	013	The Lord looketh from heaven; he seeth all the sons of men.
019	PSA	033	014	From the place of his habitation he directeth his view upon all the inhabitants of the earth;
019	PSA	033	015	He fashioneth their hearts altogether; he hath regard to all their works.
019	PSA	033	016	The king is not saved by the multitude of an army: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength.
019	PSA	033	017	Vain is the horse for victory: nor shall he deliver any by the greatness of his strength.
019	PSA	033	018	Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon those that fear him, upon those that hope for his kindness.
019	PSA	033	019	To deliver from death their soul, and to keep them alive in famine.
019	PSA	033	020	Our soul waiteth for the Lord: our help and our shield is he.
019	PSA	033	021	For in him shall our heart rejoice: because in his holy name have we trusted.
019	PSA	033	022	Let thy kindness, O Lord, be upon us, even as we hope in thee.
019	PSA	034	001	“By David, when he disguised his reason before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he departed.” I will bless the Lord at all times: continually shall his praise be in my mouth.
019	PSA	034	002	My soul shall make her boast in the Lord: the humble shall hear it, and be rejoiced.
019	PSA	034	003	Oh magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together.
019	PSA	034	004	I sought the Lord, and he answered me, and from all that I dreaded did he deliver me.
019	PSA	034	005	They [who] looked unto him, were indeed enlightened, and their faces were not put to the blush.
019	PSA	034	006	This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and out of all his distresses did he save him.
019	PSA	034	007	The angel of the Lord encampeth round about those who fear him, and delivereth them.
019	PSA	034	008	Experience and see that the Lord is good: happy is the man that trusteth in him.
019	PSA	034	009	Oh fear the Lord, ye his saints: for there is no want to those who fear him.
019	PSA	034	010	The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger; but those who seek the Lord shall not want any good.
019	PSA	034	011	Come, ye children, hearken unto me: the fear of the Lord will I teach you.
019	PSA	034	012	Who is the man that desireth life, loveth [many] days, that he may see happiness?
019	PSA	034	013	Guard thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking deceit.
019	PSA	034	014	Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.
019	PSA	034	015	The eyes of the Lord are directed unto the righteous, and his ears unto their cry.
019	PSA	034	016	[But] the anger of the Lord is against those that do evil, to cut off from the earth their remembrance.
019	PSA	034	017	Those cry, and the Lord heareth, and from all their distresses he delivereth them.
019	PSA	034	018	The Lord is nigh unto those that are broken-hearted: and he saveth those that are of a contrite spirit.
019	PSA	034	019	Many are the afflictions of the righteous; but out of them all the Lord ever delivereth him.
019	PSA	034	020	He watcheth all his bones: not one of them is broken.
019	PSA	034	021	The evil will slay the wicked: and they who hate the righteous shall incur guiltiness.
019	PSA	034	022	The Lord redeemeth the soul of his servants: and all that trust in him shall not incur guiltiness.
019	PSA	035	001	“Of David.” Contend, O Lord, with those that contend with me: fight against those that fight against me.
019	PSA	035	002	Take hold of shield and buckler, and rise up for my help.
019	PSA	035	003	And draw out the spear, and step in against my pursuers; say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.
019	PSA	035	004	Let those be put to shame and be confounded that seek after my life: let those be turned backward and be made to blush, that devise unhappiness for me.
019	PSA	035	005	Let them be as chaff before the wind; and may the angel of the Lord cast them forth.
019	PSA	035	006	May their way be dark and slippery: and may the angel of the Lord pursue them.
019	PSA	035	007	For without cause have they hidden for me their net in a pit, without cause have they dug [pit-falls] against my life.
019	PSA	035	008	May then destruction come upon each of them at unawares; and may his net that he hath hidden catch himself: in [utter] destruction let him fall therein.
019	PSA	035	009	But my soul shall exult in the Lord: she shall be glad through his salvation.
019	PSA	035	010	All my bones will say, Lord, who is like unto thee, who deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that robbeth him?
019	PSA	035	011	There rise up witnesses of violence; concerning what I know not they question me.
019	PSA	035	012	They recompense me with evil in place of good, [bringing] bereavement on my soul.
019	PSA	035	013	But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I afflicted with fasting my soul, and my prayer returned into my own bosom.
019	PSA	035	014	As though he had been to me a friend or a brother did I walk about: as one that mourneth for a mother did I sorrowfully bend down my head.
019	PSA	035	015	But in my downfall they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together; there gathered themselves together against me abject wretches, whom I knew not; they did tear me, and ceased not:
019	PSA	035	016	With hypocritical babbling mockers, they gnashed upon me with their teeth.
019	PSA	035	017	O Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, from the young lions my solitary spirit.
019	PSA	035	018	I will thank thee in the great assembly: among a mighty people will I praise thee.
019	PSA	035	019	Let not rejoice over me those that are my enemies wrongfully: [nor] let those who hate me without cause wink with the eye.
019	PSA	035	020	For they speak not peace; but against the quiet in the land they devise deceitful words.
019	PSA	035	021	Yea, they opened wide against me their mouth; they said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it.
019	PSA	035	022	Thou hast seen it, O Lord! remain not silent: O Lord, be not far from me.
019	PSA	035	023	Arouse thyself, and awake to do me justice, my God and my Lord, unto my cause.
019	PSA	035	024	Judge me according to thy righteousness, O Lord my God; and let them not rejoice over me.
019	PSA	035	025	Let them not say in their heart, Aha, [this is the wish of] our soul: let them not say, We have swallowed him up.
019	PSA	035	026	Let those be made ashamed and put to the blush together that rejoice at my mishap; let them be clothed with shame and confusion that magnify themselves above me.
019	PSA	035	027	Let those shout, and rejoice, that desire my righteousness: yea, let them say continually, Great is the Lord, who desireth the welfare of his servant.
019	PSA	035	028	And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness, all the day of thy praise.
019	PSA	036	001	“To the chief musician, by the servant of the Lord, by David.” Saith vice itself to the wicked—so I feel it within my heart— that he should have no dread of God before his eyes.
019	PSA	036	002	For he flattereth himself in his own eyes [too much] to find out his iniquity to hate it.
019	PSA	036	003	The words of his mouth are wickedness and deceit: he hath left off to be wise, to do good.
019	PSA	036	004	He deviseth wickedness upon his couch; he placeth himself on a way that is not good; evil he despiseth not.
019	PSA	036	005	O Lord, into the heavens reacheth thy kindness, thy faithfulness even into the skies.
019	PSA	036	006	Thy righteousness is like the mountains of God; thy acts of justice like the great deep: man and beast dost thou ever help, O Lord.
019	PSA	036	007	How precious is thy kindness, O God! And the children of men that seek shelter under the shadow of thy wings, —
019	PSA	036	008	These will be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and of the stream of thy delights wilt thou give them to drink.
019	PSA	036	009	For with thee is the source of life: in thy light shall we see light.
019	PSA	036	010	Draw down continuously thy kindness unto those that acknowledge thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart.
019	PSA	036	011	Let not come against me the foot of pride, and let not the hand of the wicked chase me off.
019	PSA	036	012	There are fallen the workers of wickedness: they are thrust down, and shall not be able to rise.
019	PSA	037	001	“Of David.” Do not fret thyself because of the evil-doers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity.
019	PSA	037	002	For like the grass they shall soon be mowed down, and like the green herb shall they wither.
019	PSA	037	003	Trust in the Lord, and do good; dwell in the land, and feed [thyself] with truthfulness.
019	PSA	037	004	And delight thyself in the Lord, and he will give thee the wishes of thy heart.
019	PSA	037	005	Commit thy way unto the Lord, and trust in him: and he will accomplish it.
019	PSA	037	006	And he will bring forth as the light thy righteousness, and the justice of thy [cause] as the noonday.
019	PSA	037	007	Be silent before the Lord, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who practices wicked devices.
019	PSA	037	008	Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil.
019	PSA	037	009	For evil-doers shall be cut off; but those that wait upon the Lord, these—shall truly inherit the land.
019	PSA	037	010	For yet but for a little while, and the wicked shall be no more: yea, thou wilt look carefully at his place, and he shall not be there.
019	PSA	037	011	But the meek shall inherit the land, and shall delight themselves because of the abundance of peace.
019	PSA	037	012	The wicked purposeth evil against the just, and gnasheth against him with his teeth.
019	PSA	037	013	The Lord will laugh at him; for he seeth that his day is coming.
019	PSA	037	014	The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cause the poor and needy to fall, and to slaughter such as are of an upright course [of life].
019	PSA	037	015	[But] their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.
019	PSA	037	016	Better is the little that the righteous hath, than the great riches of many wicked.
019	PSA	037	017	For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the upholder of the righteous is the Lord.
019	PSA	037	018	The Lord regardeth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall endure for ever.
019	PSA	037	019	They shall not be made ashamed in the time of unhappiness; and in the days of famine shall they be satisfied.
019	PSA	037	020	But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the Lord shall be as the beauty of the meadow: they pass away; in smoke they pass away.
019	PSA	037	021	The wicked borroweth, and repayeth not; but the righteous is beneficent, and giveth.
019	PSA	037	022	For those blessed of him shall inherit the land; and those cursed of him shall be cut off.
019	PSA	037	023	By the Lord are the steps of the righteous man established; and he findeth pleasure in his course [of life].
019	PSA	037	024	Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down; for the Lord upholdeth his hand.
019	PSA	037	025	I have been young, and I am also grown old: yet have I never seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed seeking for bread.
019	PSA	037	026	He is all the time beneficent, and lendeth: and his seed will be for a blessing.
019	PSA	037	027	Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.
019	PSA	037	028	For the Lord loveth justice, and never forsaketh his pious servants: they are for ever preserved; but the seed of the wicked will be cut off.
019	PSA	037	029	The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell for ever therein.
019	PSA	037	030	The mouth of the righteous uttereth wisdom, and his tongue speaketh what is just.
019	PSA	037	031	The law of his God is in his heart: none of his steps shall slip.
019	PSA	037	032	The wicked looketh out for the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.
019	PSA	037	033	The Lord will not leave him in his hand, and will not condemn him when he is judged.
019	PSA	037	034	Wait on the Lord, and keep his way, and he will exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, shalt thou look on.
019	PSA	037	035	I have seen the wicked terrible in power, and striking root like a green tree in its native soil.
019	PSA	037	036	Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was no more: and I sought him, but he could not be found.
019	PSA	037	037	Observe the perfect man, and behold the upright; for there is a [happy] future for the man of peace.
019	PSA	037	038	But the transgressors are destroyed together: the future of the wicked is cut off.
019	PSA	037	039	And the salvation of the righteous is from the Lord: he is their strong-hold in the time of distress.
019	PSA	037	040	And the Lord helpeth them, and delivereth them; he will deliver them from the wicked, and save them; because they have put their trust in him.
019	PSA	038	001	“A psalm of David, to bring to remembrance.” O Lord, correct me not in thy wrath, nor chastise me in thy fury.
019	PSA	038	002	For thy arrows have penetrated into me, and thy hand presseth down upon me.
019	PSA	038	003	There is no soundness in my flesh because of thy indignation: there is no peace in my bones because of my sin.
019	PSA	038	004	For my iniquities are passed over my head, as a heavy burden are they too heavy for me.
019	PSA	038	005	Foul, corrupt are my bruises because of my folly.
019	PSA	038	006	I am bent double; I am bowed down to the utmost; all the day long I go about full of grief.
019	PSA	038	007	For my loins are filled with a burning disease, and there is no soundness in my flesh.
019	PSA	038	008	I am made faint and crushed to the utmost; I cry aloud because of the groaning of my heart.
019	PSA	038	009	Lord, before thee is all my longing; and my sighing is from thee not hidden.
019	PSA	038	010	My heart is restless, my strength hath left me; and the light of my eyes—that also is no more with me.
019	PSA	038	011	My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague; and my kinsmen stand afar off.
019	PSA	038	012	They also that seek after my life lay snares; and they that wish for my mishap speak wicked falsehoods; and deceits do they devise all the day long.
019	PSA	038	013	But I, as a deaf man, hear not; and I am as a dumb man that cannot open his mouth.
019	PSA	038	014	Thus am I as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no words of defence.
019	PSA	038	015	For in thee, O Lord, do I hope: thou wilt answer, O Lord my God.
019	PSA	038	016	For I said, Perhaps they might rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they might magnify themselves over me.
019	PSA	038	017	For I am prepared for [my] downfall, and my pain is continually before me.
019	PSA	038	018	For I will tell of my iniquity; I will be grieved because of my sin.
019	PSA	038	019	But my enemies are strong in life; and numerous are those that hate me wrongfully;
019	PSA	038	020	They also that repay [me] evil in lieu of good; they hate me bitterly because I pursue what is good.
019	PSA	038	021	Forsake me not, O Lord: O my God, be not far from me.
019	PSA	038	022	Make haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation.
019	PSA	039	001	“To the chief musician, to Jeduthun, a psalm of David.” I said, I will guard my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will guard my mouth with a muzzle, while the wicked is before me.
019	PSA	039	002	I was dumb in deep silence, I was quite still, even from [speaking] good; but my pain was greatly excited;
019	PSA	039	003	My heart was hot within me, in my self-communing there burnt a fire: [then] spoke I with my tongue,
019	PSA	039	004	Let me know, O Lord, my end, and the measure of my days, what it is: I wish to know when I shall cease to be.
019	PSA	039	005	Behold, measured out with the span hast thou made my days; and my whole duration is nothing before thee: yea, as nothing but vanity doth every man stand here. (Selah)
019	PSA	039	006	As nothing but a shadowy image doth man walk about, yea, for vanity only do all make a noise: he heapeth up his gains, and knoweth not who shall gather them.
019	PSA	039	007	And now, what shall I wait for, O Lord? my hope is in thee.
019	PSA	039	008	From all my transgressions deliver thou me: render me not the object of reproach of the worthless.
019	PSA	039	009	I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou hadst done it.
019	PSA	039	010	Remove thou thy plague away from me: from the blows of thy hand am I consumed.
019	PSA	039	011	When thou with corrections chastisest man for iniquity, thou causest his excellence to melt away as [if eaten by] the moth: yea, nothing but vanity is every man. (Selah)
019	PSA	039	012	Hear my prayer, O Lord, and give ear unto my cry; be not silent at my tears; for a stranger am I with thee, a sojourner, like all my fathers.
019	PSA	039	013	Leave off from me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and am no more.
019	PSA	040	001	“To the chief musician, a psalm of David.” I had waited patiently for the Lord, when he inclined himself unto me, and heard my cry.
019	PSA	040	002	And he brought me up out of the noiseful deep, out of the miry clay, and he set up my feet upon a rock, making firm my steps.
019	PSA	040	003	And he placed in my mouth a new song, a praise unto our God: many will see it, and fear; and they will trust in the Lord.
019	PSA	040	004	Happy is the man that maketh the Lord his trust, and turneth not unto the proud, nor such as stray aside unto lies.
019	PSA	040	005	Many things hast thou done, O Lord my God; thy wonderful deeds and thy thoughts toward us—there is none to be compared unto thee—will I tell and speak of, [though] they are too numerous to be counted.
019	PSA	040	006	Sacrifice and meat-offering thou desirest not—ears hast thou hollowed out unto me—burnt-offering and sin-offering thou demandest not.
019	PSA	040	007	Then said I, Lo, I come: in the roll of the book it is written down for me;
019	PSA	040	008	To fulfill thy will, O my God, do I desire; and thy law is within my heart.
019	PSA	040	009	I announce [thy] righteousness in the great assembly: lo, I will not refrain my lips, O Lord, thou well knowest it.
019	PSA	040	010	Thy righteousness have I never hidden within my heart; thy faithfulness and thy salvation have I spoken of openly: I have not concealed thy kindness and thy truth before the great assembly.
019	PSA	040	011	Do thou, O Lord, not withhold thy mercies from me: let thy kindness and thy truth continually watch over me.
019	PSA	040	012	For evils without number have compassed me about; my iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to see: they are more numerous than the hairs of my head; and my courage hath forsaken me.
019	PSA	040	013	Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me; O Lord, hasten to my help.
019	PSA	040	014	May those be made ashamed and put to the blush together that seek after my soul to take her away: let them be driven backward and be confounded, that wish for my mishap.
019	PSA	040	015	May they be astonished in consequence of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha!
019	PSA	040	016	[But] may all those that seek thee be glad and rejoice in thee: may they say continually, The Lord be magnified, —those that love thy salvation.
019	PSA	040	017	But though I be poor and needy, the Lord will think of me: my help and my deliverer art thou: O my God, delay not.
019	PSA	041	001	“To the chief musician, a psalm of David.” Happy is he that careth for the poor: on the day of evil will the Lord deliver him.
019	PSA	041	002	The Lord will preserve him, and keep him alive; he shall be made happy on the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the revengeful desire of his enemies.
019	PSA	041	003	The Lord will sustain him upon the bed of painful disease: thou changest all his couch in his sickness.
019	PSA	041	004	I said, Lord, be gracious unto me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee.
019	PSA	041	005	My enemies speak evil of me, When will he die, and his name perish?
019	PSA	041	006	And if he come to see [me], he speaketh falsely: his heart gathereth wickedness to itself; he goeth abroad [and] speaketh it.
019	PSA	041	007	Altogether whisper against me all that hate me: against me do they devise my injury.
019	PSA	041	008	“His godless deed [say they] is poured out over him: as he lieth there he will never more rise up again.”
019	PSA	041	009	Yea, even the man that should have sought my welfare, in whom I trusted, who eateth my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.
019	PSA	041	010	But thou, O Lord, be gracious unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite it unto them.
019	PSA	041	011	By this do I know that thou art pleased with me, that my enemy doth not triumph over me.
019	PSA	041	012	But as for me, thou upholdest me in my integrity, and placest me before thy presence for ever.
019	PSA	041	013	Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen. BEGIM
019	PSA	042	001	BOOK SECOND: “To the chief musician, a Maskil, for the sons of Korach.” As a hart panteth after brooks of water, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.
019	PSA	042	002	My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I go [again] and be seen in the presence of God?
019	PSA	042	003	My tears have been my food day and night; because men say unto me all the day, Where is thy God?
019	PSA	042	004	These things will I remember, and pour out my soul in me: how I was wont to pass along amidst the multitude, journeying with them as a pilgrim to the house of God, with the voice of joyful song and thanksgiving, among the festive throng.
019	PSA	042	005	Why art thou cast down, O my soul, and disquieted in me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet thank him, because of the salvation of his countenance.
019	PSA	042	006	O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I remember thee from the land of the Jordan, and from the peaks of Chermon, from the low mount.
019	PSA	042	007	Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterfalls: all thy waves and thy billows have passed over me.
019	PSA	042	008	In the daytime the Lord will command his kindness, and in the night his song shall be with me, as a prayer unto the God of my life.
019	PSA	042	009	I will say unto God, my rock, why hast thou forgotten me? why must I walk grieved, under the oppression of the enemy?
019	PSA	042	010	It is as death in my bones, when my assailants reproach me; when they say unto me all the day, Where is thy God?
019	PSA	042	011	Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within met? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet thank him, the salvation of my countenance, and my God.
019	PSA	043	001	Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: from the deceitful and unjust man do thou deliver me.
019	PSA	043	002	For thou art the God of my fortress: why hast thou abandoned me? why must I walk about grieved, under the oppression of the enemy?
019	PSA	043	003	Send thou thy light and thy truth, these shall guide me; they shall bring me unto thy holy mountain, and to thy dwellings:
019	PSA	043	004	That I may go unto the altar of God, unto God the joy of my gladness; and that I may thank thee upon the harp, O God, my God.
019	PSA	043	005	Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet thank him, the salvation of my countenance, and my God.
019	PSA	044	001	“To the chief musician, for the sons of Korach, a Maskil.” O God, with our ears have we heard, our fathers have told us, deeds which thou hadst done in their days, in times of old.
019	PSA	044	002	Thou, with thy hand, didst indeed drive out nations, and plant them; thou didst ill-treat people, and cause them to spread out.
019	PSA	044	003	For not by their sword did they obtain possession of the land, and their own arm brought them no victory; but thy right hand, and thy arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst given them thy favor.
019	PSA	044	004	Thou art my King, O God: ordain salvation for Jacob.
019	PSA	044	005	Through thee will we butt down our assailants: through thy name will we tread under foot our opponents.
019	PSA	044	006	For not in my bow will I trust, and my sword shall not help me.
019	PSA	044	007	But thou helpest us against our assailants, and those that hate us thou puttest to shame.
019	PSA	044	008	Of God we boast all the day, and to thy name will we give thanks for ever. (Selah)
019	PSA	044	009	But [now] thou hast cast off, and put us to the blush, and goest not forth with our armies.
019	PSA	044	010	Thou causest us to turn back from before our assailant: and they who hate us take spoil for themselves.
019	PSA	044	011	Thou givest us up like sheep for food, and among the nations hast thou dispersed us.
019	PSA	044	012	Thou sellest thy people for no value, and acquirest no gain by their price.
019	PSA	044	013	Thou renderest us a reproach to our neighbors, a scorn and a derision to those that are round about us.
019	PSA	044	014	Thou renderest us a by-word among the nations, a shaking of the head among the people.
019	PSA	044	015	All the day is my disgrace before me, and the shame of my face covereth me;
019	PSA	044	016	Because of the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and him that seeketh vengeance.
019	PSA	044	017	All this is come over us, yet have we not forgotten thee; nor have we dealt falsely by thy covenant;
019	PSA	044	018	Our heart is not moved backward, nor hath our step turned aside from thy path:
019	PSA	044	019	Even when thou didst crush us in the abode of monsters, and cover us with the shadow of death.
019	PSA	044	020	If we had forgotten the name of our God, or spread forth our hands to a strange God:
019	PSA	044	021	Would not God search out this? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.
019	PSA	044	022	But for thy sake are we slain all the day; we are counted as flocks [destined] for slaughter.
019	PSA	044	023	Awake, wherefore wilt thou sleep, O Lord? arise, abandon us not for ever.
019	PSA	044	024	Wherefore wilt thou hide thy face, wilt thou forget our misery, and our oppression?
019	PSA	044	025	For our soul is bowed down to the dust; our body cleaveth unto the earth.
019	PSA	044	026	Arise unto our help, and redeem us for the sake of thy kindness.
019	PSA	045	001	“To the chief musician upon Shoshannim, by the sons of Korach, a Maskil, a song of love.” My heart swelleth with a good speech; I say, “My works shall be for the king:” my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.
019	PSA	045	002	Thou art more fair than the children of men; grace is poured out over thy lips: therefore hath God blessed thee for ever.
019	PSA	045	003	Gird thy sword upon the thigh, O mighty one, [it is] thy glory and thy majesty;
019	PSA	045	004	Yea, it is thy majesty: be prosperous, ride along for the cause of truth and meekness and righteousness; and fearful things shall thy right hand teach thee.
019	PSA	045	005	Thy sharpened arrows—people will fall down beneath thee—[will enter] into the heart of the king's enemies.
019	PSA	045	006	Thy throne, given of God, endureth for ever and ever: the sceptre of equity is the sceptre of thy kingdom.
019	PSA	045	007	Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore hath God, thy God, anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy associates.
019	PSA	045	008	Of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia are [fragrant] all thy garments: out of palaces of ivory have they made thee joyful with the sound of music.
019	PSA	045	009	Kings' daughters are among those dear to thee: the queen standeth on thy right hand in fine gold of Ophir.
019	PSA	045	010	Hearken, O daughter, and look, and incline thy ear, and forget thy own people, and thy father's house:
019	PSA	045	011	Then will the king long for thy beauty; for he is thy Lord; and bow thyself to him.
019	PSA	045	012	And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift: the rich among the people shall entreat thy favor.
019	PSA	045	013	All gloriously attired awaiteth the king's daughter in the inner chamber: of wrought gold is her garment.
019	PSA	045	014	In embroidered clothes will she be brought unto the king: virgins that follow her, her companions, are brought unto thee.
019	PSA	045	015	They are led forth with rejoicings and gladness, they enter into the palace of the king.
019	PSA	045	016	Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children: thou wilt appoint them as princes in all the land.
019	PSA	045	017	I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.
019	PSA	046	001	“To the chief musician: by the sons of Korach, upon 'Alamoth, a song.” God is our protection and strength, a help in distresses, very readily found.
019	PSA	046	002	Therefore will we not fear, even when the earth is transformed, and when mountains are moved into the heart of the seas;
019	PSA	046	003	[When] the waters thereof roar and foam, when mountains quake before his majesty. (Selah)
019	PSA	046	004	[There] is a river, its rivulets cause to rejoice the city of God, the sanctuary of the dwellings of the Most High.
019	PSA	046	005	God is in her midst; she shall not be moved: God will ever help her, at the dawning of [her] morning.
019	PSA	046	006	Nations rage, kingdoms are moved: he letteth his voice be heard, the earth melteth away.
019	PSA	046	007	The Lord of hosts is with us; a defense unto us is the God of Jacob. (Selah)
019	PSA	046	008	Come, look at the deeds of the Lord, who hath made desolations on the earth.
019	PSA	046	009	He causeth wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in pieces; he burneth wagons in the fire.
019	PSA	046	010	Leave off, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted on the earth.
019	PSA	046	011	The Lord of hosts is with us; a defence unto us is the God of Jacob. (Selah)
019	PSA	047	001	“To the chief musician, a psalm for the sons of Korach.” All ye people, clap your hands; shout unto God with the voice of triumph.
019	PSA	047	002	For the Lord is most high, fear-inspiring; he is a great king over all the earth.
019	PSA	047	003	He will subdue people under us, and nations under our feet.
019	PSA	047	004	He will choose for us our inheritance, the excellency of Jacob which he loveth. (Selah)
019	PSA	047	005	God ascendeth amid a triumphal shout, the Lord, amid the sound of the cornet.
019	PSA	047	006	Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King, sing praises.
019	PSA	047	007	For God is King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding.
019	PSA	047	008	God reigneth over the nations; God sitteth upon his holy throne.
019	PSA	047	009	The nobles of the people are gathered together, [to be with] the people of the God of Abraham; for unto God belong the shields of the earth: he is greatly exalted.
019	PSA	048	001	“A song and psalm by the sons of Korach.” Great is the Lord, and highly praised in the city of our God, [in] his holy mountain.
019	PSA	048	002	A beautiful district, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, the farthest north, the city of the great King.
019	PSA	048	003	God is become known in her palaces as a defence.
019	PSA	048	004	For, lo, the kings were assembled, they are passed away together.
019	PSA	048	005	They indeed saw—[and] so they were astonished; they were terrified, they were confounded.
019	PSA	048	006	Trembling seized on them there, pain, as on a woman in travail.
019	PSA	048	007	With the east wind thou breakest the ships of Tharshish.
019	PSA	048	008	As we have heard, so have we seen [it] in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. (Selah)
019	PSA	048	009	We have reflected on thy kindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple.
019	PSA	048	010	As thy name is, O God, so is thy praise over the ends of the earth: of righteousness is thy right hand full.
019	PSA	048	011	Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments.
019	PSA	048	012	Compass Zion about, and walk round about her; number her towers.
019	PSA	048	013	Direct your mind to her outer wall, mark carefully her palaces: in order that ye may tell it to the latest generation.
019	PSA	048	014	For this One is God, our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death.
019	PSA	049	001	“To the chief musician, by the sons of Korach, a psalm.” Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the perishable world:
019	PSA	049	002	Both the sons of the low and the sons of the high, rich and needy, altogether.
019	PSA	049	003	My mouth shall speak wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.
019	PSA	049	004	I will incline my ear to a parable: I will open with the harp my riddle.
019	PSA	049	005	Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my oppressors encompasseth me?—
019	PSA	049	006	Of those that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves of the multitude of their riches?
019	PSA	049	007	No one can in any wise redeem his brother, nor can he give to God redemption money for himself;
019	PSA	049	008	For the ransom of their soul is too costly, and it is omitted for ever.
019	PSA	049	009	And should he still live for ever? not see the pit?
019	PSA	049	010	For he must see that wise men die, that together the fool and the brutish person perish and leave to others their wealth.
019	PSA	049	011	Their inward thought is, that their houses are to be for ever, their dwelling-places, from generation to generation; they call them by their own names in [various] countries.
019	PSA	049	012	Nevertheless man in [his] splendor endureth not: he is like the beasts [that] perish.
019	PSA	049	013	This is their way, their folly: yet their posterity will take pleasure in their sayings. (Selah)
019	PSA	049	014	Like flocks are they thrust into the nether world; death will feed them; but the upright shall have dominion over them in that morning, and their form wasteth away in the nether world, [taken away] from their own dwelling.
019	PSA	049	015	But God will redeem my soul from the power of the nether world; for he will take me away. (Selah)
019	PSA	049	016	Be not thou afraid when a man becometh rich, when the glory of his house is increased;
019	PSA	049	017	For when he dieth he can take nothing away; his glory will not descend after him.
019	PSA	049	018	For though he bless his soul during his life, and men praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself:
019	PSA	049	019	She shall go to the generation of his fathers, unto eternity will these never see light.
019	PSA	049	020	Man, though in splendor, who understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish. °
019	PSA	050	001	“A psalm of Assaph.” The God of gods, the Lord, speaketh, and calleth the earth, from the rising of the sun unto his setting.
019	PSA	050	002	Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shineth forth.
019	PSA	050	003	Our God is coming, and will not keep silence: a fire devoureth before him, and round him there rageth a mighty storm.
019	PSA	050	004	He will call to the heavens above, and to the earth, to judge his people.
019	PSA	050	005	“Gather together unto me my pious servants, who make a covenant with me by sacrifice.”
019	PSA	050	006	And the heavens tell of his righteousness; for God is judge himself. (Selah)
019	PSA	050	007	“Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: God, thy God, am I.
019	PSA	050	008	Not because of thy sacrifices will I reprove thee; and thy burnt-offerings are continually before me.
019	PSA	050	009	I will not take a bullock out of thy house, nor he-goats out of thy folds.
019	PSA	050	010	For mine are all the beasts of the forest, the cattle upon a thousand mountains.
019	PSA	050	011	I know all the fowls of the mountains: whatever moveth on the fields is with me.
019	PSA	050	012	If I were hungry, I would not say it to thee; for mine is the world, and what filleth it.
019	PSA	050	013	Do I eat the flesh of fatted bulls, or drink the blood of he-goats?
019	PSA	050	014	Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay unto the Most High thy vows;
019	PSA	050	015	And call on me on the day of distress: I will deliver thee, — and so wilt thou glorify me.”
019	PSA	050	016	But unto the wicked God saith, “What hast thou to do to relate my statutes, and why bearest thou my covenant upon thy mouth?
019	PSA	050	017	And yet thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee.
019	PSA	050	018	When thou seest a thief, then art thou pleased with him, and with adulterers hast thou thy portion.
019	PSA	050	019	Thou lettest loose thy mouth with evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.
019	PSA	050	020	Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; against thy own mother's son thou utterest slander.
019	PSA	050	021	These things hast thou done, and I kept silence: thou didst ween that I am like thyself; [but] I will reprove thee, and set it in order before thy eyes.”
019	PSA	050	022	Do but reflect on this, ye that forget God, lest I tear [you] in pieces, with none to deliver.
019	PSA	050	023	Whoso offereth thanksgiving glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth his course aright, will I show the salvation of God.
019	PSA	051	001	“To the chief musician, a psalm of David, When Nathan the prophet came unto him, after he had gone in unto Bath-sheba'.” Be gracious unto me, O God, according to thy kindness: according to the greatness of thy mercies blot out my transgressions.
019	PSA	051	002	Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
019	PSA	051	003	For of my transgressions I have full knowledge; and my sin is before me continually.
019	PSA	051	004	To thee, thee only, have I sinned, and what is evil in thy eyes have I done: —in order that thou mightest be righteous when thou speakest, be justified when thou judgest.
019	PSA	051	005	Behold, in iniquity was I brought forth; and in sin did my mother conceive me.
019	PSA	051	006	Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: therefore do thou cause me to know wisdom in the recesses [of the heart].
019	PSA	051	007	Cleanse me from sin with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
019	PSA	051	008	Cause me to hear gladness and joy; that the bones which thou hast crushed may rejoice.
019	PSA	051	009	Hide thy face from my sins, and all my iniquities do thou blot out.
019	PSA	051	010	Create unto me a clean heart, O God; and a firm spirit renew thou within me.
019	PSA	051	011	Cast me not away from thy presence; and thy holy spirit do not take from me.
019	PSA	051	012	Restore unto me the gladness of thy salvation; and with a liberal spirit do thou support me.—
019	PSA	051	013	I will teach transgressors thy ways, and sinners shall return unto thee.
019	PSA	051	014	Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation; [that] my tongue may sing aloud of thy righteousness.
019	PSA	051	015	O Lord, open thou my lips, and my mouth shall declare thy praise.
019	PSA	051	016	For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: in burnt-offering hast thou no delight.
019	PSA	051	017	The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, wilt thou not despise.
019	PSA	051	018	Do good in thy favor unto Zion; build thou the walls of Jerusalem.
019	PSA	051	019	Then wilt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt-offering and entire offering: then shall bullocks be offered upon thy altar.
019	PSA	052	001	“To the chief musician, a Maskil of David, When Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, and said unto him, David is come to the house of Achimelech.” What vauntest thou thyself of wickedness, O mighty man? the kindness of God endureth all the time.
019	PSA	052	002	Thy tongue deviseth mischiefs, like a sharpened razor, thou worker of deceit.
019	PSA	052	003	Thou lovest evil more than good; falsehood more than speaking righteousness. (Selah)
019	PSA	052	004	Thou lovest all words of destruction, the tongue of deceit.
019	PSA	052	005	[Therefore] God will also destroy thee for ever: he will take thee away, and pluck thee out of his tent, and root thee out of the land of life. (Selah)
019	PSA	052	006	And the righteous shall see it, and they will be afraid, and laugh concerning him:
019	PSA	052	007	“Lo, this is the man that made not God his fortress; but trusted in the abundance of his riches, relied proudly on his mischievous wickedness.”
019	PSA	052	008	But I am like a green olive-tree in the house of God: I trust in the kindness of God for ever and ever.
019	PSA	052	009	I will thank thee for ever, because thou hast done it: and I will wait on thy name, for [it is] good, before thy pious ones.
019	PSA	053	001	“To the chief musician upon Machalath, a Maskil of David.” The worthless fool saith in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, and they are abominable [in their] injustice: there is none that doth good.
019	PSA	053	002	God looketh down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there be one intelligent, one who seeketh for God.
019	PSA	053	003	Every one [of them] hath departed [from righteousness]; altogether are they become corrupt: there is none that doth good, no, not one.
019	PSA	053	004	Is there no knowledge in the workers of wickedness? who eat up my people as they eat bread: [while] they do not call on God.
019	PSA	053	005	There were they terrified with terror where there was no terror; for God had scattered the bones of those that encamped against thee: thou didst put them to shame, because God had rejected them.
019	PSA	053	006	Oh that some one might bring the salvation of Israel out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, [then] will Jacob be glad, [and] Israel will rejoice.
019	PSA	054	001	“To the chief musician on Neginoth, a Maskil of David, When the Ziphim came and said to Saul, Behold, David is hiding himself with us.” O God, by thy name save me, and by thy strength grant me justice.
019	PSA	054	002	O God, hear my prayer; give ear to the words of my mouth.
019	PSA	054	003	For strangers [to goodness] are risen up against me, and powerful oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them. (Selah)
019	PSA	054	004	Behold, God is a helper unto me: the Lord is among those that uphold my soul.
019	PSA	054	005	He will cause the evil to return upon those that regard me with envy: in thy truth cut them off.
019	PSA	054	006	I will liberally sacrifice unto thee: I will give thanks unto thy name, O Lord; for it is good.
019	PSA	054	007	For out of all distress hath he delivered me: and my eye hath seen [its desire] on my enemies.
019	PSA	055	001	“To the chief musician on Neginoth, a Maskil of David.” Give ear, O God, to my prayer, and hide not thyself from my supplication.
019	PSA	055	002	Listen unto me, and answer me: I mourn in my grief, and moan;
019	PSA	055	003	Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked; for they cast wrong upon me, and in wrath they attack me.
019	PSA	055	004	My heart is sorely pained within me, and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.
019	PSA	055	005	Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and shuddering hath covered me.
019	PSA	055	006	And I said, Oh that some one would give me wings like a dove! I would fly away and dwell [quietly].
019	PSA	055	007	Lo, I would flee far away, I would spend my night in the wilderness. (Selah)
019	PSA	055	008	I would prepare hastily a refuge for me from the sweeping wind [and] from storm.
019	PSA	055	009	Destroy, O Lord, divide their tongue; for I have seen violence and strife in the city;
019	PSA	055	010	Day and night do these encompass it upon her walls: and wrong and trouble are in her midst.
019	PSA	055	011	Mischief is in her midst: guile and deceit depart not from her streets.
019	PSA	055	012	For it is not an enemy that reproached me; then I could bear it: not he that hateth me hath magnified himself against me; then I would have hidden myself from him;
019	PSA	055	013	But it is thou, a man my equal, my guide, and my acquaintance;
019	PSA	055	014	So that we took sweet secret counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in tumultuous company.
019	PSA	055	015	Let him dispense death over them; let them go down alive into the nether world; for evil is in their dwelling, in the midst of them.
019	PSA	055	016	I, however, will call on God: and the Lord will save me.
019	PSA	055	017	At evening and morning and noon will I make my complaint and moan: and he heareth my voice.—
019	PSA	055	018	He delivereth my soul in peace from the battle against me; for in multitudes are they [contending] with me.
019	PSA	055	019	God will hear, and humble them—yea, he that sitteth enthroned from the oldest time Selah—those who dread no changes, and fear not God.
019	PSA	055	020	He stretcheth out his hands against those at peace with him: he violateth his covenant.
019	PSA	055	021	The creamy words of his mouth are smooth, yet there is war [in] his heart; his words are softer than oil, yet are they drawn swords.
019	PSA	055	022	Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he will sustain thee: he will never suffer the righteous to be moved.
019	PSA	055	023	But thou, O God, thou wilt bring them down into the pit of destruction: let not the men of blood and deceit live out half their days; but I will indeed trust in thee.
019	PSA	056	001	“To the chief musician upon Jonath-elem-rechokim, by David, a Michtham, when the Philistines seized him in Gath.” Be gracious unto me, O God; for man longeth to swallow me up; all the time he oppresseth me fighting.
019	PSA	056	002	Those that regard me with envy long to swallow [me] up all the time; for many are they that fight against me, O thou Most High.
019	PSA	056	003	The day [when] I am afraid, I will still trust in thee.
019	PSA	056	004	In God will I praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not be afraid: what can flesh do unto me?
019	PSA	056	005	All the day they wrest my words: against me are all their thoughts for evil.
019	PSA	056	006	They come together in troops, they hide themselves, they are those that watch my heels, as though they hoped [to take] my soul.
019	PSA	056	007	Because of their wrong-doing let me escape from them: in anger cast down the people, O God.
019	PSA	056	008	My wanderings hast thou well numbered: put thou my tears into thy bottle; behold, they are numbered by thee.
019	PSA	056	009	Then shall my enemies retire backward on the day when I call [on thee]: this I know—that God is for me.
019	PSA	056	010	In God will I praise the word: in the Lord will I praise the word.
019	PSA	056	011	In God have I put my trust; I will not be afraid: what can man do unto me?
019	PSA	056	012	Upon me, O God, [rest] thy vows: I will pay thanksgiving offerings unto thee.
019	PSA	056	013	For thou hast delivered my soul from death—yea, behold, my feet from slipping, that I may walk before God in the light of the life.
019	PSA	057	001	“To the chief musician, Al-tashcheth, by David, a Michtham, when he fled from Saul, in the cave.” Be gracious unto me, O God, be gracious unto me; for in thee my soul seeketh protection, and under the shadow of thy wings will I seek protection, until the mischief be passed away.
019	PSA	057	002	I will call unto God, the Most High; unto God that accomplisheth [his kindness] on me.
019	PSA	057	003	He will send from heaven, and save me, though he that longeth to swallow me up utter reproach. (Selah) God will send forth his kindness and his truth.
019	PSA	057	004	My soul is in the midst of lions; I lie down [in the midst of] those that send out flames, [those] sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and whose tongue is a sharpened sword.
019	PSA	057	005	Be thou exalted above the heavens, O God: above all the earth let thy glory be.
019	PSA	057	006	A net have they prepared for my steps; my soul hath been bent down; they have dug before me a pit; they are fallen into the midst thereof. (Selah)
019	PSA	057	007	Firm is my heart, O God, firm is my heart: I will sing and play.
019	PSA	057	008	Awake, my spirit; awake, psaltery and harp: I will wake up the morning-dawn.
019	PSA	057	009	I will thank thee among the people, O Lord: I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.
019	PSA	057	010	For great, even unto the heavens, is thy kindness, and even unto the skies [extendeth] thy truth.
019	PSA	057	011	Be thou exalted above the heavens, O God: above all the earth let thy glory be.
019	PSA	058	001	“To the chief musician Al-tashcheth, by David, a Michtham.” Do you indeed, who are dumb, speak righteously? do ye judge in uprightness, O ye sons of men?
019	PSA	058	002	Even in [your] heart ye work injustice: on the earth do ye weigh out the violence of your hands.
019	PSA	058	003	The wicked are estranged [from goodness] from the womb: those who speak lies go astray from their very birth.
019	PSA	058	004	They have poison like the poison of a serpent: [they are] like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear;
019	PSA	058	005	Which will not hearken to the voice of conjurers, yea, that of the wisest of all charmers.
019	PSA	058	006	O God, break out their teeth in their mouth: the jaw-teeth of the young lions tear thou out, O Lord.
019	PSA	058	007	Let them melt away as water [which] runneth off: when each one bendeth [his bow to shoot] his arrows, let them be as if cut in pieces.
019	PSA	058	008	As a snail which melteth, let him pass away; like the untimely birth of a woman which hath not seen the sun.
019	PSA	058	009	Before your pots can feel the thorns, will he take them away with a whirlwind, both the green and the burning.
019	PSA	058	010	The righteous will rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he will bathe his steps in the blood of the wicked.
019	PSA	058	011	So that a man shall say, Verily fruit will come for the righteous: verily there is a God that judgeth on the earth.
019	PSA	059	001	“To the chief musician, Al-tashcheth, by David, a Michtham, when Saul sent, and they watched the house to put him to death.” Deliver me from my enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me.
019	PSA	059	002	Deliver me from the workers of wickedness, and from men of blood do thou save me.
019	PSA	059	003	For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul, the mighty are gathered in troops against me: not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O Lord.
019	PSA	059	004	Without guilt [in me] they run and make themselves ready: awake, [come] toward me, and behold.
019	PSA	059	005	And thou, O Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to punish all the nations: be not gracious to any treacherous wicked one. (Selah)
019	PSA	059	006	They will return at evening; they will howl like dogs, and go round about the city.
019	PSA	059	007	Behold, they sputter with their mouth: swords are in their lips; for who, [say they,] doth hear?
019	PSA	059	008	But thou, O Lord, wilt laugh at theme: thou wilt hold in derision all the nations.
019	PSA	059	009	Because of [the enemy's] strength will I wait upon thee; for God is my defence.
019	PSA	059	010	The God who showeth me kindness will go before me: God will let me see [my desire] upon those who regard me with envy.
019	PSA	059	011	Slay them not, that my people may not forget: drive them about by thy power; and bring them down, thou our shield, O Lord.
019	PSA	059	012	The sin of their mouth is the word of their lips: let them be caught through their pride, because of the cursing and lying which they relate.
019	PSA	059	013	Make an end in fury, make an end [of them], that they my be no more, and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob, as far as the ends of the earth. (Selah)
019	PSA	059	014	And they will return in the evening; they will howl like dogs, and go round about the city.
019	PSA	059	015	They will indeed roam about after something to eat, if they be not satisfied, so that they can be at rest.
019	PSA	059	016	But I will truly sing of thy strength; yea, I will sing joyfully in the morning of thy kindness; for thou hast been a defence unto me and a refuge on the day when I was distressed.
019	PSA	059	017	Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing; for God is my defence, the God of my kindness.
019	PSA	060	001	“To the chief musician upon Shushan'eduth, a Michtham of David, to teach, When he fought with Aram-naharayim, and with Aram-zobah, and Joab returned, and smote of Edom in the Salt Valley twelve thousand [men].” O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast made a breach in us, thou hast been displeased: restore now unto us [thy favor].
019	PSA	060	002	Thou hast caused the earth to quake; thou hast split it: heal her breaches; for she is moved.
019	PSA	060	003	Thou hast caused thy people to see hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of confusion.
019	PSA	060	004	Thou hast given to those that fear thee a banner, to elevate themselves, because of the truth. (Selah)
019	PSA	060	005	In order that thy beloved may be delivered: help with thy right hand, and answer me.
019	PSA	060	006	God hath spoken in his holiness: I will exult, I will divide Shechem, and the valley of Succoth will I measure out.
019	PSA	060	007	Mine is Gil'ad, and mine is Menasseh; Ephraim also is the strong-hold of my head; of Judah are my chiefs;
019	PSA	060	008	Moab is my washpot; upon Edom will I cast my shoe: Philistia, triumph thou but over me.
019	PSA	060	009	Who will bring me into the fortified city? who will lead me as far as Edom?
019	PSA	060	010	Behold, it is thou, O God, who hast cast us off; and thou, O God, goest not forth with our armies.
019	PSA	060	011	Give us help against the assailant; for vain is the help of man.
019	PSA	060	012	Through God shall we do valiantly: and he it is that will tread down our assailants.
019	PSA	061	001	“To the chief musician upon Neginah, by David.” Hear, O God, my entreaty; listen to my prayer.
019	PSA	061	002	From the end of the earth will I call unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is too high for me.
019	PSA	061	003	For thou hast been a shelter unto me, a strong tower against the enemy.
019	PSA	061	004	Let me sojourn in thy tent to all eternity; let me be sheltered under the covert of thy wings. (Selah)
019	PSA	061	005	For thou, O God, hast truly listened to my vows: thou hast given back the heritage of those that fear thy name.
019	PSA	061	006	Oh, add days unto the king's days: may his years be as of many generations.
019	PSA	061	007	May he abide for ever before God: ordain that kindness and truth may guard him.
019	PSA	061	008	So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may pay my vows day by day.
019	PSA	062	001	“To the chief musician, upon Jeduthun, a psalm of David.” Only in God my soul trusted in silence: from him cometh my salvation.
019	PSA	062	002	Only he is my rock and my salvation; [he is] my defense: I shall not be greatly moved.
019	PSA	062	003	How long will ye devise mischief against a man? will ye all assault him murderously, as though he were a falling wall, a tottering fence?
019	PSA	062	004	Yea, from his height do they take counsel to cast [him] down; they delight in lies: with their mouth do they bless, but inwardly do they curse. (Selah)
019	PSA	062	005	Yea, in God hope in silence, my soul; for from him is my expectation.
019	PSA	062	006	Only he is my rock and my salvation; [he is] my defence: I shall not be moved.
019	PSA	062	007	With God are my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength [and] my protection are in God.
019	PSA	062	008	Trust in him at all times, O ye people; pour out before him your heart: God is a protection for us. (Selah)
019	PSA	062	009	Verily nought are the sons of common men, a lie the sons of the great; they must rise in the balance; they are altogether [lighter] than nought.
019	PSA	062	010	Do not put your trust in defrauding, and be not rendered vain through robbery: if riches flourish, set not your heart [upon them].
019	PSA	062	011	Once hath God spoken; [yea,] twice [what] I have heard: that strength belongeth unto God.
019	PSA	062	012	And unto thee, O Lord, belongeth kindness; for thou wilt recompense every man according to his works.
019	PSA	063	001	“A psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.” O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry land, and it is faint without water.
019	PSA	063	002	As I have beheld thee in the sanctuary, seeing thy strength and thy glory;
019	PSA	063	003	Because thy kindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee:
019	PSA	063	004	Thus will I bless thee while I live; in thy name will I lift up my hands.
019	PSA	063	005	As with fat and marrow will my soul be satisfied; and with tuneful lips shall my mouth praise thee.
019	PSA	063	006	When I remember thee upon my couch, I meditate on thee in the night-watches.
019	PSA	063	007	Because thou hast been a help unto me; and in the shadow of thy wings will I sing rejoicingly.
019	PSA	063	008	My soul cleaveth unto following thee: me thy right hand upholdeth.
019	PSA	063	009	But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go down into the lowest deeps of the earth.
019	PSA	063	010	They shall be delivered up to the power of the sword: they shall become a prey for jackals.
019	PSA	063	011	But the king shall rejoice in God: every one that sweareth by him shall glorify himself; for the mouth of those that speak falsehood shall be stopped.
019	PSA	064	001	“To the chief musician, a psalm of David.” Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint: preserve my life from the dread of the enemy.
019	PSA	064	002	Hide me from the secret counsel of evil-doers, from the tumultuous assault of the workers of wickedness;
019	PSA	064	003	Who whet their tongue like a sword, who aim with their arrow, the bitter word:
019	PSA	064	004	To shoot in secret at the innocent; suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.
019	PSA	064	005	They encourage themselves in an evil plan; they tell secretly of laying snares: they say, Who will see them?
019	PSA	064	006	They search out iniquities; “We are ready with the carefully searched out device:” and the inward thought and heart of each is deeply [hidden].
019	PSA	064	007	But God shooteth at them suddenly [his] arrow; —[thence] are come their wounds.
019	PSA	064	008	And their own tongues will stumble over themselves: all that look on them will shake their head.
019	PSA	064	009	All men shall fear, and shall declare the deeds of God, and understand his works.
019	PSA	064	010	The righteous shall rejoice in the Lord, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glorify themselves.
019	PSA	065	001	“To the chief musician, a psalm [and] song of David.” For thee praise is waiting, O God, in Zion: and unto thee shall vows be paid.
019	PSA	065	002	O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee all flesh shall come.
019	PSA	065	003	The iniquitous things have become too mighty for me: our transgressions—these wilt thou wipe away.
019	PSA	065	004	Happy is he whom thou choosest, and causest to approach, that he may dwell in thy courts: let us be satisfied with the happiness of thy house, the holiness of thy temple.
019	PSA	065	005	With terrific deeds in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our salvation, who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of the sea, that are far away;
019	PSA	065	006	Who setteth firmly the mountains by his power, who is girded with might;
019	PSA	065	007	Who assuageth the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves, and the tumult of nations.
019	PSA	065	008	And they that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid of thy wondrous signs: the outgoings of the morning and evening thou causest to rejoice.
019	PSA	065	009	Thou hast thought of the earth, and waterest her abundantly; thou greatly enrichest her; the brook of God is full of water: thou preparest their corn, when thou hast thus prepared her.
019	PSA	065	010	Watering her furrows abundantly, smoothing down her ridges, thou softenest her with showers; thou blessest her growth.
019	PSA	065	011	Thou hast crowned the year of thy goodness; and thy tracks drop fatness:
019	PSA	065	012	The pastures of the wilderness are dropping [with plenty]: and the hills are girt with gladness.
019	PSA	065	013	The meadows are clothed with flocks, and the valleys are enveloped with corn: men shout for joy, [yea,] they also sing.
019	PSA	066	001	“To the chief musician, a song or psalm.” Shout joyfully unto God, all ye lands:
019	PSA	066	002	Sing forth the glory of his name; make glorious his praise.
019	PSA	066	003	Say unto God, How fear-inspiring is every one of thy works! through the greatness of thy strength will thy enemies yield feigned obedience unto thee.
019	PSA	066	004	All the lands shall bow themselves down unto thee, and shall sing praises unto thee; they shall sing praises to thy name. (Selah)
019	PSA	066	005	Come and see the deeds of God: fear-inspiring is his doing toward the children of men.
019	PSA	066	006	He changed the sea into dry land: through the river they went on foot: there did we rejoice in him.
019	PSA	066	007	He ruleth by his might for ever; his eyes look upon the nations: the rebellious—these shall not be exalted. (Selah)
019	PSA	066	008	Bless, O ye people, our God, and cause the voice of his praise to be heard:
019	PSA	066	009	Who hath appointed our soul to life, and hath not suffered our foot to slip.
019	PSA	066	010	For thou hast proved us, O God: thou hast refined us, as silver is refined.
019	PSA	066	011	Thou hast brought us into the net; thou hast placed fetters upon our loins.
019	PSA	066	012	Thou hast caused men to ride on our head: we entered into fire and into water; but thou broughtest us out to [the enjoyment] of overflowing plenty. a
019	PSA	066	013	I will enter thy house with burnt-offerings: I will pay unto thee my vows,
019	PSA	066	014	Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in distress.
019	PSA	066	015	Burnt-offerings of fatlings will I offer up unto thee, with the incense of rams; I will prepare steers with he-goats. (Selah)
019	PSA	066	016	Come, hear, and I will relate, all ye that fear God, what he hath done for my soul.
019	PSA	066	017	Unto him I cried with my mouth, and a song of extolling was on my tongue.
019	PSA	066	018	If I had looked on wickedness with my heart, the Lord would not have heard;
019	PSA	066	019	But verily God hath heard; he hath listened to the voice of my prayer.
019	PSA	066	020	Blessed be God, who hath not removed my prayer [from him], nor his kindness from me.
019	PSA	067	001	“To the chief musician on Neginoth, a psalm or song.” May God be gracious unto us, and bless us; may he cause his face to shine upon us. (Selah)
019	PSA	067	002	That upon earth men may know thy way, among all nations thy salvation.
019	PSA	067	003	The people will thank thee, O God; the people, all of them together, will thank thee.
019	PSA	067	004	Nations will rejoice and sing for joy: when thou judgest the people righteously, and guidest the nations upon earth. (Selah)
019	PSA	067	005	The people will thank thee, O God; the people, all of them together, will thank thee.
019	PSA	067	006	The earth yieldeth her products: [yea,] God, our own God, bless us.
019	PSA	067	007	God will bless us: and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.
019	PSA	068	001	“To the chief musician, by David, a Psalm or song.” Oh that God would arise, that his enemies might be scattered, and those that hate him might flee before him.
019	PSA	068	002	As smoke is driven off, so drive them away: as wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.
019	PSA	068	003	But the righteous shall rejoice; they shall exult before God: yea, they shall be exceedingly joyful.
019	PSA	068	004	Sing unto God, sing praises to his name; extol him who rideth upon the heavens: the Everlasting is his name, and rejoice before him.
019	PSA	068	005	A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in his holy habitation.
019	PSA	068	006	God places those who are solitary in the midst of their families: he bringeth out those who are bound unto happiness; but the rebellious dwell in a dry land.
019	PSA	068	007	O God, when thou didst go forth before thy people, when thou didst tread along through the wilderness—Selah—
019	PSA	068	008	The earth quaked, also the heavens dropped at the presence of God, yea, this Sinai, at the presence of God, the God of Israel.
019	PSA	068	009	Rain of beneficence didst thou pour down, O God, whereby thou didst truly strengthen thy heritage, when it was weary.
019	PSA	068	010	Thy assembly dwelt therein: thou didst prepare it with thy goodness for the afflicted [people]. O God,
019	PSA	068	011	The Lord gave [happy] tidings; they are published by the female messengers, a numerous host.
019	PSA	068	012	The kings of the armies flee away—flee away: yet she that tarried at home divideth the spoil.
019	PSA	068	013	When ye lie still between the folds [of your cattle], [ye will be like] the wings of the dove covered with sliver, and her pinions shining with flaming gold.
019	PSA	068	014	When the Almighty scattered kings in the midst of her, then even in darkness shone light [as pure] as snow.
019	PSA	068	015	A mountain of God is the mount of Bashan; many peaks hath the mount of Bashan.
019	PSA	068	016	Why watch ye enviously, ye many-peaked mountains, yonder mountain which God hath chosen for his residence? yea, the Lord will also dwell [there] for ever.
019	PSA	068	017	The chariots of God are two myriads; thousands of angels [follow him]: the Lord is among them: so is Sinai holy [among mountains].
019	PSA	068	018	Thou didst ascend on high, lead away captives, receive gifts among men, yea, even the rebellious, to dwell among them. O Lord God.
019	PSA	068	019	Blessed be the Lord; day by day he loadeth us [with benefits]; our God is our salvation. (Selah)
019	PSA	068	020	Our God is to us the God of salvation: and by the Eternal the Lord are the escapes from death.
019	PSA	068	021	But God will crush the head of his enemies, the hairy skull of him who walketh in his guiltiness.
019	PSA	068	022	The Lord hath said, From Bashan will I bring back, I will bring back from the depths of the sea:
019	PSA	068	023	In order that thou mayest wade with thy feet in blood, feeding the tongue of thy dogs from the enemies' blood.
019	PSA	068	024	Men see thy goings forth, O God! the goings forth of my God, my King, into the sanctuary.
019	PSA	068	025	First come singers, then follow players on instruments, in the midst of maidens playing on timbrels.
019	PSA	068	026	In assemblies bless ye God, [praise] the Lord, ye sprung from Israel's fountain.
019	PSA	068	027	There Benjamin the youngest leadeth them on, the princes of Judah in purple robes, the princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali.
019	PSA	068	028	Thy God hath ordained the rule to thee: strengthen, O God, what thou hast wrought for us.
019	PSA	068	029	Because of thy temple over Jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto thee.
019	PSA	068	030	Rebuke the wild beasts hiding among the reeds, the troops of steers among the calves of nations, that hasten along with presents of silver. He scattereth nations that are eager for the fight.
019	PSA	068	031	Nobles will come out of Egypt: Ethiopia will stretch forth eagerly her hands unto God.
019	PSA	068	032	Kingdoms of the earth, sing unto God; sing praises unto the Lord: (Selah)
019	PSA	068	033	To him who rideth over the highest heavens, of ancient days: hear! he sendeth forth his voice, the voice of might.
019	PSA	068	034	Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency is over Israel, and his strength is in the skies.
019	PSA	068	035	Thou art tremendous, O God, from thy holy residences: O God of Israel, [thou art] he that givest strength and power unto [thy] people. Blessed be God.
019	PSA	069	001	“To the chief musician upon Shoshannim, by David.” Save me, O God; for the waters are come even to threaten my life.
019	PSA	069	002	I am sunk in the mire of the deep, where there is no standing; I am come into the depths of the waters, and the flood overfloweth me.
019	PSA	069	003	I am weary of my calling; my throat is hoarse; my eyes fail, while I hope for my God.
019	PSA	069	004	More than the hairs of my head are those that hate me without a cause; numerous are those that would destroy me, that are my enemies wrongfully: what I have not robbed shall I now restore.
019	PSA	069	005	O God, thou art well aware of my folly, and my guilty deeds are from thee not hidden.
019	PSA	069	006	Let not those that wait on thee, O Lord Eternal of hosts, be made ashamed through me: let not those that seek thee be confounded through me, O God of Israel.
019	PSA	069	007	Because for thy sake have I borne reproach, hath confusion covered my face.
019	PSA	069	008	A stranger am I become unto my brothers, and an alien unto my mother's children.
019	PSA	069	009	Because the zeal for thy house hath devoured me; and the reproaches of those that reproached thee are fallen upon me.
019	PSA	069	010	When I wept at the fasting of my soul, it became a reproach to me.
019	PSA	069	011	And when I made sackcloth my garment, I became a proverb to them.
019	PSA	069	012	Those that sit in the gate talk against me; and [about me make] songs the drinkers of strong drink.
019	PSA	069	013	But as for me, I direct my prayer unto thee, O Lord, in a time of favor; O God, in the multitude of thy kindness: answer me in the truth of thy salvation.
019	PSA	069	014	Deliver me out of the mire, that I may not sink: let me be delivered from those that hate me, and out of the depths of the waters.
019	PSA	069	015	Let not the flood of waters overflow me, and let not the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit close its mouth upon me.
019	PSA	069	016	Answer me, O Lord; for thy kindness is good: according to the multitude of thy mercies turn thou unto me.
019	PSA	069	017	And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in distress: make haste and answer me.
019	PSA	069	018	Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: because of my enemies do thou ransom me.
019	PSA	069	019	Thou well knowest my reproach, and my shame, and my confusion: before thee are all my assailants.
019	PSA	069	020	Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am sick; and I waited for pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.
019	PSA	069	021	And they put into my food gall; and in my thirst they give me vinegar to drink.
019	PSA	069	022	May [then] their table become a snare before them: and to those that are at peace, a trap.
019	PSA	069	023	May their eyes become dark, that they cannot see; and make their loins continually to waver.
019	PSA	069	024	Pour out over them thy indignation, and let the heat of thy anger overtake them.
019	PSA	069	025	May their palace become desolate: in their tents let no one dwell.
019	PSA	069	026	For whom thou hast smitten they persecute; and of the pain of those whom thou but wounded do they converse.
019	PSA	069	027	Lay guilt upon their guilt; and let them not come into thy righteousness.
019	PSA	069	028	Let them be blotted out of the book of the living; and with the righteous let them not be written down.
019	PSA	069	029	But I am poor and suffering: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.
019	PSA	069	030	I will praise the name of God with song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.
019	PSA	069	031	And this will please the Lord better than an ox or bullock having horns and cloven hoofs.
019	PSA	069	032	The meek will see this, and be rejoiced: ye that seek God, and your heart shall revive.
019	PSA	069	033	For the Lord listeneth unto the needy, and his prisoners he despiseth not.
019	PSA	069	034	Let heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.
019	PSA	069	035	For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may abide there, and have it in possession:
019	PSA	069	036	And the seed of his servants shall inherit it; and they that love his name shall dwell therein.
019	PSA	070	001	“To the chief musician, by David, to bring to remembrance.” O God, [arise] to deliver me; O Lord, make haste to help me.
019	PSA	070	002	Let those that seek after my life be made ashamed and put to the blush: let those that desire my unhappiness be turned backward and put to confusion.
019	PSA	070	003	Let them be turned backward in consequence of their shame, that say, Aha, aha.
019	PSA	070	004	Let all those that seek thee be glad and rejoice in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say continually, God is great.
019	PSA	070	005	But I am poor and needy, O God: come hastily unto me; my help and my deliverer art thou: O Lord, do not delay.
019	PSA	071	001	In thee, O Lord, do I put my trust; let me never be made ashamed.
019	PSA	071	002	In thy righteousness do thou deliver me and release me: incline thy ear unto me, and save me.
019	PSA	071	003	Be thou unto me a rocky habitation, whereunto I may continually resort, which thou hast ordained to save me; for my rock and my strong-hold art thou.
019	PSA	071	004	O my God, release me out of the hand of the wicked, out of the grasp of the unrighteous and violent man.
019	PSA	071	005	For thou art my hope, O Lord Eternal: thou art my trust from my youth.
019	PSA	071	006	By thee have I been supported from my birth: thou art he that took me out of my mother's womb: of thee is my praise continually.
019	PSA	071	007	As a wonderful token have I been unto many; but thou art my strong refuge.
019	PSA	071	008	My mouth shall be filled with thy praise, and with thy glory all the day.
019	PSA	071	009	Cast me not off in the time of old age: when my strength faileth, forsake me not.
019	PSA	071	010	For my enemies speak of me; and they that watch for my soul take counsel together,
019	PSA	071	011	Saying, “God hath forsaken him: pursue and seize him: for there is none to deliver.”
019	PSA	071	012	O God, be not far from me: O my God, hasten to my help.
019	PSA	071	013	Let those be made ashamed, let them perish, that are adversaries to my soul: let those be covered with reproach and dishonor that seek my unhappiness.
019	PSA	071	014	But I will continually hope, and will add yet more to all thy praise.
019	PSA	071	015	My mouth shall relate thy righteousness, all the day thy salvation; for I know not their numbers.
019	PSA	071	016	I will come to praise the mighty deeds of the Lord Eternal: I will make mention of thy righteousness, yea, thine only.
019	PSA	071	017	O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto I ever tell of thy wondrous deeds.
019	PSA	071	018	Therefore also even in old age, and when I am grayheaded, O God, forsake me not: until I have told of thy strength unto [this] generation, to every one that may come of thy might.
019	PSA	071	019	And thy righteousness, O God, reacheth even to the height, thou, who hast done great things: O God, who is like thee!
019	PSA	071	020	Thou, who hast shown me great distresses and misfortunes, wilt again revive me; and from the depths of the earth wilt thou bring me up again.
019	PSA	071	021	Thou wilt increase my greatness, and wilt turn round and comfort me.
019	PSA	071	022	Also I, I will thank thee with the psaltery, [for] thy truth, O my God: I will sing unto thee with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.
019	PSA	071	023	My lips shall shout joyfully when I sing unto thee; and my soul [too], which thou hast redeemed.
019	PSA	071	024	Also my tongue shall speak all the day of thy righteousness; for ashamed, for put to the blush are those that seek my unhappiness.
019	PSA	072	001	“By Solomon.” O God, give unto the king thy decisions, and thy righteousness unto the king's son.
019	PSA	072	002	He shall decide for thy people with righteousness, and for thy afflicted with justice.
019	PSA	072	003	The mountains shall bear peace for the people, and the hills [the same], through righteousness.
019	PSA	072	004	He shall judge the afflicted of the people, he shall give help to the children of the needy; but he shall crush the oppressor.
019	PSA	072	005	They shall fear thee as long as the sun shineth, and in the presence of the moon, throughout all generations.
019	PSA	072	006	He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass, as showers which are dropping on the earth.
019	PSA	072	007	In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace [shall be] till the moon shall be no more.
019	PSA	072	008	And he shall have dominion from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.
019	PSA	072	009	Before him shall bend down those that dwell in the wilderness; and his enemies shall lick the dust.
019	PSA	072	010	The kings of Tharshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.
019	PSA	072	011	Yea, there shall bow down before him all kings: all nations shall serve him.
019	PSA	072	012	For he will deliver the needy when he crieth; the afflicted also, who hath no helper.
019	PSA	072	013	He will spare the poor and needy; and the souls of the needy will he assist.
019	PSA	072	014	From wrong and violence will he deliver their soul; and precious shall their blood be in his eyes.
019	PSA	072	015	And he shall live; and he will give him of the gold of Sheba: and he will pray in his behalf continually; all the time will he bless him.
019	PSA	072	016	There shall be an abundance of corn in the land; upon the top of the mountains its fruit shall shake like [the trees of] Lebanon; and [men] shall blossom out of the city like herbs of the earth.
019	PSA	072	017	His name will endure for ever; in the presence of the sun his name shall flourish: and men shall bless themselves with him: all nations shall call him happy.
019	PSA	072	018	Blessed be the Lord the God, the God of Israel, who alone doth wondrous things.
019	PSA	072	019	And blessed he his glorious name for ever; and with his glory may the whole earth be filled: Amen, and Amen.
019	PSA	072	020	Here are ended the prayers of David the son of Jesse.
019	PSA	073	001	BOOK THIRD: “A Psalm of Assaph.” Truly God is good to Israel, to such as are pure of heart.
019	PSA	073	002	But as for me, it lacked but little that my feet had been moved: almost nothing was needed that my steps had slipped.
019	PSA	073	003	For I was envious at the arrogant, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
019	PSA	073	004	For there are no deadly fetters for them, but their strength is firm.
019	PSA	073	005	They share not in the trouble of mortals, and with men are they not afflicted.
019	PSA	073	006	Therefore is pride their neck-chain: violence envelopeth them as a garment.
019	PSA	073	007	Their eyes start out from fatness: they have exceeded their heart's imaginings.
019	PSA	073	008	They scorn, and speak wickedly of oppression: loftily do they speak.
019	PSA	073	009	They set their mouth in the heavens, and their tongue walketh busily on the earth.
019	PSA	073	010	Therefore do his people turn away hither: and waters of a full cup are drained by them.
019	PSA	073	011	And they say, How should God know? and is there knowledge in the Most High?
019	PSA	073	012	Behold, these are the wicked; and yet prospering continually they increase in wealth.
019	PSA	073	013	Verily in vain have I thus cleansed my heart, and have washed in innocency my hands:
019	PSA	073	014	While I was afflicted all the day, and my chastisement [came] every morning.
019	PSA	073	015	But if I were to say, I will speak thus: behold, I would be treacherous against the generation of thy children.
019	PSA	073	016	And when I should think to know this, it would be trouble in my eyes;
019	PSA	073	017	Until I enter into the sanctuary of God; and understand what their future will be.
019	PSA	073	018	Surely thou placest them on slippery spots: thou lettest them fall down into destruction.
019	PSA	073	019	How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they perish, they come to their end with terrific events.
019	PSA	073	020	As a dream after awaking, O Lord, reject thou in wrath their image.
019	PSA	073	021	For it fermented in my heart, and in my reins I felt sharp thrusts;
019	PSA	073	022	But I was indeed foolish, and I knew it not: I was as a [thoughtless] beast with thee.
019	PSA	073	023	Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast seized hold of me by my right hand.
019	PSA	073	024	With thy counsel wilt thou guide me, and afterward take me on to glory.
019	PSA	073	025	Whom have I in heaven? and beside thee I desire nothing upon earth.
019	PSA	073	026	Though my flesh and my heart should fall; yet the rock of my heart, and my portion will be God for ever.
019	PSA	073	027	For, lo, those that are far from thee shall perish: thou destroyest every one that strayeth away from thee.
019	PSA	073	028	But as regardeth me, to draw near to God is good for me: I have put in the Lord Eternal my trust, that I may relate all thy works.
019	PSA	074	001	“A Maskil of Assaph.” Why, O God, hast thou cast us off for ever? why will thy anger smoke against the flock of thy pasture?
019	PSA	074	002	Remember thy congregation, which thou didst acquire of old; which thou didst redeem as the tribe of thy inheritance: this mount Zion, whereon thou hast dwelt.
019	PSA	074	003	Lift up thy steps unto the perpetual heaps of ruins: the enemy hath ill-used every thing in the sanctuary.
019	PSA	074	004	Thy adversaries have roared in the midst of thy places of assembly: they have set up their signs for signs.
019	PSA	074	005	[The enemy] is known as one that lifteth up high axes against the thickets of a forest.
019	PSA	074	006	And now they hew in pieces the carved work thereof altogether with hatchets and hammers.
019	PSA	074	007	They have set on fire thy sanctuary; to the ground have they profaned the dwelling-place of thy name.
019	PSA	074	008	They have said in their heart, We will oppress them altogether: they have burnt up all the places of assembly of God in the land.
019	PSA	074	009	Our signs do we not see: there is no more any prophet: and there is no one among us that knoweth how long.
019	PSA	074	010	How long, O God, shall the adversary utter defiance? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?
019	PSA	074	011	Why withdrawest thou thy hand, and thy right hand? [draw it] out of thy bosom—exterminate [them];
019	PSA	074	012	Since [thou] God art my King from olden days, working salvation in the midst of the earth.
019	PSA	074	013	It was thou that didst divide by thy strength the sea: thou brokest in pieces the heads of the crocodiles on the waters.
019	PSA	074	014	Thou didst crush the heads of leviathan, and gavest them as food to the people inhabiting the wilderness.
019	PSA	074	015	Thou didst cleave fountain and stream: thou didst dry up ever-flowing rivers.
019	PSA	074	016	Thine is the day and thine is the night: it is thou who hast prepared the luminary and the sun.
019	PSA	074	017	It is thou who hast set up all the boundaries of the earth: summer and winter—thou thyself hast formed them.
019	PSA	074	018	Remember this, that the enemy hath defied the Lord, and that a worthless foolish people have blasphemed thy name.
019	PSA	074	019	Oh give not up unto the multitude of enemies the soul of thy turtle-dove: the congregation of thy afflicted do not thou forget for ever.
019	PSA	074	020	Look unto the covenant; for the dark places of the earth are full of habitations of violence.
019	PSA	074	021	Oh let not the oppressed return confounded: let the poor and needy praise thy name.
019	PSA	074	022	Arise, O God, plead thy own cause: remember thy defiance from the worthless fool all the day.
019	PSA	074	023	Forget not the voice of thy adversaries: the tumult of those that rise up against thee ascendeth continually.
019	PSA	075	001	“To the chief musician, Al-tashcheth, a psalm or song of Asaph.” We give thanks unto thee, O God, we give thanks, and nigh is thy name: men relate thy wondrous deeds.
019	PSA	075	002	“For I will take up a fixed time when I will judge uprightly.
019	PSA	075	003	The earth and all her inhabitants are melting away: I myself establish firmly her pillars.” (Selah)
019	PSA	075	004	I said unto the arrogant, Deal not arrogantly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn.
019	PSA	075	005	Lift not up on high your horn, speak not with a stiffly erect neck.
019	PSA	075	006	For neither from the rising [of the sun], nor from [his] setting, nor from the wilderness of mountains [cometh this];
019	PSA	075	007	But God is the judge: he lowereth one, and lifteth up another,
019	PSA	075	008	For there is a cup in the hand of the Lord, and the wine foameth, it is full of mixture: and he poureth out of the same; but its lees they drain, they drink—all the wicked of the earth.
019	PSA	075	009	But I will declare for ever, I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
019	PSA	075	010	And all the horns of the wicked will I hew off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.
019	PSA	076	001	“To the chief musician on Neginoth, a psalm or song of Assaph.” In Judah hath God been made known: in Israel is his name great.
019	PSA	076	002	And in Salem was his tabernacle made, and his dwelling-place in Zion.
019	PSA	076	003	There broke he the shining arrows of the bow, shield, and sword, and battle. (Selah)
019	PSA	076	004	Thou art more brilliant, more excellent than the mountains [full] of prey.
019	PSA	076	005	Bereft of reason are the stouthearted, they slumber their sleep: and none of the men of might have found [the use of] their hands.
019	PSA	076	006	From thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, lie in deep sleep both chariot and horse.
019	PSA	076	007	Thou—thou art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thy anger [is kindled]?
019	PSA	076	008	From heaven hast thou caused [thy] sentence to be heard: the earth feared, and became still,
019	PSA	076	009	When God rose to judgment, to save all the lowly of the earth. (Selah)
019	PSA	076	010	For the fury of man shall praise thee: the remainder of the fury wilt thou gird about thee.
019	PSA	076	011	Make vows, and pay [them] unto the Lord your God, all ye that are round about him: let men bring presents unto him that exciteth fear.
019	PSA	076	012	He will cut down the spirit of the powerful: he is terrible to the kings of the earth.
019	PSA	077	001	“To the chief musician on Jeduthun, by Assaph a psalm.” [I lift up] my voice unto God, and I cry; [I lilt up] my voice unto God: do then give ear unto me.
019	PSA	077	002	On the day of my distress I sought the Lord; in the night my hand was stretched out, and did not cease: my soul refused to be comforted.
019	PSA	077	003	I think of God, and moan: I reflect, and my spirit is overwhelmed. (Selah)
019	PSA	077	004	Thou holdest my eyes awake: I am troubled and I cannot speak.
019	PSA	077	005	I think over the days of old, the years of ancient times.
019	PSA	077	006	I call to remembrance my song in the night; with my own heart I reflect: and my spirit maketh diligent search.
019	PSA	077	007	Will the Lord cast me off for ever? and will he never more give his favor again?
019	PSA	077	008	Is his kindness spent for ever? is his promise come to an end for all generations?
019	PSA	077	009	Hath God forgotten to be gracious? or hath he shut up in anger his mercies? (Selah)
019	PSA	077	010	And I said, This shall be my entreaty, [for] the years of the right hand of the Most High.
019	PSA	077	011	I will remember the deeds of the Lord; for I will remember out of ancient times thy wonders.
019	PSA	077	012	I will meditate also of all thy work, and on thy deeds will I reflect.
019	PSA	077	013	O God, in holiness is thy way: where is there a god so great as God?
019	PSA	077	014	Thou art the God that dost wonders: thou hast made known among the people thy strength.
019	PSA	077	015	Thou hast redeemed with [a mighty] arm thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. (Selah)
019	PSA	077	016	The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they shook: also the depths trembled.
019	PSA	077	017	The clouds poured out water; the skies sent forth thunder: also thy arrows sped along.
019	PSA	077	018	The voice of thy thunder was in the whirlwind; lightnings gave light to the world; the earth trembled and quaked,
019	PSA	077	019	Through the sea led thy way, and thy path was through mighty waters, and thy footsteps could not be known.
019	PSA	077	020	Thou didst lead like a flock thy people by means of Moses and Aaron.
019	PSA	078	001	“A Maskil of Assaph.” Give ear, O my people, to my instruction: incline thy ear to the words of my mouth.
019	PSA	078	002	I will open with a parable my mouth: I will utter riddles out of ancient times;
019	PSA	078	003	Which we have heard and know, and which our fathers have related unto us.
019	PSA	078	004	We will not conceal them from their children, relating to the latest generation the praises of the Lord, and his strength, and his wonderful deeds which he hath done.
019	PSA	078	005	Yea, he established a testimony in Jacob, and instituted a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:
019	PSA	078	006	In order that the latest generation might know them, even the children that are to be born; that they may arise and relate them to their children;
019	PSA	078	007	That they may place in God their hope, and not forget the doings of God, but observe his commandments;
019	PSA	078	008	And that they may not be like their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that had not directed their heart firmly, and whose spirit was not faithful to God.
019	PSA	078	009	The children of Ephraim, like well-armed archers, that turn round on the day of battle,
019	PSA	078	010	Kept not the covenant of God, and in his law they refused to walk;
019	PSA	078	011	And they forgot his deeds, as also his wonders, which he had permitted them to see.
019	PSA	078	012	In the presence of their fathers did he do wonders, in the land of Egypt, in the fields of Zo'an.
019	PSA	078	013	He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters stand upright as a wall.
019	PSA	078	014	And he led them with the cloud by day, and all the night with a light of fire.
019	PSA	078	015	He split rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the mighty deep.
019	PSA	078	016	And he brought forth running streams out of the rock, and caused water to run down like rivers.
019	PSA	078	017	But they repeated to sin yet more against him, rebelling against the Most High in the desert.
019	PSA	078	018	And they tempted God in their heart, by asking food for their desire.
019	PSA	078	019	Yea, they spoke against God: they said, Will God be able to set in order a table in the wilderness?
019	PSA	078	020	Behold, he smote the rock, so that waters gushed out, and streams overflowed: shall he also be able to give bread? or can he provide flesh for his people?
019	PSA	078	021	Therefore, when the Lord heard this, he became wroth: and a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also ascended against Israel,
019	PSA	078	022	Because they had not believed in God, and had not trusted in his salvation.
019	PSA	078	023	Then he ordained the skies from above, and the doors of heaven he opened;
019	PSA	078	024	And he let rain down upon them manna to eat, and the corn of heaven gave he unto them.
019	PSA	078	025	Angels' bread did man eat: he sent them provision to satisfaction.
019	PSA	078	026	He caused an east wind to pass along the heavens; and he led forth by his strength the south wind.
019	PSA	078	027	And he let rain upon them flesh [as plentiful] as the dust, and winged birds like the sand of the sea;
019	PSA	078	028	And he let them fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.
019	PSA	078	029	And they ate, and were greatly satisfied, and what they longed for he brought unto them.
019	PSA	078	030	They were not estranged from their longing, yet was their food in their mouth:
019	PSA	078	031	When the wrath of God ascended against them, and he slew some of the fattest of them, and the young men of Israel did he strike down.
019	PSA	078	032	With all this they sinned again, and believed not in his wonders.
019	PSA	078	033	Therefore he caused their days to come to an end in nought, and their years in dread.
019	PSA	078	034	When he slew them, then did they seek him, and they returned and inquired earnestly after God.
019	PSA	078	035	And they remembered that God was their rock, and the most high God their redeemer.
019	PSA	078	036	Nevertheless they prayed insincerely to him with their mouth, and with their tongue they lied unto him.
019	PSA	078	037	For their heart was not firm with him, and they were not faithful in his covenant.
019	PSA	078	038	But he, being merciful, forgave the iniquity, and destroyed [them] not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not awaken all his fury.
019	PSA	078	039	And he remembered that they are but flesh, a spirit that passeth away, and returneth not again.
019	PSA	078	040	How oft did they rebel against him in the wilderness, grieve him in the desert!
019	PSA	078	041	Yea, they once more tempted God, and set limits to the Holy One of Israel.
019	PSA	078	042	They remembered not his hand, the day when he ransomed them from the adversary;
019	PSA	078	043	When he displayed in Egypt his signs, and his wonderful tokens in the fields of Zo'an.
019	PSA	078	044	And he changed their rivers into blood; and their running streams, that they could not drink [of them].
019	PSA	078	045	He sent out among them various wild beasts, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.
019	PSA	078	046	And he gave unto the cricket their products, and their labor unto the locust.
019	PSA	078	047	He slew with hail their vines, and their sycamore-trees with ice-bolts.
019	PSA	078	048	And he surrendered to the hail their cattle, and their herds to the lightning's flashes.
019	PSA	078	049	He let loose against them the fierceness of his anger, wrath and indignation, and distress, a host of angels of misfortune.
019	PSA	078	050	He leveled a path for his anger; he withheld not from death their soul, and their life he surrendered to the pestilence;
019	PSA	078	051	And he smote all the first-born in Egypt; the first of their strength in the tents of Ham;
019	PSA	078	052	But he caused his own people to depart like flocks, and guided them like a drove in the wilderness.
019	PSA	078	053	And he led them in safety, so that they felt no dread; but the sea covered over their enemies.
019	PSA	078	054	And he brought them to his holy territory, even to this mount, which his right hand had acquired.
019	PSA	078	055	And he drove out from before them nations, and divided them by the measuring-line as an inheritance, and he caused to dwell in their tents the tribes of Israel.
019	PSA	078	056	Yet they tempted and rebelled against the most high God, and his testimonies they kept not;
019	PSA	078	057	But swerved aside, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers; they turned about like a deceitful bow.
019	PSA	078	058	And they provoked him to anger with their high-places, and with their graven images they moved him to jealousy.
019	PSA	078	059	God heard this, and he became wroth, and felt greatly disgusted with Israel;
019	PSA	078	060	And he cast off the dwelling at Shiloh, the tabernacle where he had dwelt among men;
019	PSA	078	061	And he gave up his strength unto captivity, and his glory into the adversary's hand.
019	PSA	078	062	And he surrendered his people unto the sword; and with his inheritance was he wroth.
019	PSA	078	063	His young men the fire devoured; and his virgins were not demanded in marriage.
019	PSA	078	064	His priests fell by the sword; and his widows did not weep.
019	PSA	078	065	Then awoke the Lord as one that sleepeth, like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.
019	PSA	078	066	And he smote his enemies backward: a perpetual disgrace on them.
019	PSA	078	067	Yet was he disgusted with the tent of Joseph, and of the tribe of Ephraim he made not choice;
019	PSA	078	068	But he chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.
019	PSA	078	069	And he built like high [mountains] his sanctuary, like the earth which he hath founded for ever.
019	PSA	078	070	And he made choice of David his servant, and took him from the sheep-folds:
019	PSA	078	071	From following the ewes with young he brought him, to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
019	PSA	078	072	And he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and by the skilfulness of his hands did he lead them.
019	PSA	079	001	“A psalm of Assaph.” O God! nations have entered into thy heritage; they have profaned thy holy temple; they have rendered Jerusalem heaps of ruins.
019	PSA	079	002	They have given the dead bodies of thy servants as food unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy pious ones unto the beasts of the earth.
019	PSA	079	003	They have shed their blood like water all round about Jerusalem: and there is no one to bury them.
019	PSA	079	004	We are become a reproach to our neighbors, a scorn and derision to those that are round about us.
019	PSA	079	005	How long, Lord? wilt thou be indignant for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire?
019	PSA	079	006	Pour out thy fury over the nations that acknowledge thee not, and over the kingdoms that have not called on thy name.
019	PSA	079	007	For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling-place.
019	PSA	079	008	Oh remember not against us the iniquities of our fathers: make haste, let thy mercies come to our aid; for we are very miserable.
019	PSA	079	009	Help us, O God of our salvation, because of the glory of thy name; and deliver us, and atone for our sins, for the sake of thy name.
019	PSA	079	010	Wherefore shall the nations say, Where is their God? let there be made known among the nations before our eyes, the vengeance for the blood of thy servants which hath been shed.
019	PSA	079	011	Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee: according to the greatness of thy almighty power preserve thou those that are doomed to death;
019	PSA	079	012	And recompense unto our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom their defiance wherewith they have defied thee, O Lord.
019	PSA	079	013	But we thy people and the flock of thy pasture will give thanks unto thee for ever: from generation to generation will we relate thy praise.
019	PSA	080	001	“To the chief musician upon Shoshannim; an 'Eduth by Assaph; a psalm.” O Shepherd of Israel, give ear, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth.
019	PSA	080	002	Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Menasseh awaken thy might, and come to our help.
019	PSA	080	003	O God, cause us to return, and let thy countenance shine, that we may be saved.
019	PSA	080	004	O Lord of hosts, how long shall thy anger smoke against the prayer of thy people?
019	PSA	080	005	Thou feedest them with the bread of tears, and givest them tears to drink in great measure.
019	PSA	080	006	Thou renderest us a contest unto our neighbors: and our enemies hold derision among themselves.
019	PSA	080	007	O God of hosts, cause us to return, and let thy countenance shine, that we may be saved.
019	PSA	080	008	A vine didst thou remove out of Egypt: thou drovest out nations, and plantedst it.
019	PSA	080	009	Thou didst clear out a place before it, and it struck its root deeply, and it filled the land.
019	PSA	080	010	Mountains were covered with its shadow, and with its boughs the cedars of God.
019	PSA	080	011	It sent out its tendrils as far as the sea, and unto the river its suckers.
019	PSA	080	012	Wherefore hast thou now broken down its fences, so that all who pass by the way pluck the fruit from it?
019	PSA	080	013	The boar out of the forest doth gnaw at it, and what moveth on the field feedeth on it.
019	PSA	080	014	O God of hosts, return; I pray thee, look down from heaven, and behold, and think of this vine;
019	PSA	080	015	And of the sprout which thy right hand hath planted, and of the branch that thou hast made strong for thyself.
019	PSA	080	016	It is burnt with fire, it is hewn down; because of the rebuke of thy countenance do they perish.
019	PSA	080	017	Let thy hand be over the man of thy right hand, over the son of man whom thou hast made strong for thyself.
019	PSA	080	018	Then will we not swerve from thee: revive us again, and we will call on thy name.
019	PSA	080	019	O Lord God of hosts, cause us to return: let thy countenance shine, that we may be saved.
019	PSA	081	001	“To the chief musician upon Gittith; by Assaph.” Sing aloud unto God our strength: shout joyfully unto the God of Jacob.
019	PSA	081	002	Lift up psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery.
019	PSA	081	003	Blow on the new moon the cornet, at the time appointed, on the day of our feast.
019	PSA	081	004	For this is a statute for Israel, an ordinance by the God of Jacob.
019	PSA	081	005	As a testimony in Joseph did he ordain it, when he went out over the land of Egypt. The language of one I had not known did I hear.
019	PSA	081	006	I removed from the burden his shoulder: his hands left behind the burden-basket.
019	PSA	081	007	In distress thou didst call, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret of the thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. (Selah)
019	PSA	081	008	Hear, O my people, and I will give warning unto thee; O Israel, if thou wouldst but hearken unto me!
019	PSA	081	009	There shall not be among thee a foreign God; nor shalt thou bow thyself down to any strange God.
019	PSA	081	010	I am the Lord thy God, who have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt: open wide thy mouth, and I will fill it.
019	PSA	081	011	But my people did not hearken to my voice; and Israel was not willing [to follow] me.
019	PSA	081	012	So I let them go in the stubbornness of their own hearts: and they walked in their own counsels.
019	PSA	081	013	Oh that my people would hearken unto me, that Israel would walk in my ways!
019	PSA	081	014	In a little while would I subdue their enemies, and against their adversaries would I turn my hand.
019	PSA	081	015	The haters of the Lord should offer flattery unto him; but their time should endure for ever.
019	PSA	081	016	And he would feed him with the best of wheat: and out of the rock would I satisfy thee with honey.
019	PSA	082	001	“A psalm of Assaph.” God standeth in the congregation of God, in the midst of judges doth he judge.
019	PSA	082	002	How long will ye judge unjustly, and treat with favor the face of the wicked? (Selah)
019	PSA	082	003	Judge uprightly the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and indigent.
019	PSA	082	004	Release the poor and needy: deliver them out of the power of the wicked.
019	PSA	082	005	They know not, nor will they understand; in darkness do they walk on: all the foundations of the earth are moved.
019	PSA	082	006	I have indeed said, Ye are gods; and children of the most High are all of you.
019	PSA	082	007	But verily like men shall ye die, and like one of the princes shall ye fall.
019	PSA	082	008	Arise, O God, judge the earth; for thou wilt possess all the nations.
019	PSA	083	001	“A song or psalm of Assaph.” O God, take no rest for thyself: be not silent and keep not still, O God!
019	PSA	083	002	For, lo, thy enemies make a tumult, and they that hate thee have lifted up their head.
019	PSA	083	003	Against thy people they take crafty secret device, and they consult against those whom thou protectest.
019	PSA	083	004	They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; and the name of Israel shall be remembered no more.
019	PSA	083	005	For they have consulted cordially together; against thee they make a covenant:
019	PSA	083	006	The tents of Edom, and the Ishmaelites: Moab, and the Hagarenes;
019	PSA	083	007	Gebal, and 'Ammon, and 'Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;
019	PSA	083	008	Also Asshur is joined with them; they have become an arm unto the children of Lot. (Selah)
019	PSA	083	009	Do unto them as [unto] Midian; as to Sissera, as to Jabin, at the brook Kishon:
019	PSA	083	010	Who were annihilated at 'En-dor; they became as dung for the ground.
019	PSA	083	011	Render them, their nobles, like 'Oreb, and like Zeeb; yea, like Zebach and like Zalmunna' all their princes;
019	PSA	083	012	Who said, Let us conquer for ourselves the dwellings of God,
019	PSA	083	013	O my God, render them like the thistle-down, like stubble before the wind.
019	PSA	083	014	As the fire burneth up a forest, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire:
019	PSA	083	015	So pursue them with thy storm, and with thy whirlwind do thou terrify them.
019	PSA	083	016	Fill their faces with shame, that they may seek thy name, O Lord!
019	PSA	083	017	Let them be made ashamed and terrified for ever and aye; yea, let them be put to the blush and perish:
019	PSA	083	018	That they may know that thou, whose name is the Eternal, art by thyself alone, the Most High over all the earth.
019	PSA	084	001	“To the chief musician upon Gittith, by the sons of Korach, a psalm.” How lovely are thy dwelling-places, O Lord of hosts!
019	PSA	084	002	My soul desired, yea, it also longed for the courts of the Lord: my heart and my flesh shout with joy unto the living God.
019	PSA	084	003	Even as the sparrow hath found a house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young: —[have I found] thy altars, O Lord of hosts, my King, and my God.
019	PSA	084	004	Happy are they who dwell in thy house: they will be continually praising thee. (Selah)
019	PSA	084	005	Happy is the man whose strong confidence is in thee, [all] whose heart reflecteth on the paths [of righteousness].
019	PSA	084	006	Passing through the valley of weeping, they will change it into a spring: also the early rain covereth it with blessings.
019	PSA	084	007	They go from strength to strength, each of them appeareth before God in Zion.
019	PSA	084	008	O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. (Selah)
019	PSA	084	009	[Thou,] our shield, behold, O God, and look upon the face of thy anointed.
019	PSA	084	010	For better is a day in thy courts than a thousand [elsewhere]: I would rather choose to wait at the threshold of the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.
019	PSA	084	011	For a sun and shield is the Lord God; grace and glory will the Lord give; he will not withhold any good from those that walk with integrity.
019	PSA	084	012	O Lord of hosts, happy is the man that trusteth in thee.
019	PSA	085	001	“To the chief musician, by the sons of Korach, a psalm.” Thou hast been favorable, O Lord, unto thy land: thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob.
019	PSA	085	002	Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people: thou hast covered over all their sin. (Selah)
019	PSA	085	003	Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast relinquished the fierceness of thy anger.
019	PSA	085	004	Return to us, O God of our salvation, and cause thy ill-will toward us to cease.
019	PSA	085	005	Wilt thou be wroth with us for ever? wilt thou extend thy anger from generation to generation?
019	PSA	085	006	Wilt thou not [now] revive us again, that thy people may rejoice in thee?
019	PSA	085	007	Show us thy kindness, O Lord, and grant us thy salvation.
019	PSA	085	008	I will hear what God the Lord will speak; for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his pious ones: only let them not turn again to folly.
019	PSA	085	009	Surely, nigh is his salvation unto those that fear him: that glory may dwell in our land.
019	PSA	085	010	Kindness and truth are met together: righteousness and peace kiss each other.
019	PSA	085	011	Truth will grow up out of the earth, and righteousness will look down from heaven.
019	PSA	085	012	Yea, the Lord will also give the good, and our land will yield its products.
019	PSA	085	013	Righteousness will walk firmly before him, and will make [level] the way by its steps.
019	PSA	086	001	“A prayer of David.” Incline, O Lord, thy ear, answer me; for poor and needy am I.
019	PSA	086	002	Preserve my soul; for I am pious: help thy servant, O thou my God, that trusteth in thee.
019	PSA	086	003	Be gracious unto me, O Lord; for unto thee I call all the time.
019	PSA	086	004	Cause to rejoice the soul of thy servant; for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift my soul.
019	PSA	086	005	For thou, O Lord, art good and forgiving, and abundant in kindness unto all that call on thee.
019	PSA	086	006	Give ear, O Lord, unto my prayer, and attend to the voice of my supplications.
019	PSA	086	007	On the day of my distress will I call on thee; for thou wilt answer me.
019	PSA	086	008	There is none like unto thee among the Gods, O Lord; and there is nothing like thy works.
019	PSA	086	009	All the nations whom thou hast made shall come and bow themselves down before thee, O Lord; and they shall ascribe honor unto thy name.
019	PSA	086	010	For great art thou, and doing wondrous things: thou art God by thyself alone.
019	PSA	086	011	Teach me, O Lord, thy way; I will walk firmly in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.
019	PSA	086	012	I will thank thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart, and I will honor thy name for evermore.
019	PSA	086	013	For thy kindness is great toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the grave of the lower world.
019	PSA	086	014	O God, the presumptuous are risen up against me, and the assembly of the powerful wicked have sought after my life, and have not set thee before them.
019	PSA	086	015	But thou, O Lord, art God, full of mercy, and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in kindness and truth.
019	PSA	086	016	Oh turn unto me, and be gracious unto me: give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thy handmaid.
019	PSA	086	017	Display on me a sign for good, that those who hate me may see it, and be ashamed; because thou, Lord, hast helped me, and comforted me.
019	PSA	087	001	“By the sons of Korach; a psalm or song.” It is founded by him on holy mountains.
019	PSA	087	002	The Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.
019	PSA	087	003	Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. (Selah)
019	PSA	087	004	I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon as those that know me; behold, here is Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia: “This man was born there.”
019	PSA	087	005	But of Zion will it be said, “This and that man were born in her:” and the Most High himself doth establish her.
019	PSA	087	006	The Lord will number when he writeth down nations. “This man was born there.” (Selah)
019	PSA	087	007	And the singers as well as the players on instruments shall be there: all my springs [of joy] are in thee.
019	PSA	088	001	“A song or psalm of the sons of Korach, to the chief musician upon Machalath-le'annoth, a Maskil of Heman the Ezrachite.” O Lord the God of my salvation, by day do I cry, [and] at night I am before thee.
019	PSA	088	002	Let my prayer come unto thy presence; incline thy ear unto my entreaty.
019	PSA	088	003	For my soul is sated with troubles; and my life draweth nigh unto the nether world.
019	PSA	088	004	I am counted with those that descend into the pit; I am become as a man without vigor:
019	PSA	088	005	Free among the dead, like the slain that dwell in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more; and those that are cut off by thy hand.
019	PSA	088	006	Thou hast laid me in the pit of the lower world, in darkness, in the depths.
019	PSA	088	007	Upon me lieth heavily thy fury, and with all thy billows hast thou afflicted me. (Selah)
019	PSA	088	008	Thou hast removed my acquaintances far from me; thou hast rendered me an abomination unto them: I am imprisoned, and I cannot go forth.
019	PSA	088	009	My eye languisheth by reason of affliction: I call on thee, O Lord, every day, I stretch out unto thee my hands.
019	PSA	088	010	Wilt thou display wonders to the dead? shall the departed arise [and] thank thee? (Selah)
019	PSA	088	011	Shall thy kindness be related in the grave? thy faithfulness in the place of corruption?
019	PSA	088	012	Shall thy wonders be acknowledged in the darkness? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
019	PSA	088	013	Yet I cry indeed aloud unto thee, O Lord; and in the morning shall my prayer come before thee.
019	PSA	088	014	Why, O Lord, wilt thou cast off my soul? [why] wilt thou hide thy face from me?
019	PSA	088	015	I am afflicted and perishing from my youth up: I bear thy terrors, I am distracted.
019	PSA	088	016	Over me have the fires of thy wrath passed; thy terrors have destroyed me;
019	PSA	088	017	They encompass me like water all the time; they have closed in round about me together.
019	PSA	088	018	Thou hast removed far from me lover and friend, my acquaintances [are in] darkness.
019	PSA	089	001	“A Maskil of Ethan the Ezrachite.” The kindnesses of the Lord will I for ever sing: from generation to generation will I make known thy faithfulness with my mouth.
019	PSA	089	002	For I have said, To eternity will kindness be built up: the heavens—yea, in these wilt thou establish thy faithfulness.
019	PSA	089	003	“I have made a covenant with my elect, I have sworn unto David my servant,
019	PSA	089	004	Unto eternity will I establish thy seed, and I will build up thy throne, from generation to generation.” (Selah)
019	PSA	089	005	And the heavens praise thy wonder, O Lord: also thy faithfulness in the assembly of holy ones.
019	PSA	089	006	For who in the sky can be compared unto the Lord? who can be likened unto the Lord among the sons of the mighty?
019	PSA	089	007	God is greatly terrific in the secret council of the holy ones and fear-inspiring over all that are about him.
019	PSA	089	008	O Lord God of hosts, who is powerful, like thee, Eternal! and thy faithfulness is round about thee.
019	PSA	089	009	Thou rulest over the pride of the sea: when its waves are lifted up, thou assuagest them.
019	PSA	089	010	Thou didst crush Rahab as one that is slain: with thy strong arm didst thou scatter thy enemies.
019	PSA	089	011	Thine are the heavens, also thine is the earth: as for the world and what filleth it, thou hast founded them.
019	PSA	089	012	The north and the south—these hast thou created: Tabor and Chermon shall rejoice in thy name.
019	PSA	089	013	Thine is the powerful arm, with might: strong is thy hand, and exalted is thy right hand.
019	PSA	089	014	Righteousness and justice are the prop of thy throne: kindness and truth precede thy presence.
019	PSA	089	015	Happy is the people that know the cornet's sound: O Lord, in the light of thy countenance will they ever walk firmly.
019	PSA	089	016	In thy name will they be glad all the day, and in thy righteousness will they be exalted.
019	PSA	089	017	For thou art the glory of their strength; and through thy favor will our horn be exalted.
019	PSA	089	018	For of the Lord is our shield; and of the Holy One of Israel is our king.
019	PSA	089	019	Then spokest thou in a vision to thy pious [servant], and saidst, “I have bestowed help to one that is mighty; I have exalted a youth out of the people;
019	PSA	089	020	I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him;
019	PSA	089	021	With whom my hand shall be firmly established; also my arm shall strengthen him;
019	PSA	089	022	The enemy shall not exact from him like a lender: and the son of injustice shall not afflict him:
019	PSA	089	023	And I will beat down before his face his assailants, and those that hate him will I plague.
019	PSA	089	024	But my faithfulness and my kindness shall be with him: and through my name shall his horn be exalted.
019	PSA	089	025	And I will place on the sea his hand, and on the rivers his right hand.
019	PSA	089	026	He will call unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation.
019	PSA	089	027	Also I will appoint my first-born, the highest among the kings of the earth.
019	PSA	089	028	For evermore will I keep for him my kindness, and my covenant shall stand faithfully with him.
019	PSA	089	029	And I appoint for ever his seed, and his throne as the days of heaven.
019	PSA	089	030	If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my ordinances;
019	PSA	089	031	If they profane my statutes, and keep not my commandments:
019	PSA	089	032	Then will I visit with the rod their transgressions, and with plagues their iniquity.
019	PSA	089	033	Nevertheless my kindness will I not make utterly void from him, and I will not act falsely against my faithfulness.
019	PSA	089	034	I will not profane my covenant, and what is gone out of my lips will I not alter.
019	PSA	089	035	One thing have I sworn by my holiness, that I will not lie unto David.
019	PSA	089	036	His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne shall be like the sun before me.
019	PSA	089	037	Like the moon shall it be firmly established for ever, and as this faithful witness in the sky.” (Selah)
019	PSA	089	038	And yet thou hast east off and despised, thou hast become wroth with thy anointed.
019	PSA	089	039	Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned, down to the ground, his crown.
019	PSA	089	040	Thou hast broken down all his fences: thou hast brought his strong-holds to terror.
019	PSA	089	041	All that pass by the way plunder him: he is become a reproach to his neighbors.
019	PSA	089	042	Thou hast raised up the right hand of his assailants: thou hast caused all his enemies to rejoice.
019	PSA	089	043	Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not let him stand erect in the battle.
019	PSA	089	044	Thou hast made his brilliancy cease; and his throne hast thou thrown down to the ground.
019	PSA	089	045	Thou hast shortened the days of his youth: thou hast enshrouded him with shame. (Selah)
019	PSA	089	046	How long, Lord, wilt thou hide thyself, continually? how long shall thy fury burn like fire?
019	PSA	089	047	Remember [what] I am, what my duration is [here], for what nothingness thou hast created all sons of men!
019	PSA	089	048	What man is there that can live, and shall not see death? that can deliver his soul from the power of the nether word? (Selah)
019	PSA	089	049	Where are thy former kindnesses, O Lord, which thou hast sworn unto David by thy truth?
019	PSA	089	050	Remember, Lord, the disgrace of thy servants; that I bear in my bosom the [burden] of all the many nations;
019	PSA	089	051	That thy enemies have defied, O Lord; that they have defied the footsteps of thy anointed.
019	PSA	089	052	Blessed be the Lord for evermore. Amen, and Amen.
019	PSA	090	001	BOOK FOURTH: “A prayer of Moses the man of God.” Lord, a place of refuge hast thou been unto us in all generations.
019	PSA	090	002	Before yet the mountains were brought forth, or thou hadst ever produced the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.
019	PSA	090	003	Thou turnest man to contrition, and sayest, Return ye children of men.
019	PSA	090	004	For a thousand years are in thy eyes but as the yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.
019	PSA	090	005	Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in the morning [they grow] like the grass which changeth.
019	PSA	090	006	In the morning it blossometh, and is changed: in the evening it is mowed off, and withereth.
019	PSA	090	007	For [thus] are we consumed by thy anger, and by thy fury are we terrified.
019	PSA	090	008	Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our concealed sins before the light of thy countenance.
019	PSA	090	009	For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we consume our years like a word that is spoken.
019	PSA	090	010	The days of our years in this life are seventy years; and if by uncommon vigor they be eighty, yet is their greatness trouble and mishap; for it soon hasteneth off, and we fly away.
019	PSA	090	011	Who knoweth the strength of thy anger, and thy wrath which is like the fear of thee?
019	PSA	090	012	Let us then know how to number our days, that we may obtain a heart endowed with wisdom.
019	PSA	090	013	Return, O Lord, how long yet? and bethink thee concerning thy servants.
019	PSA	090	014	O satisfy us in the morning with thy kindness, that we may be glad and rejoice throughout all our days.
019	PSA	090	015	Cause us to rejoice as many days as those wherein thou hast afflicted us, the years wherein we have seen unhappiness.
019	PSA	090	016	Let thy act be visible on thy servants, and thy majesty over their children.
019	PSA	090	017	And may the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us; and the work of our hands do thou firmly establish upon us: yea, the work of our hands—firmly establish thou it.
019	PSA	091	001	He who sitteth under the secret protection of the Most High, shall rest under the shadow of the Almighty.
019	PSA	091	002	I will say of the Lord, who is my refuge and my stronghold, my God, in whom I ever trust,
019	PSA	091	003	That he will surely deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the pestilence of destruction.
019	PSA	091	004	With his pinions will he cover thee, and under his wings shalt thou find shelter: shield and buckler is his truth.
019	PSA	091	005	Thou shalt not be afraid of the terror of the night; nor of the arrow that flieth by day;
019	PSA	091	006	Nor of the pestilence that stalketh in darkness; nor of the deadly disease that wasteth at noonday.
019	PSA	091	007	There shall fall at thy side a thousand, and ten thousand at thy right hand; unto thee [however] shall it not come nigh.
019	PSA	091	008	Only with thy eyes shalt thou behold it, and see the recompense of the wicked.
019	PSA	091	009	Because thou hast [said], The Lord is my protection, the Most High hast thou made thy refuge:
019	PSA	091	010	No evil shall befall thee, nor shall any plague come nigh unto thy tent.
019	PSA	091	011	For his angels will he give charge concerning thee, to guard thee on all thy ways.
019	PSA	091	012	Upon [their] hands shall they bear thee, that thou mayest not dash against a stone thy foot.
019	PSA	091	013	Upon the fierce lion and asp shalt thou tread: thou shalt trample under foot the young lion and serpent.
019	PSA	091	014	Because he hath fixed his desire upon me, therefore will I release him: I will set him on high, because he knoweth my name.
019	PSA	091	015	He will call on me, and I will answer him: with him will I be in distress; I will deliver him, and grant him honor.
019	PSA	091	016	With length of days will I satisfy him, and I will let him see my salvation.
019	PSA	092	001	“A psalm or song for the sabbath day.” It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing praises unto thy name, O Most High:
019	PSA	092	002	To tell in the morning of thy kindness, and of thy faithfulness in the nights.
019	PSA	092	003	Upon a ten-stringed instrument, and upon the psaltery; and with the sweet sound of the harp.
019	PSA	092	004	For thou hast caused me to rejoice, O Lord, through thy doing: because of the works of thy hands will I triumph.
019	PSA	092	005	How great are thy works, O Lord! exceedingly profound are thy thoughts.
019	PSA	092	006	A brutish man knoweth it not, and a fool cannot understand this.
019	PSA	092	007	When the wicked spring up like herbs, and when all the workers of wickedness do flourish; it is that they may be destroyed evermore.
019	PSA	092	008	But thou art exalted to eternity, O Lord!
019	PSA	092	009	For, lo, thy enemies, O Lord, for, lo, thy enemies shall perish: all the workers of wickedness shall be scattered.
019	PSA	092	010	But thou exaltest my horn like that of a reem: I am anointed with fresh oil.
019	PSA	092	011	And my eye looketh on [the punishment of] those that regard me with envy: of the evildoers that rise up against me my ears shall bear it.
019	PSA	092	012	The righteous shall spring up like the palm-tree: like a cedar in Lebanon shall he grow high.
019	PSA	092	013	Planted in the house of the Lord, in the courts of our God shall they spring up.
019	PSA	092	014	They shall still flourish in high old age; they shall be vigorous and covered with foliage;
019	PSA	092	015	To declare that the Lord is upright: he is my rock, and there is no faultiness in him.
019	PSA	093	001	The Lord reigneth, he is clothed with excellency; the Lord is clothed, he hath girded himself with strength: [therefore] also the world is firmly established, that it cannot be moved.
019	PSA	093	002	Firmly established is thy throne from the beginning: from everlasting art thou [God].
019	PSA	093	003	The rivers have lifted up, O Lord, the rivers have lifted up their voice; the rivers lift up their waves.
019	PSA	093	004	[But] more than the noise of great waters, than the mighty billows of the sea, is the Lord excellent on high.
019	PSA	093	005	Thy testimonies are exceedingly steadfast: in thy house abideth holiness, O Lord! to the utmost length of days.
019	PSA	094	001	O God, of vengeance, Lord! O God of vengeance, shine forth.
019	PSA	094	002	Lift up thyself, O judge of the Earth! bring a recompense upon the proud.
019	PSA	094	003	How long shall the wicked, O Lord—how long shall the wicked exult?
019	PSA	094	004	They sputter, they speak hard things: all the workers of wickedness boast themselves.
019	PSA	094	005	Thy people, O Lord! they crush, and thy heritage they afflict.
019	PSA	094	006	The widow and the stranger they slay, and the fatherless they murder.
019	PSA	094	007	And they say, The Lord will not see, and the God of Jacob will not take notice of it.
019	PSA	094	008	Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when will ye become intelligent!
019	PSA	094	009	He that hath planted the ear, shall he not hear? or he that hath formed the eye, shall he not see?
019	PSA	094	010	He that admonisheth nations, shall he not correct? is it not he that teacheth man knowledge!
019	PSA	094	011	The Lord knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are nought.
019	PSA	094	012	Happy is the man whom thou admonisheth, O Lord, and teachest him out of thy law:
019	PSA	094	013	That thou mayest grant him repose from the days of evil, until the pot be dug for the wicked.
019	PSA	094	014	For the Lord will not cast off his people, and his inheritance will he not forsake.
019	PSA	094	015	For unto righteousness will justice return; and it shall be followed by all the upright in heart.
019	PSA	094	016	Who will rise up for me against evil-doers? or who will stand forward for me against the workers of wickedness?
019	PSA	094	017	Unless the Lord had been a help unto me, but a little would have been wanting that my soul had dwelt in the silence of death.
019	PSA	094	018	When I said, My foot hath slipped: thy kindness, O Lord, sustained me.
019	PSA	094	019	In the multitude of my [painful] thoughts within me, thy consolations delight my soul.
019	PSA	094	020	Can there be associated with thee the throne of destructive wickedness, which frameth mischief as a law?
019	PSA	094	021	They band themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and innocent blood do they condemn.
019	PSA	094	022	But the Lord is become my defence, and my God, the rock of my refuge.
019	PSA	094	023	And he will bring back upon them their own injustice, and in their own wickedness will he destroy them: [yea], he will destroy them—the Lord our God.
019	PSA	095	001	O come, let us sing unto the Lord: let us shout joyfully to the rock of our salvation.
019	PSA	095	002	Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and shout joyfully unto him with psalms.
019	PSA	095	003	For a great God is the Lord, and a great King above all Gods;
019	PSA	095	004	In whose hand are the deep places of the earth; and whose are the heights of mountains;
019	PSA	095	005	Whose is the sea, and who hath made it; and whose hands have formed the dry land.
019	PSA	095	006	Oh come, let us prostrate ourselves and bow down: let us kneel before the Lord our Maker.
019	PSA	095	007	For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the flock of his hand: yea, this day, if ye will hearken to his voice,
019	PSA	095	008	Harden not your heart, as at Meribah, as on the day of the temptation in the wilderness:
019	PSA	095	009	When your fathers tempted me, proved me, although they had seen my doing.
019	PSA	095	010	Forty years long did I feel loathing on that generation, and I said, It is a people of an erring heart; and they truly acknowledged not my ways:
019	PSA	095	011	So that I swore in my wrath, that they should not enter into my rest.
019	PSA	096	001	Oh sing unto the Lord a new song: sing unto the Lord, all the lands.
019	PSA	096	002	Sing unto the Lord, bless his name: announce from day to day his salvation.
019	PSA	096	003	Relate among the nations his honor, among all the people his wonders.
019	PSA	096	004	For the Lord is great, and greatly praised: he is to be feared above all gods.
019	PSA	096	005	For all the gods of the nations are idols; but the Lord hath made the heavens.
019	PSA	096	006	Glory and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.
019	PSA	096	007	Ascribe unto the Lord, O ye families of the people, ascribe unto the Lord honor and strength.
019	PSA	096	008	Ascribe unto the Lord the honor [due unto] his name: bear hither a present, and come unto his courts.
019	PSA	096	009	Bow down unto the Lord in the beauty of holiness: tremble before him, all ye lands.
019	PSA	096	010	Say among the nations, “The Lord reigneth;” [therefore] also the world is ever firmly established that it shall hot be moved: he will judge the people in equity.
019	PSA	096	011	Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad: let the sea roar, with all that filleth it.
019	PSA	096	012	Let the field exult, and all that is therein: then shall all the trees of the forest sing for joy,
019	PSA	096	013	Before the Lord; for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he will judge the world with righteousness, and people in his truth.
019	PSA	097	001	The Lord reigneth: let the earth be glad; let the multitude of isles rejoice.
019	PSA	097	002	Clouds and thick darkness are round about him: righteousness and justice are the support of his throne.
019	PSA	097	003	A fire goeth before him, and burneth up round about his adversaries.
019	PSA	097	004	His lightnings give light to the world: the earth seeth it, and trembleth.
019	PSA	097	005	The mountains melt away like wax at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the Lord of all the earth.
019	PSA	097	006	The heavens tell of his righteousness, and all the people his glory.
019	PSA	097	007	Made ashamed shall be all that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: unto him bow down all the gods.
019	PSA	097	008	Zion heareth it, and rejoiceth; and glad are the daughters of Judah, because of thy decrees, O Lord.
019	PSA	097	009	For thou, O Lord, art the most high above all the earth: thou art greatly exalted above all gods.
019	PSA	097	010	Ye that love the Lord, hate ye the evil: he preserveth the souls of his pious ones; out of the hand of the wicked he ever delivereth them.
019	PSA	097	011	Light is sown for the righteous, and joy for the upright in heart.
019	PSA	097	012	Rejoice, ye righteous, in the Lord, and give thanks to his holy memorial.
019	PSA	098	001	“A psalm.” Oh sing unto the Lord a new song; for he hath done wonderful things: his right hand and his holy arm have gotten him the victory.
019	PSA	098	002	The Lord hath made known his salvation: before the eyes of the nations hath he revealed his righteousness.
019	PSA	098	003	He hath remembered his kindness and his truth toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
019	PSA	098	004	Shout joyfully unto the Lord, all the lands: break forth, and rejoice, and sing praises.
019	PSA	098	005	Sing praises unto the Lord with the harp, —with the harp, and the voice of psalmody.
019	PSA	098	006	With trumpets and the sound of cornet shout joyfully before the King, the Lord.
019	PSA	098	007	Let the sea roar, with all that filleth it; the world, with those that dwell therein.
019	PSA	098	008	Let the rivers clap their hands; let the mountains be joyful together,
019	PSA	098	009	Before the Lord; for he cometh to judge the earth: he will judge the world with righteousness, and people with equity.
019	PSA	099	001	The Lord reigneth; people tremble: he sitteth enthroned over the cherubim; the earth is moved.
019	PSA	099	002	The Lord is great in Zion; and he is exalted above all the people.
019	PSA	099	003	They will give thanks to thy name, great, and terrible, [and] holy it is.
019	PSA	099	004	And to the power of the king who loveth justice and righteousness hast thou truly executed in Jacob.
019	PSA	099	005	Exalt ye the Lord our God, and bow yourselves down before his footstool: he is holy.—
019	PSA	099	006	Moses and Aaron were among his priests, and Samuel among those that call on his name; they called on the Lord, and he answered them.
019	PSA	099	007	In the pillar of cloud he used to speak unto them: they kept his testimonies, and the statutes which he had given unto them.
019	PSA	099	008	O Lord, our God, thou didst answer them: thou wast a forgiving God unto them, yet also an avenger for their wrong doings.
019	PSA	099	009	Exalt the Lord our God, and bow yourselves down before his holy mount; for holy is the Lord our God.
019	PSA	100	001	“A psalm of thanksgiving.” Shout joyfully unto the Lord, all ye lands.
019	PSA	100	002	Serve the Lord with joy; come before his presence with triumphal song.
019	PSA	100	003	Know, that the Lord is God indeed: it is he that hath made us, and his are we—his people and the flock of his pasture.
019	PSA	100	004	Enter his gates with thanksgiving, his courts with praise: give thanks unto him, bless his name.
019	PSA	100	005	For the Lord is good; to eternity endureth his kindness; and unto the latest generation his truth.
019	PSA	101	001	“By David, a psalm.” Of kindness and justice will I sing: unto thee, O Lord, will I sing praises.
019	PSA	101	002	I will carefully regard the way of the perfect: oh when will thou come unto me? I will walk in the integrity of my heart in the midst of my house.
019	PSA	101	003	I will not set before my eyes a godless thing; to commit a departure [from righteousness] do I hate; it shall not cleave to me.
019	PSA	101	004	A perverse heart shall depart from me: evil will I not know.
019	PSA	101	005	Whoso slandereth in secret his neighbor, him will I destroy: whoso hath proud eyes and a haughty heart, him will I not suffer.
019	PSA	101	006	My eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may abide with me: he that walketh in the way of the perfect, he it is that shall serve me.
019	PSA	101	007	He that practiseth deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that speaketh falsehoods shall not succeed before my eyes.
019	PSA	101	008	Every morning will I destroy all the wicked of the land, cutting off from the city of the Lord all the wrong-doers.
019	PSA	102	001	“A prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out before the Lord his complaint.” O Lord, hear my prayer, and let my cry come unto thee.
019	PSA	102	002	Hide not thy face from me on the day when I am distressed; incline unto me thy ear; on the day when I call, answer me speedily.
019	PSA	102	003	For my days vanish in smoke, and my bones are burning like a hearth.
019	PSA	102	004	Struck [by heat] like the herb and dried up is my heart; for I forget to eat my bread.
019	PSA	102	005	Because of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my flesh.
019	PSA	102	006	I am like the pelican of the wilderness: I am become like the owl amid ruins.
019	PSA	102	007	I watch, and I am become like a [night-]bird sitting alone upon the housetop.
019	PSA	102	008	All the day my enemies reproach me: they that mock me swear by me.
019	PSA	102	009	For ashes do I eat like bread, and my drink I mingle with weeping;
019	PSA	102	010	Because of thy indignation and thy wrath; for thou hadst lifted me up, and hast cast me down.
019	PSA	102	011	My days are like a shadow that declineth; and like the herb I wither.
019	PSA	102	012	But thou, O Lord, wilt sit enthroned for ever; and thy memorial is unto all generations.
019	PSA	102	013	Thou wilt indeed arise; thou wilt have mercy upon Zion; for it is time to favor her, for the appointed time is coming.
019	PSA	102	014	For thy servants hold dear her stones, and her very dust they cherish.
019	PSA	102	015	Then shall nations fear the name of the Lord, and all the kings of the earth thy glory:
019	PSA	102	016	When the Lord shalt have built up Zion, he appeareth in his glory;
019	PSA	102	017	[When] he hath regarded the prayer of the forsaken, and doth not despise their prayer.
019	PSA	102	018	This shall be written down for the latest generation; and the people which shall be created shall praise the Lord.
019	PSA	102	019	For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; the Lord hath cast from heaven his view to the earth:
019	PSA	102	020	To hear the sighing of the prisoner; to loosen those that are doomed to death:
019	PSA	102	021	That men may proclaim in Zion the name of the Lord, and his praise in Jerusalem;
019	PSA	102	022	When people are gathered together, and kingdoms, to serve the Lord.—
019	PSA	102	023	He hath weakened on the way my strength; he hath shortened my days.
019	PSA	102	024	I will say, O my God! take me not away in the midst of my days: throughout all generations are thy years.
019	PSA	102	025	In olden times didst thou lay the foundations of the earth; and the heavens are the work of thy hands.
019	PSA	102	026	These will indeed perish, but thou wilt ever exist: yea, all of them will wear out like a garment; as a vesture wilt thou change them, and they will be changed;
019	PSA	102	027	But thou art ever the same, and thy years will have no end.
019	PSA	102	028	The children of thy servants will dwell [securely], and their seed will be firmly established before thee.
019	PSA	103	001	“Of David.” Bless, O my soul, the Lord, and all that is within me, his holy name.
019	PSA	103	002	Bless, O my soul, the Lord, and forget not all his benefits:
019	PSA	103	003	Who forgiveth all thy iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;
019	PSA	103	004	Who redeemeth from the pit thy life; who crowneth thee with kindness and mercies;
019	PSA	103	005	Who satisfieth with happiness thy spirit, so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's [plumage].
019	PSA	103	006	The Lord executeth righteousness, and justice for all that are oppressed.
019	PSA	103	007	He made known his ways unto Moses, unto the children of Israel his acts.
019	PSA	103	008	Merciful and gracious is the Lord, long-suffering and abundant in kindness.
019	PSA	103	009	Not for all eternity will he contend; nor will he for ever retain his anger.
019	PSA	103	010	Not in accordance with our sins hath he dealt with us; nor according to our iniquities hath he requited us.
019	PSA	103	011	For as high as heaven is above the earth, so mighty is his kindness toward those that fear him.
019	PSA	103	012	As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed from us our transgressions.
019	PSA	103	013	As a father hath mercy on his children, so hath the Lord mercy on those that fear him.
019	PSA	103	014	For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.
019	PSA	103	015	As for man, like the grass are his days: as the blossom of the field, so doth he bloom.
019	PSA	103	016	When a wind but passeth over it, it is gone, and its place will recognize it no more.
019	PSA	103	017	But the kindness of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting over those that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children,
019	PSA	103	018	To such as keep his covenant, and to those who remember his precepts to execute them.
019	PSA	103	019	The Lord hath established in the heavens his throne; and his kingdom ruleth over all.
019	PSA	103	020	Bless the Lord, ye his angels, mighty in strength, that execute his word, hearkening unto the voice of his word.
019	PSA	103	021	Bless ye the Lord, all his hosts, ye his ministers, that execute his will.
019	PSA	103	022	Bless the Lord, all his works, in all the places of his dominion; bless, O my soul, the Lord.
019	PSA	104	001	Bless, O my soul, the Lord. O Lord my God, thou art very great; with glory and majesty art thou clothed.
019	PSA	104	002	[Thou art he] who wrappeth himself in light as with a garment; who stretcheth out the heavens like a curtain;
019	PSA	104	003	Who frameth of the waters the beams of his upper-chambers; who maketh the clouds his chariot; who walketh along upon the wings of the wind:
019	PSA	104	004	Who maketh the winds his messengers; the flaming fire his ministers;
019	PSA	104	005	Who hath founded the earth upon her bases, that she should not be moved to all eternity.
019	PSA	104	006	Thou hadst covered the deep as with a garment: above the mountains stood the waters.
019	PSA	104	007	At thy rebuke they fled, at the voice of thy thunder they hastened away.
019	PSA	104	008	They ascended mountains; they went down valleys, unto the place which thou hadst founded for them.
019	PSA	104	009	Bounds hast thou set which they cannot pass over, that they return not again to cover the earth.
019	PSA	104	010	[Thou art he] who sendeth springs into the valleys, between mountains they run along.
019	PSA	104	011	They give drink to all the beasts of the field: the wild asses quench [thereon] their thirst.
019	PSA	104	012	By them have the fowls of the heaven ever their habitation, from between the branches they send forth their voice.
019	PSA	104	013	Who watereth the mountains from his upper-chambers: from the fruit of thy works is the earth satisfied.
019	PSA	104	014	[Thou art he] who causeth grass to grow for the cattle, and herbs by the service of man, that he may bring forth bread out of the earth;
019	PSA	104	015	And wine that maketh joyful the heart of man, [and] oil to brighten his face, and bread which strengtheneth the heart of man.
019	PSA	104	016	Full of sap are the trees of the Lord, the cedars of Lebanon which he hath planted;
019	PSA	104	017	Where the birds make their nests: the stork—fir-trees are her house.
019	PSA	104	018	The high mountains are for the wild goats: the rocks are a shelter for the conies.
019	PSA	104	019	He hath made the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.
019	PSA	104	020	Thou causest darkness, and it becometh night, wherein creep forth all the beasts of the forest.
019	PSA	104	021	The young lions roar after their prey, and ask from God their food.
019	PSA	104	022	The sun ariseth, they withdraw [to their lairs], and lie down in their dens.
019	PSA	104	023	Man goeth [then] forth unto his work, and to his labor until the evening.
019	PSA	104	024	How manifold are thy works, O Lord! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.
019	PSA	104	025	Here is this great and wide-extended sea; therein are moving things without number, living creatures both small and great.
019	PSA	104	026	There the ships make their way: [there also] is the leviathan, whom thou hast made to sport therein.
019	PSA	104	027	All of these wait upon thee, to give them their food in its due season.
019	PSA	104	028	What thou givest them they gather: thou openest thy hand, they are satisfied with good.
019	PSA	104	029	Thou hidest thy face, they suddenly vanish: thou takest away their spirit, they perish, and to their dust they return.
019	PSA	104	030	Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created; and thou renewest the face of the earth.
019	PSA	104	031	The glory of the Lord will endure for ever; the Lord will rejoice in his works:
019	PSA	104	032	He who looketh down on the earth, and she trembleth; who toucheth the mountains, and they smoke.
019	PSA	104	033	I will sing unto the Lord while I live: I will sing praises to my God while I exist.
019	PSA	104	034	May my speech be agreeable to him: I will indeed rejoice in the Lord.
019	PSA	104	035	May the sinners cease from off the earth, and the wicked be no more. Bless, O my soul, the Lord. Hallelujah.
019	PSA	105	001	O give thanks unto the Lord; call on his name: make known among the people his deeds.
019	PSA	105	002	Sing unto, him, sing praises unto him: speak of all his wonderful works.
019	PSA	105	003	Glorify yourselves in his holy name: let the heart of those rejoice that seek the Lord.
019	PSA	105	004	Inquire after the Lord and his strength: seek his presence evermore.
019	PSA	105	005	Remember his wonderful works which he hath done; his tokens, and the decrees of his mouth;
019	PSA	105	006	O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob, his elect.
019	PSA	105	007	He is the Lord our God: over all the earth are his decrees.
019	PSA	105	008	He remembereth his covenant for ever, the word which he hath commanded, to the thousandth generation.
019	PSA	105	009	Which he covenanted with Abraham; and his oath unto Isaac;
019	PSA	105	010	And which he established unto Jacob as a statute, unto Israel as an everlasting covenant:
019	PSA	105	011	Saying, “Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, as the portion of your inheritance.”
019	PSA	105	012	When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it;
019	PSA	105	013	And when they wandered from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people:
019	PSA	105	014	He suffered no man to oppress them; yea, he reproved kings for their sake;
019	PSA	105	015	[Saying,] “Touch not my anointed, and do my prophets no harm,”—
019	PSA	105	016	And he called for a famine over the land; every staff of bread he broke.
019	PSA	105	017	He sent a man before them; for a servant was Joseph sold;
019	PSA	105	018	They forced into fetters his feet; in iron was his body put:
019	PSA	105	019	Until the time that his word came to pass, [when] the saying of the Lord had purified him.
019	PSA	105	020	The king sent and unfettered him; the ruler of people, and let him go free.
019	PSA	105	021	He appointed him lord of his house, and ruler of all his possession:
019	PSA	105	022	That he might bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his ancients wisdom.
019	PSA	105	023	Then came Israel into Egypt, and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
019	PSA	105	024	And he increased his people greatly, and made them stronger than their adversaries.
019	PSA	105	025	He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilely with his servants.
019	PSA	105	026	He sent Moses his servant, Aaron also whom he had made choice of.
019	PSA	105	027	They displayed among them his effective signs, and wonders in the land of Ham.
019	PSA	105	028	He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.
019	PSA	105	029	He changed their waters into blood, and slew their fish.
019	PSA	105	030	Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the very chambers of their kings.
019	PSA	105	031	He spoke, and there came various wild beasts, lice also within all their boundary.
019	PSA	105	032	He gave them as their rain hail, and flames of fire in their land.
019	PSA	105	033	And he smote their vines and their fig-trees, and broke the trees within their boundary.
019	PSA	105	034	He spoke, and the locusts came, and crickets, and that without number;
019	PSA	105	035	And they ate up all the herbs in their land, and ate up the fruit of their ground.
019	PSA	105	036	And he smote all the first-born in their land, the first of all their strength.
019	PSA	105	037	And he brought them forth with silver and gold: and there was not one that stumbled among his tribes.
019	PSA	105	038	Egypt rejoiced when they departed; for the dread of them was fallen upon them.
019	PSA	105	039	He spread out a cloud for a covering, and fire to give light in the night.
019	PSA	105	040	The people asked, and he brought quails, and with heavenly bread he satisfied them.
019	PSA	105	041	He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out: they ran in the dry places like a river.
019	PSA	105	042	For he remembered his holy word given to Abraham his servant.
019	PSA	105	043	And he brought forth his people with gladness, with joyful song his elect.
019	PSA	105	044	And he gave them the lands of nations; and the labor of people they obtained as an inheritance:
019	PSA	105	045	So that they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Hallelujah.
019	PSA	106	001	Hallelujah. Oh give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good: for to eternity endureth his kindness.
019	PSA	106	002	Who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord? who can publish all his praise?
019	PSA	106	003	Happy are those that observe justice, that execute righteousness at all times.
019	PSA	106	004	Remember me, O Lord, when thou favorest thy people: oh visit me with thy salvation;
019	PSA	106	005	That I may look on the happiness of thy elect, that I may rejoice in the joy of thy nation, that I may glorify myself with thy inheritance.
019	PSA	106	006	We have sinned together with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.
019	PSA	106	007	Our fathers did not reflect on thy wonders in Egypt: they remembered not the multitude of thy kindnesses; but rebelled at the sea, even at the Red Sea.
019	PSA	106	008	Nevertheless he saved them for the sake of his name, to make known his might.
019	PSA	106	009	He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up; and he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.
019	PSA	106	010	And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
019	PSA	106	011	And the waters covered their adversaries: not one of them was left.
019	PSA	106	012	Then believed they in his words, they sang his praise.
019	PSA	106	013	Speedily they forgot his works, they waited not for his counsel;
019	PSA	106	014	And they felt a lustful longing in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.
019	PSA	106	015	And he gave them what they had asked; but sent dryness into their soul.
019	PSA	106	016	Moreover they envied Moses in the camp, and Aaron the holy one of the Lord.
019	PSA	106	017	The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered over the company of Abiram.
019	PSA	106	018	And a fire was kindled in their company: the flame burnt up the wicked.
019	PSA	106	019	They made a calf in Horeb, and bowed themselves down to a molten image.
019	PSA	106	020	And they exchanged their glory for the similitude of an ox that eateth herbs.
019	PSA	106	021	They forgot God their saviour, who had done great things in Egypt,
019	PSA	106	022	Wonders in the land of Ham, terrible things by the Red Sea.
019	PSA	106	023	He therefore spoke of destroying them: had not Moses his elect stood in the breach before him, to turn away his fury, that he might not destroy.
019	PSA	106	024	And they despised the pleasant land, they believed not in his word;
019	PSA	106	025	But they murmured in their tents, they hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord.
019	PSA	106	026	He therefore lifted up his hand against them, to cause them to fall in the wilderness;
019	PSA	106	027	And to let their seed fall among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.
019	PSA	106	028	And they joined themselves unto Ba'al-pe'or, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.
019	PSA	106	029	And they provoked him to anger with their deeds: and there broke in among them the plague.
019	PSA	106	030	Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and the plague was stayed.
019	PSA	106	031	And it was accounted unto him for righteousness, unto all generations for evermore.
019	PSA	106	032	They angered him also at the waters of Meribah, and evil happened to Moses for their sake;
019	PSA	106	033	Because they had embittered his spirit, and so he spoke thoughtlessly with his lips.
019	PSA	106	034	They did not exterminate the nations, that the Lord had indicated to them;
019	PSA	106	035	But they mingled themselves among the nations, and learned their doings.
019	PSA	106	036	And they served their idols, and these became unto them a snare.
019	PSA	106	037	Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto the evil spirits;
019	PSA	106	038	And they shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood-guiltiness.
019	PSA	106	039	Thus were they made unclean through their own doings, and went astray with their own deeds.
019	PSA	106	040	therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people, and be felt disgust for his own inheritance.
019	PSA	106	041	And he gave them up into the hand of the nations: and there ruled over them those that hated them.
019	PSA	106	042	And their enemies also oppressed them: and they were subdued under their hand.
019	PSA	106	043	Many times did he deliver them; but they rebelled with their counsel, and they were brought low through their iniquity.
019	PSA	106	044	Nevertheless he looked on when they were in distress, when he heard their entreaty.
019	PSA	106	045	And he remembered unto them his covenant, and he bethought himself according to the abundance of his kindnesses;
019	PSA	106	046	And be caused them to find mercy before all those that had carried them away captive.
019	PSA	106	047	Save us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the nations, to give thanks unto thy holy name, to triumph in thy praise.
019	PSA	106	048	Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel from everlasting even to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen, Hallelujah.
019	PSA	107	001	BOOK FIFTH: Oh give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good; for unto eternity endureth his kindness.
019	PSA	107	002	Thus let the Lord's redeemed say, even those whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the adversary;
019	PSA	107	003	And whom he hath gathered out of the [various] lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the sea.
019	PSA	107	004	They wandered about in the wilderness, in the desert path; they could not find an inhabited city:
019	PSA	107	005	Hungry and thirsty, their soul within them fainted.
019	PSA	107	006	Then they cried unto the Lord when they were in distress, [and] out of their afflictions he delivered them.
019	PSA	107	007	And he led them forth on the right way, that they might go to an inhabited city.
019	PSA	107	008	They [therefore] shall give thanks unto the Lord for his kindness, and [proclaim] his wonders to the children of men!
019	PSA	107	009	For he satisfied the longing soul, and the hungry soul he filled with good.—
019	PSA	107	010	Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, bound in misery and [fetters of] iron; —
019	PSA	107	011	Because they have rebelled against the words of God, and have contemned the counsel of the Most High;
019	PSA	107	012	And he humbled with trouble their heart; they stumbled, and there was none to help;
019	PSA	107	013	But when they cry unto the Lord when they are in distress, he saveth them out of their afflictions;
019	PSA	107	014	He bringeth them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and teareth their bands asunder.
019	PSA	107	015	They [therefore] shall give thanks unto the Lord for his kindness, and [proclaim] his wonders to the children of men!
019	PSA	107	016	For he hath broken the doors of copper, and the bolts of iron hath he hewn asunder.—
019	PSA	107	017	Fools, because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.
019	PSA	107	018	All manner of food their soul abhorreth; and they draw near unto the gates of death;
019	PSA	107	019	But when they cry unto the Lord when they are in distress, he saveth them out of their afflictions.
019	PSA	107	020	He sendeth his word and healeth them, and delivereth them from their graves.
019	PSA	107	021	They [therefore] shall give thanks unto the Lord for his kindness, and [proclaim] his wonders to the children of men!
019	PSA	107	022	They shall also sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and relate his deeds with joyful song.—
019	PSA	107	023	They who go down to the sea in ships, who do business on great waters; —
019	PSA	107	024	These have seen the works of the Lord, and his wonders on the deep.
019	PSA	107	025	For he spoke, and he raised the stormy wind, which lifteth up its waves.
019	PSA	107	026	They would mount up to heaven, they would go down to the depths: their soul was melted because of their danger.
019	PSA	107	027	They would reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and all their wisdom was exhausted.
019	PSA	107	028	And they cried unto the Lord when they were in distress, and he brought them out of their afflictions.
019	PSA	107	029	He calmed the storm into a whisper, and stilled were the waves of the sea.
019	PSA	107	030	And they were rejoiced because they were silent: and then he guided them unto their desired haven.
019	PSA	107	031	They [therefore] shall give thanks unto the Lord for his kindness, and [proclaim] his wonders to the children of men!
019	PSA	107	032	And they must exalt him in the congregation of the people, and in the assembly of the elders must they praise him.—
019	PSA	107	033	He changeth rivers into a wilderness, and water-springs into parched ground;
019	PSA	107	034	A fruitful land into a salty waste, for the wickedness of those that dwell therein.
019	PSA	107	035	He changeth the wilderness into a pool of water, and desert land into water-springs.
019	PSA	107	036	And there he causeth to dwell the hungry, that they may found an inhabited city;
019	PSA	107	037	And they sow fields, and plant vineyards, that they may yield the fruits of the [annual] product.
019	PSA	107	038	He also blesseth them, and they multiply greatly, and he suffereth not their cattle to diminish.
019	PSA	107	039	They were also diminished and bowed low through oppression, misfortune, and sorrow:
019	PSA	107	040	He [then] poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in a pathless wilderness.
019	PSA	107	041	And he exalteth the needy from misery, and maketh [his] families like flocks.
019	PSA	107	042	The righteous shall see it, and rejoice; but all wickedness shall stop her mouth.
019	PSA	107	043	Whoever is wise, let him observe these things, and let [all] understand the kindness of the Lord.
019	PSA	108	001	“A song or psalm of David.” My heart is firm, O God; I will sing and give praise, even with my spirit.
019	PSA	108	002	Awake, psaltery and harp: I will wake up the morning-dawn.
019	PSA	108	003	I will give thee thanks among the people, O Lord: and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.
019	PSA	108	004	For great above the heavens is thy kindness, and thy truth reacheth even unto the skies.
019	PSA	108	005	Exalt thyself above the heavens, O God; and above all the earth thy glory.
019	PSA	108	006	In order that thy beloved may be delivered: help with thy right hand, and answer me.
019	PSA	108	007	God hath spoken in his holiness: I will exult, I will divide Shechem, and the valley of Succoth will I measure out.
019	PSA	108	008	Mine id Gil'ad, and mine is Menasseh; Ephraim also is the strong-hold of my head; of Judah are my chiefs.
019	PSA	108	009	Moab is my washpot; upon Edom will I cast my shoe; over Philistia will I triumph.
019	PSA	108	010	Who will bring me into the fortified city? who will lead me as far as Edom?
019	PSA	108	011	Behold, it is thou, O God, who hast cast us off; and thou, O God, goest not forth with our armies.
019	PSA	108	012	Give us help against the assailant; for vain is the help of man.
019	PSA	108	013	Through God shall we do valiantly; for he it is that will tread down our adversaries.
019	PSA	109	001	“To the chief musician, by David, a psalm.” O God of my praise, do not keep silence.
019	PSA	109	002	For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit are opened against me: they have spoken with me with the tongue of falsehood.
019	PSA	109	003	Also with words of hatred have they encompassed me, and they fight against me without a cause.
019	PSA	109	004	In recompense for my love are they my accusers, while I have nothing but prayer.
019	PSA	109	005	And they impose evil on me in recompense for good, and hatred in lieu of my love.
019	PSA	109	006	Appoint thou a wicked man over him: and let an accuser stand at his right hand.
019	PSA	109	007	When he is to be judged, let him go forth guilty, and let his prayer become sin.
019	PSA	109	008	Let his days be few, and let another take his office.
019	PSA	109	009	Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.
019	PSA	109	010	Let his children be continually moving about, and beg, and let them seek [their bread] out of their ruined places.
019	PSA	109	011	Let the creditor lay snares after all that he hath, and let strangers plunder his labor.
019	PSA	109	012	Let him have none that extendeth kindness, and let there be none that is gracious to his fatherless children.
019	PSA	109	013	Let his posterity be cut off: in another generation let their name be blotted out.
019	PSA	109	014	Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered by the Lord, and let the sin of his mother not be blotted out.
019	PSA	109	015	Let them be before the Lord continually, that he may cut off from the earth their memory.
019	PSA	109	016	For the reason that he remembered not to show kindness; but persecuted the poor and needy man, and the grieved in heart to put him to death.
019	PSA	109	017	As he loved cursing, so let it come over him: and as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.
019	PSA	109	018	And he clothed himself with cursing as with his garment, and it cometh like water within him, and like oil into his bones.
019	PSA	109	019	Let it be unto him as a garment in which he wrappeth himself, and for a girdle let him be continually girded with it.
019	PSA	109	020	Let this be the reward of my accusers from the Lord, and of those that speak evil against my soul.
019	PSA	109	021	But thou, O Eternal Lord, deal with me for the sake of thy name: because thy kindness is good, deliver thou me.
019	PSA	109	022	For poor and needy am I, and my heart is deeply wounded within me.
019	PSA	109	023	Like the shadow when it declineth do I hasten away: I am driven suddenly off like the locusts.
019	PSA	109	024	My knees stumble through fasting, and my flesh faileth of fatness.
019	PSA	109	025	And I am become a reproach unto them: when they see me, they shake their head.
019	PSA	109	026	Help me, O Lord my God: O save me according to thy kindness:
019	PSA	109	027	That they may know that this is thy hand: that thou, Lord, hast truly done it.
019	PSA	109	028	Let them then curse, but do thou bless: when they arise, let them be made ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.
019	PSA	109	029	Let my accusers be clothed with confusion, and let them wrap themselves, as with a mantle, in their own shame.
019	PSA	109	030	I will thank the Lord greatly with my mouth, and in the midst of many will I praise him.
019	PSA	109	031	For he ever standeth at the right hand of the needy, to save him from those that judge his soul.
019	PSA	110	001	“By David, a psalm.” The Eternal saith unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I place thy enemies as a stool for thy feet.
019	PSA	110	002	The staff of thy strength will the Eternal stretch forth out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thy enemies.
019	PSA	110	003	Thy people will bring freewill-gifts on the day of thy power, in the ornaments of holiness: as out of the bosom of the morning-dawn so is thine the dew of thy youth.
019	PSA	110	004	The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent of it, Thou shalt be a priest for ever after the order of Malki-zedek.
019	PSA	110	005	The Lord at thy right hand crusheth kings on the day of his wrath.
019	PSA	110	006	He will judge among the nations—there shall be a fulness of corpses—he crusheth heads on a wide-spread land.
019	PSA	110	007	From the brook will he drink on the way: therefore will he lift up the head.
019	PSA	111	001	Hallelujah. I will thank the Lord with all [my] heart, in the council of the upright, and in the congregation.
019	PSA	111	002	Great are the works of the Lord, they are sought for [by them] in all their desires.
019	PSA	111	003	Glorious and majestic is his doing, and his righteousness endureth for ever.
019	PSA	111	004	He hath made a memorial for his wonderful works: gracious and merciful is the Lord.
019	PSA	111	005	He hath given sustenance unto those that fear him: he will for ever be mindful of his covenant.
019	PSA	111	006	The power of his works hath he told unto his people, that he might give them the heritage of nations.
019	PSA	111	007	The works of his hands are truth and justice: faultless are all his precepts.
019	PSA	111	008	They are well supported for ever and eternally: they are framed in truth and uprightness.
019	PSA	111	009	Redemption hath he sent unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and to be feared is his name.
019	PSA	111	010	The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the Lord; a good understanding have all that fulfill [his commandments]: his praise endureth for ever.
019	PSA	112	001	Hallelujah. Happy is the man that feareth the Lord, that greatly delighteth in his commandments.
019	PSA	112	002	His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright shall be blessed.
019	PSA	112	003	Plenty and riches shall be in his house, and his righteousness shall endure for ever.
019	PSA	112	004	There ariseth in the darkness a light to the upright: he is gracious, and merciful, and righteous.
019	PSA	112	005	Well will it be with the man who is kind, and lendeth: he will guide his affairs with justice.
019	PSA	112	006	Surely unto eternity shall he not be moved: in everlasting remembrance shall the righteous be held.
019	PSA	112	007	Of an evil report shall he not be afraid: his heart is firm, trusting in the Lord.
019	PSA	112	008	Well supported is his heart, he shall not be afraid, until he looketh on [the punishment of] his assailants.
019	PSA	112	009	He distributeth, he giveth to the needy: his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted in honor.
019	PSA	112	010	The wicked shall see it, and be vexed; he will gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the longing of the wicked shall perish.
019	PSA	113	001	Hallelujah. Praise, O ye servants of the Lord, praise ye the name of the Lord.
019	PSA	113	002	Let the name of the Lord be blessed from this time forth and for evermore.
019	PSA	113	003	From the rising of the sun unto his going down the name of the Lord is praised.
019	PSA	113	004	High above all nations is the Lord, above the heavens is his glory.
019	PSA	113	005	Who is like the Lord our God, who dwelleth on high?
019	PSA	113	006	Who condescendeth to view what is done in the heavens, and on the earth?
019	PSA	113	007	He raiseth up out of the dust the poor, from the dunghill he lifteth up the needy:
019	PSA	113	008	That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people.
019	PSA	113	009	He causeth the barren woman to dwell in the midst of [her] household, the joyful mother of children. Hallelujah.
019	PSA	114	001	When Israel went forth out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of a strange language:
019	PSA	114	002	Judah became his sanctuary, [and] Israel his dominion.
019	PSA	114	003	The sea beheld it, and fled: the Jordan was driven backward.
019	PSA	114	004	The mountains skipped like wethers, the hills like lambs.
019	PSA	114	005	What aileth thee, O sea, that thou fleest? thou, O Jordan, that thou art driven backward?
019	PSA	114	006	Ye mountains, that ye skip like wethers? ye hills, like lambs?
019	PSA	114	007	At the presence of the Lord tremble, O earth, at the presence of the God of Jacob;
019	PSA	114	008	Who changeth the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a fountain of water.
019	PSA	115	001	Not for our sake, O Lord, not for our sake, but unto thy name give glory, for the sake of thy kindness, for the sake of thy truth.
019	PSA	115	002	Wherefore should the nations say, Where now is their God?
019	PSA	115	003	Whereas our God is in the heavens: whatsoever he desireth hath he done.
019	PSA	115	004	Their idols are sliver and gold, the work of the hands of man.
019	PSA	115	005	A mouth they have, but speak not; eyes they have, but see not;
019	PSA	115	006	Ears they have, but hear not; a nose they have, but smell not.
019	PSA	115	007	They have hands, but they touch not; they have feet, but they walk not: nor do they give any utterance by their throat.
019	PSA	115	008	Like them are those that make them, every one that trusteth in them.
019	PSA	115	009	O Israel, trust thou in the Lord—he is their help and their shield.
019	PSA	115	010	O house of Aaron, trust ye in the Lord—he is their help and their shield.
019	PSA	115	011	Ye that fear the Lord, trust ye in the Lord—he is their help and their shield.
019	PSA	115	012	The Lord hath even been mindful of us, he will bless [us]; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron;
019	PSA	115	013	He will bless those that fear the Lord, the small together with the great.
019	PSA	115	014	May the Lord increase you more and more, you and your children.
019	PSA	115	015	Blessed are ye of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
019	PSA	115	016	The heavens are the heavens of the Lord; but the earth hath he given to the children of men.
019	PSA	115	017	Not the dead can praise the Lord, nor all those that go down into the silence [of death].
019	PSA	115	018	But as for us, we will bless the Lord from this time forth and for evermore. Hallelujah.
019	PSA	116	001	It is lovely to me that the Lord heareth my voice, my supplications.
019	PSA	116	002	For he hath inclined his ear unto me: therefore throughout all my days will I call on him.
019	PSA	116	003	The bands of death had compassed me, and the pangs of the nether world had overtaken me; I had met with distress and sorrow:
019	PSA	116	004	I then called on the name of the Lord, I beseech thee, O Lord, release my soul.
019	PSA	116	005	Gracious is the Lord, and righteous; and our God is merciful.
019	PSA	116	006	The Lord preserveth the simple: I was in misery, and he helped me.
019	PSA	116	007	Return, O my soul, unto thy rest; for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee.
019	PSA	116	008	For thou hast delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from falling.
019	PSA	116	009	I will walk before the Lord in the land of life.
019	PSA	116	010	I believe, therefore will I speak: I was greatly afflicted;
019	PSA	116	011	I indeed said in my despondency, Every man is a liar.
019	PSA	116	012	What shall I give in return unto the Lord for all his bounties toward me?
019	PSA	116	013	The cup of salvation will I lift up, and on the name of the Lord will I call.
019	PSA	116	014	My vows will I pay unto the Lord, yea, in the presence of all his people.
019	PSA	116	015	Grievous in the eyes of the Lord is the death of his pious ones.
019	PSA	116	016	O Lord, truly am I thy servant, I am thy servant, —the son of thy handmaid: thou hast loosened my fetters.
019	PSA	116	017	Unto thee will I offer the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and on the name of the Lord will I call.
019	PSA	116	018	My vows will I pay unto the Lord, yea, in the presence of all his people,
019	PSA	116	019	In the courts of the house of the Lord, in thy midst, O Jerusalem. Hallelujah.
019	PSA	117	001	Praise the Lord, all ye nations: praise him, all ye people.
019	PSA	117	002	For mighty is his kindness over us: and the truth of the Lord endureth for ever. Hallelujah.
019	PSA	118	001	O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good; because unto eternity endureth his kindness.
019	PSA	118	002	Let Israel then say so; because to eternity endureth his kindness.
019	PSA	118	003	Let the house of Aaron then say so; because to eternity endureth his kindness.
019	PSA	118	004	Let those who fear the Lord then say so; because to eternity endureth his kindness.
019	PSA	118	005	From the midst of distress I called on the Lord; the Lord answered me with enlargement.
019	PSA	118	006	The Lord is for me; I will not fear: what can a man do unto me?
019	PSA	118	007	The Lord is for me, among those that help me: therefore shall I indeed look on [the punishment of] those that hate me.
019	PSA	118	008	It is better to seek shelter with the Lord than to trust in man.
019	PSA	118	009	It is better to seek shelter with the Lord than to trust in princes.
019	PSA	118	010	All nations encompassed me about; but in the name of the Lord I will surely cut them off.
019	PSA	118	011	They encompassed me about: yea, they compassed about, but in the name of the Lord I will surely cut them off.
019	PSA	118	012	They encompassed me about like bees; they blazed up like the fire of thorns; but in the name of the Lord I will surely cut them off.
019	PSA	118	013	Thou hast thrust violently at me that I might fall; but the Lord assisted me.
019	PSA	118	014	My strength and song is the Lord, and he is become my salvation.
019	PSA	118	015	The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents of the righteous: the right hand of the Lord doth valiantly.
019	PSA	118	016	The right hand of the Lord is exalted: the right hand of the Lord doth valiantly.
019	PSA	118	017	I shall not die, but I shall live, and relate the works of the Lord.
019	PSA	118	018	Severely hath the Lord chastised me; but unto death hath he not given me up.
019	PSA	118	019	Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will enter into them. I will give thanks unto the Lord.
019	PSA	118	020	This is the gate which belongeth unto the Lord, the righteous shall enter thereby.
019	PSA	118	021	I will thank thee: for thou but answered me, and art become my salvation.
019	PSA	118	022	The stone which the builders rejected is become the chief corner-stone.
019	PSA	118	023	From the Lord is this come to pass, it is marvelous in our eyes.
019	PSA	118	024	This is the day which the Lord hath made, we will be glad and rejoice thereon.
019	PSA	118	025	We beseech thee, O Lord, save [us] now: we beseech thee, O Lord, send [us] now prosperity.
019	PSA	118	026	Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord: we bless you out of the house of the Lord.
019	PSA	118	027	God is the Lord, and he giveth us light: bind the festive sacrifice with cords, [leading it] up to the horns of the altar.
019	PSA	118	028	Thou art my God, and I will thank thee: my God, I will exalt thee.
019	PSA	118	029	Oh give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good; because to eternity endureth his kindness.
019	PSA	119	001	ALEPH. Happy are they whose way is perfect, who walk in the law of the Lord.
019	PSA	119	002	Happy are they who keep his testimonies, that seek him with all their heart.
019	PSA	119	003	They also commit no injustice; in his ways do they walk.
019	PSA	119	004	Thou thyself hast commanded us thy precepts, that we might keep [them] diligently.
019	PSA	119	005	Oh that my ways were firmly directed to observe thy statutes!
019	PSA	119	006	Then would I not be made ashamed, while I look at all thy commandments.
019	PSA	119	007	I will thank thee with uprightness of heart, when I learn thy righteous ordinances.
019	PSA	119	008	Thy statutes will I observe: oh forsake me not too greatly.
019	PSA	119	009	BETH. Wherewithal shall a youth keep his way pure? by guarding it according to thy word.
019	PSA	119	010	With all my heart have I sought thee: oh let me not wander astray from thy commandments.
019	PSA	119	011	In my heart have I treasured up thy saying, in order that I may not sin against thee.
019	PSA	119	012	Blessed art thou, O Lord: teach me thy statutes.
019	PSA	119	013	With my lips have I related all the ordinances of thy mouth.
019	PSA	119	014	On the way of thy testimonies have I been glad, as over all wealth.
019	PSA	119	015	On thy precepts will I meditate, and direct my look unto thy paths.
019	PSA	119	016	In thy statutes will I seek my delight: I will not forget thy word.
019	PSA	119	017	GIMEL. Deal bountifully with thy servant: let me live, that I may observe thy word.
019	PSA	119	018	Open thou my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.
019	PSA	119	019	A stranger am I on the earth: hide not from me thy commandments.
019	PSA	119	020	My soul is broken from longing for thy ordinances at all times.
019	PSA	119	021	Thou hast rebuked the accursed proud, who go erringly astray from thy commandments.
019	PSA	119	022	Roll away from me reproach and contempt; for thy testimonies have I kept.
019	PSA	119	023	Although even princes should sit and speak against me, thy servant would still meditate on thy statutes.
019	PSA	119	024	Also thy testimonies are my delight, my counsellors.
019	PSA	119	025	DALETH. My soul cleaveth unto the dust: revive thou me according to thy word.
019	PSA	119	026	My ways do I relate [to thee], and thou answerest me: teach me thy statutes.
019	PSA	119	027	Cause me to understand the way of thy precepts, that I may meditate on thy wonders.

019	PSA	119	029	The way of falsehood do thou remove from me, and grant me graciously thy law.

019	PSA	119	043	And snatch not the word of truth out of my mouth too greatly; for I wait for thy ordinances.

019	PSA	119	048	And so will I lift up my hands unto thy commandments, which I love, and I will meditate on thy statutes.
019	PSA	119	049	ZAYIN. Remember thy word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to wait.

019	PSA	119	056	This came to pass unto me, because I had kept thy precepts.

019	PSA	119	059	I have thought over my ways, and made my feet return unto thy testimonies.
019	PSA	119	060	I hastened, and delayed not to observe thy commandments.
019	PSA	119	061	Companies of wicked men have surrounded me; but I have not forgotten thy law.
019	PSA	119	062	At midnights do I constantly rise to give thanks unto thee, because of thy righteous decrees.

019	PSA	119	084	How many are the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute justice on my persecutors?
019	PSA	119	085	The presumptuous have dug pits for me, which is not in accordance with thy law.
019	PSA	119	086	All thy commandments are founded on truth: without cause they persecute me; help thou me.

019	PSA	119	118	Thou hast trodden down all that erringly stray from thy statutes; for falsehood is their deceit.
019	PSA	119	119	Like dross dost thou put away all the wicked of the earth: therefore do I love thy testimonies.
019	PSA	119	120	My flesh trembleth shudderingly from dread of thee, and of thy decrees am I afraid.

019	PSA	119	128	Therefore do I esteem all thy precepts in all things as right: every path of falsehood do I hate.
019	PSA	119	129	PE. Wonderful are thy testimonies: therefore doth my soul keep them.
019	PSA	119	130	The opening of thy words giveth light, it giveth understanding unto the simple.
019	PSA	119	131	I opened my mouth, and panted for breath; because for thy commandments did I long.
019	PSA	119	132	Turn thou unto me, and be gracious unto me, as is thy wont unto those that love thy name.
019	PSA	119	133	My steps establish thou through thy promise, and suffer not any wrong to have dominion over me.

019	PSA	119	136	Streams of water have run down my eyes; because they had not observed thy law.

019	PSA	119	138	Thou hast commanded thy testimonies, as righteous and faithful exceedingly.
019	PSA	119	139	My zeal destroyeth me; because my assailants have forgotten thy words.
019	PSA	119	140	Thy promise is greatly refined, and thy servant loveth it.
019	PSA	119	141	I am little and despised: yet thy precepts have I not forgotten.
019	PSA	119	142	Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth.

019	PSA	119	150	They that pursue mischievous devices draw nigh: from thy law are they far.
019	PSA	119	151	Near art thou, O Lord; and all thy commandments are the truth.
019	PSA	119	152	Of old already I knew of thy testimonies; because for eternity hast thou founded them.

019	PSA	119	176	I have gone erringly astray like a lost sheep: seek thy servant; for thy commandments have I not forgotten.
019	PSA	120	001	“A song of the degrees.” Unto the Lord, when I was in distress, did I call, and he hath answered me.
019	PSA	120	002	O Lord, deliver my soul from lips of falsehood, and from a tongue of deceit.
019	PSA	120	003	What will [God] give unto thee? or what will he add unto thee, thou tongue of deceit?
019	PSA	120	004	Sharpened arrows of the mighty, with coals of the broom-bush.
019	PSA	120	005	Woe is me, that I sojourn in Meshech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar!
019	PSA	120	006	Too long for herself hath my soul dwelt with him that hateth peace.
019	PSA	120	007	I am for peace; but when I speak, they are for war.
019	PSA	121	001	“A song for the degrees.” I lift up my eyes unto the mountains: whence shall come my help?
019	PSA	121	002	My help is from the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth.
019	PSA	121	003	He will not suffer thy foot to slip: thy keeper doth not slumber.
019	PSA	121	004	Behold, he slumbereth not, and he sleepeth not—the keeper of Israel.
019	PSA	121	005	The Lord is thy keeper: the Lord is thy shade, he is on thy right hand.
019	PSA	121	006	By day the sun shall not strike thee, nor the moon by night.
019	PSA	121	007	The Lord will guard thee against all evil: he will guard thy soul.
019	PSA	121	008	The Lord will guard thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth and for evermore.
019	PSA	122	001	“A song of the degrees by David.” I was rejoiced when they said unto me, Unto the house of the Lord let us go.
019	PSA	122	002	Our feet are now standing within thy gates, O Jerusalem!
019	PSA	122	003	Jerusalem, which art built as a city wherein all associate together.
019	PSA	122	004	For thither go up the tribes of the Lord, as a testimony for Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the Lord.
019	PSA	122	005	For there are placed chairs for [giving] judgment, the chairs for the house of David.—
019	PSA	122	006	Pray ye for the peace of Jerusalem; may those that love thee prosper.
019	PSA	122	007	May there be peace within thy walls, prosperity within thy palaces,
019	PSA	122	008	For the sake of my brethren and my friends, let me now speak, Peace be within thee.
019	PSA	122	009	For the sake of the house of the Lord our God, will I seek thy good.
019	PSA	123	001	“A song of the degrees.” Unto thee do I lift up my eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens.
019	PSA	123	002	Behold, as the eyes of servants are directed unto the hand of their masters, as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress: thus are our eyes directed unto the Lord our God, until he be gracious unto us.
019	PSA	123	003	Be gracious unto us, O Lord! be gracious unto us; for we are overburdened with contempt.
019	PSA	123	004	Our soul is overburdened with the scorn of those who are at ease, with the contempt of the proud oppressors.
019	PSA	124	001	“A song of the degrees by David.” If it had not been the Lord who was for us, so should Israel say;
019	PSA	124	002	If it had not been the Lord who was for us, when men rose up against us:
019	PSA	124	003	Then would they have swallowed us up alive, when their wrath was kindled against us;
019	PSA	124	004	Then would the waters have overwhelmed us, the stream would have passed over our soul;
019	PSA	124	005	Then would have passed over our soul the presumptuous waters.
019	PSA	124	006	Blessed be the Lord, who hath not given us up as a prey to their teeth.
019	PSA	124	007	Our soul is escaped like a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped.
019	PSA	124	008	Our help is in the name of the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth.
019	PSA	125	001	“A song of the degrees.” Those who trust in the Lord are like mount Zion, which will not he moved, which endureth for ever.
019	PSA	125	002	Jerusalem hath mountains round about her: and [so] is the Lord round about his people, from this time forth and for evermore.
019	PSA	125	003	For the sceptre of wickedness shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous: in order that the righteous may not stretch forth their hands unto wrong-doing.
019	PSA	125	004	Do good, O Lord, unto the good, and to those that are upright in their hearts.
019	PSA	125	005	But as for those who turn aside unto their crooked ways, them will the Lord drive away with the workers of wickedness; but peace shall be upon Israel.
019	PSA	126	001	“A song of the degrees.” When the Lord bringeth back again the captivity of Zion, then shall we be like dreamers.
019	PSA	126	002	Then shall our mouth be filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then shall they say among the nations, Great things hath the Lord done for these.
019	PSA	126	003	Great things would the Lord have done for us, [whereat] we should be joyful.
019	PSA	126	004	Bring back again, O Lord, our captivity, like rivulets in arid land.
019	PSA	126	005	Those that sow in tears shall reap with joyful song.
019	PSA	126	006	He goeth forth indeed and weepeth, that beareth the seed for sowing; but he will surely come with joyful song when he beareth [home] his sheaves.
019	PSA	127	001	“A song of the degrees for Solomon.” Unless the Lord do build the house, in vain labor they that build on it: unless the Lord guard the city, in vain is the watchman wakeful.
019	PSA	127	002	It is in vain for you to be early in rising, to be late in sitting up, eating the bread of painful toils; [for] so doth he give unto his beloved during sleep.
019	PSA	127	003	Lo, children are an inheritance from the Lord: a reward is the fruit of the body.
019	PSA	127	004	Like arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the children of youth.
019	PSA	127	005	Happy is the man that hath his quiver filled with them: they shall not be put to shame, when they do speak with the enemies in the gate.
019	PSA	128	001	“A song of the degrees.” Happy is every one that feareth the Lord, that walketh in his ways.
019	PSA	128	002	When thou eatest the labor of thy hands: [then] wilt thou be happy, and it shall be well with thee.
019	PSA	128	003	Thy wife is [then] as a fruitful vine in the recesses of thy house: thy children, like olive-plants round about thy table.
019	PSA	128	004	Behold, truly thus shall be blessed the man that feareth the Lord.
019	PSA	128	005	May the Lord bless thee out of Zion: and see thou the happiness of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.
019	PSA	128	006	And see thou thy children's children: may there be peace upon Israel.
019	PSA	129	001	“A song of the degrees.” Many a time have they assailed me from my youth, so should Israel say;
019	PSA	129	002	Many a time have they assailed me from my youth: yet have they not prevailed against me.
019	PSA	129	003	Upon my back have ploughmen ploughed; they have drawn long their furrows:
019	PSA	129	004	[Yet] the Lord is righteous; he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.
019	PSA	129	005	May all be put to shame and turned backward that hate Zion;
019	PSA	129	006	May they become like the grass of the roofs, which withereth before it is pulled up;
019	PSA	129	007	Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor his arm he that bindeth sheaves.
019	PSA	129	008	Nor do they who pass by say, The blessing of the Lord be with you: we bless you in the name of the Lord.
019	PSA	130	001	“A song of the degrees.” Out of the depths have I called thee, O Lord.
019	PSA	130	002	Lord, listen to my voice: let thy ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.
019	PSA	130	003	If thou, Lord, shouldst treasure up iniquities, O Lord, who would be able to stand?
019	PSA	130	004	But with thee there is forgiveness, in order that thou mayest be feared.
019	PSA	130	005	I hope for the Lord, my soul doth hope, and for his word do I wait.
019	PSA	130	006	My soul [waiteth] for the Lord, more than they that watch for the morning expect the morning.
019	PSA	130	007	Let Israel wait for the Lord; for with the Lord there is kindness, and with him is redemption in abundance;
019	PSA	130	008	And he wilt surely redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
019	PSA	131	001	“A song of the degrees by David.” O Lord, my heart was not haughty, nor were my eyes lofty: neither have I walked after matters too great, or those too wonderful for me.
019	PSA	131	002	Surely I have pacified and stilled my soul, like the suckling on its mother's breast: like a suckling is in me my soul.
019	PSA	131	003	Let Israel wait for the Lord from this time forth and for ever more.
019	PSA	132	001	“A song of the degrees.” Remember, O Lord, unto David all his afflictions;
019	PSA	132	002	How he swore unto the Lord; how he vowed unto the mighty One of Jacob:
019	PSA	132	003	Surely, I will not enter into the tent of my house, nor ascend the couch of my repose;
019	PSA	132	004	I will not grant any sleep to my eyes, nor to my eyelids any slumber:
019	PSA	132	005	Until I shall have found out a place for the Lord, a dwelling-place for the mighty One of Jacob.
019	PSA	132	006	“Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we met with it in the fields of the forest:
019	PSA	132	007	let us then go into his dwelling: let us prostrate ourselves before his footstool.”
019	PSA	132	008	Arise, O Lord, unto thy resting-place: thou, and the ark of thy strength.
019	PSA	132	009	Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy pious servants shout for joy.
019	PSA	132	010	For the sake of David thy servant turn not away the face of thy anointed.
019	PSA	132	011	The Lord hath sworn unto David in truth; he will not turn from it: “From the fruit of thy body will I set [some one] on the throne to succeed thee.
019	PSA	132	012	If thy children will observe my covenant and this my testimony which I teach them: then also shall their children sit for evermore upon the throne to succeed thee.”
019	PSA	132	013	For the Lord hath made choice of Zion: he hath desired it as a habitation for himself.
019	PSA	132	014	This is my resting-place for evermore: here will I dwell; for I have desired it.
019	PSA	132	015	Her provision will I bless abundantly: her needy ones will I satisfy with bread.
019	PSA	132	016	And her priests will I clothe with salvation: and her pious ones shall shout aloud for joy.
019	PSA	132	017	There will I cause to grow a horn unto David: I arrange a lamp for my anointed.
019	PSA	132	018	His enemies will I clothe with shame; but upon himself shall his crown shine brilliantly.
019	PSA	133	001	“A song of the degrees by David.” Behold, how good and how pleasant it is! when brethren dwell closely together [in union]!
019	PSA	133	002	[It is] like the precious oil upon the head, running down upon the beard, yea, Aaron's beard, which runneth down upon the upper border of his garments;
019	PSA	133	003	Like the dew of Chermon, running down upon the mountains of Zion; for there hath the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore.
019	PSA	134	001	“A song of the degrees.” Arise! bless ye the Lord, all ye servants of the Lord that stand in the house of the Lord in the nights.
019	PSA	134	002	Lift up your hands toward the sanctuary, and bless the Lord.
019	PSA	134	003	May the Lord bless thee out of Zion, he that is the maker of heaven and earth.
019	PSA	135	001	Hallelujah. Praise ye the name of the Lord; praise him, O ye servants of the Lord;
019	PSA	135	002	Ye that stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God.
019	PSA	135	003	Hallelujah; for the Lord is good: sing praises unto his name; for it is lovely.
019	PSA	135	004	For Jacob hath the Lord chosen unto himself, Israel, as his peculiar treasure.
019	PSA	135	005	For I well know that the Lord is great, and that our Lord is above all gods.
019	PSA	135	006	Whatsoever the Lord willeth, hath he done in the heavens, and on the earth, in the seas, and in all the deeps.
019	PSA	135	007	He causeth clouds to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with the rain; he bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries.
019	PSA	135	008	[He it is] who smote the first-born of Egypt, both of man and of cattle;
019	PSA	135	009	Who sent signs and wonderful tokens into the midst of thee, O Egypt, against Pharaoh, and against all his servants;
019	PSA	135	010	Who smote many nations, and slew mighty kings;
019	PSA	135	011	Sichon the king of the Emorites, and 'Og the king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan;
019	PSA	135	012	And gave their land as an inheritance, an inheritance unto Israel his people.
019	PSA	135	013	O Lord, thy name [endureth] for ever: O Lord, thy memorial is throughout all generations.
019	PSA	135	014	For the Lord will espouse the cause of his people, and concerning his servants will he bethink himself.
019	PSA	135	015	The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of the hands of men.
019	PSA	135	016	Mouths they have, but they speak not; eyes they have, but they see not;
019	PSA	135	017	Ears they have, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouth.
019	PSA	135	018	Like them are those that make them, every one that trusteth in them.
019	PSA	135	019	O house of Israel, bless ye the Lord; O house of Aaron, bless ye the Lord.
019	PSA	135	020	O house of Levi, bless ye the Lord; ye that fear the Lord, bless the Lord.
019	PSA	135	021	Blessed be the Lord out of Zion, even he that resideth at Jerusalem. Hallelujah.
019	PSA	136	001	O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good; for to eternity endureth his kindness.
019	PSA	136	002	O give thanks unto the God of gods; for to eternity endureth his kindness.
019	PSA	136	003	O give thanks to the Lord of lords; for to eternity endureth his kindness.
019	PSA	136	004	To him who doth great wonders alone; for to eternity endureth his kindness.
019	PSA	136	005	To him that made the heavens with understanding; for to eternity endureth his kindness.
019	PSA	136	006	To him that stretched out the earth above the waters; for to eternity endureth his kindness.
019	PSA	136	007	To him that made great lights; for to eternity endureth his kindness;
019	PSA	136	008	The sun for the rule by day; for to eternity endureth his kindness;
019	PSA	136	009	The moon and stars for the rule by night; for to eternity endureth his kindness.
019	PSA	136	010	To him that smote Egypt in their first-born; for to eternity endureth his kindness;
019	PSA	136	011	And brought out Israel from the midst of them; for to eternity endureth his kindness;
019	PSA	136	012	With a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm; for to eternity endureth his kindness.
019	PSA	136	013	To him who divided the Red Sea into parts; for to eternity endureth his kindness;
019	PSA	136	014	And caused Israel to pass through the midst of it; for to eternity endureth his kindness;
019	PSA	136	015	But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red Sea; for to eternity endureth his kindness.
019	PSA	136	016	To him who led his people through the wilderness; for to eternity endureth his kindness.
019	PSA	136	017	To him who smote great kings; for to eternity endureth his kindness;
019	PSA	136	018	And slew mighty kings; for to eternity endureth his kindness.
019	PSA	136	019	Even Sichon the king of the Emorites; for to eternity endureth his kindness;
019	PSA	136	020	And 'Og the king of Bashan; for to eternity endureth his kindness;
019	PSA	136	021	And gave their land as an inheritance; for to eternity endureth his kindness;
019	PSA	136	022	As an inheritance unto Israel his servant; for to eternity endureth his kindness;
019	PSA	136	023	Who hath in our low estate remembered us; for to eternity endureth his kindness;
019	PSA	136	024	And hath freed us from our assailants; for to eternity endureth his kindness;
019	PSA	136	025	Who giveth food unto all flesh; for to eternity endureth his kindness.
019	PSA	136	026	O give thanks unto the God of the heavens; for to eternity endureth his kindness.
019	PSA	137	001	By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat, and we also wept when we remembered Zion.
019	PSA	137	002	Upon the willows in her midst had we hung up our harps.
019	PSA	137	003	For there our captors demanded of us the words of song; and those that mocked us, joy, [saying,] Sing for us one of the songs of Zion.
019	PSA	137	004	How should we sing the song of the Lord on the soil of the stranger?
019	PSA	137	005	If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, may my right hand forget—.
019	PSA	137	006	May my tongue cleave to my palate if I do not remember thee: if I recall not Jerusalem at the head of my joy.
019	PSA	137	007	Remember, O Lord, unto the children of Edom the day of Jerusalem; who said, Raze it, raze it, even to her very foundation.
019	PSA	137	008	O daughter of Babylon, who art wasted: happy he, that repayeth thee thy recompense for what thou hast done to us.
019	PSA	137	009	Happy he, that seizeth and dasheth thy babes against the rock.
019	PSA	138	001	“By David.” I will praise thee with my whole heart: before [thee], O God, will I sing praise unto thee.
019	PSA	138	002	I will bow myself down before thy holy temple, and I will thank thy name for thy kindness and for thy truth; for thou hast magnified above all thy name thy promise.
019	PSA	138	003	On the day when I called didst thou answer me, and raise me up with strength in my soul.
019	PSA	138	004	All the kings of the earth will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, when they hear the promises of thy mouth.
019	PSA	138	005	And they will sing on the ways of the Lord; for great is the glory of the Lord.
019	PSA	138	006	For exalted is the Lord, yet doth he regard the lowly; but the proud he punisheth from afar.
019	PSA	138	007	If I should walk in the midst of distress, thou wilt revive me: against the wrath of my enemies wilt thou stretch forth thy hand, and thy right hand will save me.
019	PSA	138	008	The Lord will accomplish [all] in my behalf; O Lord, thy kindness endureth for ever: the works of thy own hands do not abandon.
019	PSA	139	001	“To the chief musician, by David, a psalm.” O Lord! thou hast searched me through, and thou knowest [me].
019	PSA	139	002	Thou indeed knowest my sitting down and my rising up, thou understandest my thinking while yet afar off.
019	PSA	139	003	My walking and my lying down hast thou limited, and with all my ways art thou acquainted.
019	PSA	139	004	For, while there is not a word on my tongue, lo, thou, O Lord, knowest it entirely.
019	PSA	139	005	Behind and before hast thou hedged me in, and thou placest upon me thy hand.
019	PSA	139	006	Too wonderful is such knowledge for me: it is too exalted, I cannot attain unto it.
019	PSA	139	007	Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee away from thy presence?
019	PSA	139	008	If I should ascend into heaven, thou art there; and if I should make my bed in the nether world, behold, thou art there.
019	PSA	139	009	If I should lift up the wings of the morning-dawn, if I should dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea:
019	PSA	139	010	Even there would thy hand lead me, and thy right hand would seize hold of me.
019	PSA	139	011	If I said, Surely darkness shall enshroud me, and into night [be turned] the light about me:
019	PSA	139	012	Yet even darkness can obscure nothing from thee; but the night will shine like the day; both the darkness and the light are alike [to thee].
019	PSA	139	013	For thou possessest my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.
019	PSA	139	014	I will thank thee therefore, that I am [so] fearfully [and] wonderfully made: wonderful are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.
019	PSA	139	015	My being was not concealed from thee, when I was made in secret, when I was [so to say] embroidered in the lowest parts of the earth.
019	PSA	139	016	My undeveloped substance did thy eyes see; and in thy book were all of them written down—the days which have been formed, while yet not one of them was here.
019	PSA	139	017	And how precious are unto me thy thoughts, O God! how mightily great is their sum!
019	PSA	139	018	Should I count them, they would be more numerous than the sand: I awake, and I am still with thee.
019	PSA	139	019	If thou wouldst but slay the wicked, O God! and ye men of blood, depart from me.
019	PSA	139	020	Who speak of thee for a wicked end, thy enemies, that bear [thy name] for a vain purpose.
019	PSA	139	021	Behold, those that hate thee I ever hate, O Lord; and for those that rise up against thee do I feel loathing.
019	PSA	139	022	With the utmost hatred do I hate them: enemies are they become unto me.
019	PSA	139	023	Search me through, O God, and know my heart; probe me, and know my thoughts:
019	PSA	139	024	And see if there be a way of perverseness in me, and lead me on the way of eternity.
019	PSA	140	001	“To the chief musician, a psalm of David.” Deliver me, O Lord, from an evil man; from a man of violence do thou keep me;
019	PSA	140	002	Who think over evil [resolves] in their heart, [who] every day are gathered together for war.
019	PSA	140	003	They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent: the poison of the adder is under their lips. (Selah)
019	PSA	140	004	Preserve me, O Lord, from the hands of the wicked, from the man of violence do thou keep me, who think of overthrowing my steps.
019	PSA	140	005	The proud have hidden a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the side of [my] track; traps have they set for me. (Selah)
019	PSA	140	006	I have said unto the Lord, Thou art my God: give ear, O Lord, to the voice of my supplications.
019	PSA	140	007	O thou Eternal Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head on the day of battle.
019	PSA	140	008	Grant not, O Lord, the longings of the wicked; suffer not his wicked device to succeed: lest they exalt themselves. (Selah)
019	PSA	140	009	[As for] the heads of those that encompass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.
019	PSA	140	010	Let burning coals be cast upon them: let them be thrown into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again.
019	PSA	140	011	Let not the man of an [evil] tongue be established on the earth: may evil hunt down the violent man to his downfall.
019	PSA	140	012	I know that the Lord will procure right for the afflicted, [and] justice for the needy.
019	PSA	140	013	Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright shall dwell before thy presence.
019	PSA	141	001	“A psalm of David.” O Lord, I call thee, hasten unto me: give ear unto my voice, when I call unto thee.
019	PSA	141	002	May my prayer be valued as incense before thee, the lifting up of my hands, as the evening offering.
019	PSA	141	003	Set, O Lord, a watch unto my mouth: keep a guard at the door of my lips.
019	PSA	141	004	Permit not my heart to incline after any evil thing, to practise deeds in wickedness with men that are doers of wrong: and let me not eat of their dainties.
019	PSA	141	005	If the righteous strike me, it is a kindness; and if he reprove me, it is [as] oil poured on the head, my head shall not refuse it; for yet my prayer also [is offered] in their sufferings.
019	PSA	141	006	Are their judges fallen down through means of a rock: then will they listen to my words; for they are pleasant.
019	PSA	141	007	As when one cutteth in and splitteth open the earth: so are our bones scattered for the mouth of the grave.
019	PSA	141	008	For unto thee, O Eternal Lord, are my eyes directed; in thee do I trust: pour not out my life.
019	PSA	141	009	Guard me from the power of the snare which they have laid for me, and the traps of the wrong-doers.
019	PSA	141	010	Let the wicked fall into their own nets, altogether—while I pass safely by.
019	PSA	142	001	“A Maskil of David, when he was in the cave. A prayer.” With my voice I cry unto the Lord: with my voice I make supplication unto the Lord.
019	PSA	142	002	I pour out before him my grief: my distress I recite before him.
019	PSA	142	003	When my spirit was overwhelmed within me—and thou knowest well my path—on the way whereon I desired to walk they had secretly laid a snare for me.
019	PSA	142	004	Look to the right, and behold, yea, there is no man that recognizeth me: [every] refuge is lost to me; there is no one that careth for my soul.
019	PSA	142	005	I cried unto thee, O Lord: I said, Thou art my refuge, my portion in the land of life.
019	PSA	142	006	Listen unto my entreaty; for I am very miserable: deliver me from my pursuers; for they are too mighty for me.
019	PSA	142	007	Bring forth out of prison my soul, that I may thank thy name: with me shall the righteous crown themselves, when thou wilt deal bountifully with me.
019	PSA	143	001	“A psalm of David.” O Lord, hear my prayer, give ear to my supplications: in thy faithfulness answer me, in thy righteousness.
019	PSA	143	002	And enter not into judgment with thy servant; for no living man can be regarded righteous before thee.
019	PSA	143	003	For the enemy hath pursued my soul; he hath crushed to the ground my life; he hath made me dwell in darkness, as those that are dead eternally.
019	PSA	143	004	And my spirit within me is overwhelmed: in my bosom is my heart astounded.
019	PSA	143	005	I remember the days of olden times: I meditate on all thy doings: on the work of thy hands do I reflect.
019	PSA	143	006	I spread forth my hands unto thee: my soul [longeth] for thee, as a thirsty land. (Selah)
019	PSA	143	007	Hasten, answer me, O Lord, my spirit falleth: hide not thy face from me, that I may not become like those that go down into the pit.
019	PSA	143	008	Cause me to hear in the morning thy kindness; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way whereon I should walk; for unto thee do I lift up my soul.
019	PSA	143	009	Deliver me, O Lord, from my enemies: by thee do I seek shelter.
019	PSA	143	010	Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit is good; guide me on a level land.
019	PSA	143	011	For thy sake, O Lord, revive me: in thy righteousness bring forth out of distress my soul.
019	PSA	143	012	And in thy kindness destroy my enemies, and annihilate all the adversaries of my soul; far I am thy servant.
019	PSA	144	001	“By David.” Blessed be the Lord my Rock, who exerciseth my hands for the battle, my fingers for the war:
019	PSA	144	002	My kindness, and my strong-hold; my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me.
019	PSA	144	003	Lord, what is man, that thou takest cognizance of him: the son of a mortal, that thou regardest him!
019	PSA	144	004	Man is like the breath: his days are like a passing shadow.
019	PSA	144	005	O Lord, bend thy heavens, and come down: touch the mountains, that they may smoke.
019	PSA	144	006	Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: send out thy arrows, and confound them.
019	PSA	144	007	Stretch out thy hands from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of the children of the stranger.
019	PSA	144	008	Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and whose right hand is the right hand of falsehood.
019	PSA	144	009	O God, a new song will I sing unto thee: upon the ten-stringed psaltery will I sing praises unto thee.
019	PSA	144	010	[Thou art he] that giveth victory unto kings: who riddeth David his servant from the evil-bringing sword.
019	PSA	144	011	Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of the children of the stranger, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and whose right hand is the right hand of falsehood.
019	PSA	144	012	So that our sons may be like plants, grown up in their youth: our daughters, like corner-pillars, sculptured in the model of a palace.
019	PSA	144	013	May our garners be full, furnishing all manner of store: our sheep bringing forth thousands and ten thousands in our open pastures.
019	PSA	144	014	May our oxen be strong to labor: may there be no breach, nor migration, nor loud complaint in our streets.
019	PSA	144	015	Happy the people, that fare thus: happy the people, whose God is the Lord.
019	PSA	145	001	“A hymn of praise by David.” I will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever.
019	PSA	145	002	Every day will I bless thee, and I will praise thy name for ever and ever.
019	PSA	145	003	Great is the Lord, and greatly praised, and his greatness is unsearchable.
019	PSA	145	004	One generation shall praise thy works to the other, and thy mighty acts shall they declare.
019	PSA	145	005	On the majestic glory of thy excellence, and on thy wondrous deeds will I meditate.
019	PSA	145	006	And of the might of thy terrible acts shall men converse: and thy greatness will I relate.
019	PSA	145	007	The memorial of thy abundant goodness shall they loudly proclaim, and they shall sing joyfully of thy righteousness.
019	PSA	145	008	Gracious and merciful is the Lord, long-suffering, and great in kindness.
019	PSA	145	009	The Lord is good to all, and his mercies are over all his works.
019	PSA	145	010	All thy works shall thank thee, O Lord; and thy pious servants shall bless thee.
019	PSA	145	011	Of the glory of thy kingdom shall they converse, and of thy might shall they speak:
019	PSA	145	012	To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.
019	PSA	145	013	Thy kingdom is a kingdom of all eternities, and thy dominion [subsisteth] throughout all generations.
019	PSA	145	014	The Lord upholdeth all who are falling, and raiseth up all those who are bowed down.
019	PSA	145	015	The eyes of all wait hopefully upon thee, and thou givest them their food in its due season.
019	PSA	145	016	Thou openest thy hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing.
019	PSA	145	017	Righteous is the Lord in all his ways, and beneficent in all his works.
019	PSA	145	018	The Lord is nigh unto all those who call on him, to all who call on him in truth.
019	PSA	145	019	The desire of those who fear him will he fulfill, and their cry will he hear, and save them.
019	PSA	145	020	The Lord preserveth all those who love him; but all the wicked will he destroy.
019	PSA	145	021	The praise of the Lord shall my mouth speak: and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.
019	PSA	146	001	Hallelujah. Praise, O my soul, the Lord.
019	PSA	146	002	I will praise the Lord throughout my life: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.
019	PSA	146	003	Put not your trust in princes, in the son of man, in whom there is no salvation.
019	PSA	146	004	When his spirit goeth forth, he returneth to his [native] earth: on that very day perish his thoughts.
019	PSA	146	005	[But] happy is he who hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is on the Lord his God;
019	PSA	146	006	Who hath made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that is therein; who keepeth truth for ever;
019	PSA	146	007	Who executeth justice for the oppressed: who giveth bread to the hungry: the Lord looseneth the prisoners;
019	PSA	146	008	The Lord causeth the blind to see; the Lord raiseth up those who are bowed down; the Lord loveth the righteous:
019	PSA	146	009	The Lord guardeth the strangers; the fatherless and widow he helpeth up; but the way of the wicked he maketh crooked.
019	PSA	146	010	The Lord will reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Hallelujah.
019	PSA	147	001	Hallelujah; for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for it is comely; [him] becometh praise.
019	PSA	147	002	The Lord buildeth up Jerusalem: the outcasts of Israel will he gather together;
019	PSA	147	003	He that healeth the broken-hearted, and bindeth up their hurts;
019	PSA	147	004	Who counteth the number of the stars; who calleth them all by [their] names.

019	PSA	147	007	Lift up a song unto the Lord with thanksgiving; sing praises unto our God with the harp;
019	PSA	147	008	Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who causeth grass to grow upon the mountains;
019	PSA	147	009	Who giveth to the beast its food, to the young ravens which cry.
019	PSA	147	010	Not in the strength of the horse hath he delight: nor in the [swiftness of the] legs of man taketh he pleasure.

019	PSA	147	015	He who sendeth forth his decree unto the earth: how swiftly speedeth his word along!
019	PSA	147	016	He who dispenseth snow like wool; who streweth about the hoarfrost like ashes;
019	PSA	147	017	He who casteth down his ice like pieces: before his cold who can stand?
019	PSA	147	018	He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to blow, and waters run along.
019	PSA	147	019	He declareth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his ordinances unto Israel.
019	PSA	147	020	He hath not done so unto any nation: and [his] ordinances— these they know not. Hallelujah.

019	PSA	150	005	Praise him upon the clear-ringing cymbals: praise him upon the high-sounding cymbals.
019	PSA	150	006	Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord. Hallelujah.

# BOOK	020	PRO	Proverbs	Proverbs
020	PRO	001	001	The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, the king of Israel:
020	PRO	001	002	To know wisdom and instruction; to comprehend the sayings of understanding;
020	PRO	001	003	To accept the instruction of intelligence, righteousness, and justice, and equity;
020	PRO	001	004	To give to the simple prudence, to the youth knowledge and discretion.
020	PRO	001	005	The wise will hear, and will increase [his] information; and the man of understanding will obtain wise counsels:
020	PRO	001	006	To understand a proverb, and a sage sentence; the words of the wise, and their riddles.
020	PRO	001	007	The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: wisdom and instruction fools [alone] despise.
020	PRO	001	008	Hear, my son, the instruction of thy father, and cast not off the teaching of thy mother;
020	PRO	001	009	For a wreath of grace are they unto thy head, and chains for thy throat.
020	PRO	001	010	My son, if sinners wish to entice thee, consent thou not.
020	PRO	001	011	If they should say, Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood, let us watch in concealment for the uselessly innocent;
020	PRO	001	012	We will swallow them up like the grave alive; and the men of integrity, as those that go down into the pit;
020	PRO	001	013	We shall find all [kinds of] precious wealth, we will fill our houses with booty;
020	PRO	001	014	Thy lot must thou cast in our midst; one purse shall be for us all:
020	PRO	001	015	My son, walk not thou on the way with them; withhold thy foot from their path;
020	PRO	001	016	For their feet run after evil, and they make haste to shed blood.
020	PRO	001	017	For uselessly is the net spread out before the eyes of every winged bird:
020	PRO	001	018	While they lie in wait for their [own] blood; they watch in concealment for their [own] lives.
020	PRO	001	019	So are the paths of every one that is greedy after [unlawful] gain; it taketh away the life of those that own it.
020	PRO	001	020	Wisdom crieth loudly without; in the public places she uttereth her voice;
020	PRO	001	021	At the corner of noisy streets she calleth, at the entrances of gates; in the city she sayeth her speeches:
020	PRO	001	022	How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners take their delight in scorning, and fools hate knowledge?
020	PRO	001	023	Turn back to my admonition: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.
020	PRO	001	024	Whereas I called, and ye refused; I stretched out my hand, and no man was attentive;
020	PRO	001	025	And ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would not accept my admonition:
020	PRO	001	026	[Therefore] I also will truly laugh at your calamity; I will deride [you] when your terror cometh;
020	PRO	001	027	When your terror cometh like the tempest-cloud, and your calamity hasteneth like a whirlwind; when there come upon you distress and affliction.
020	PRO	001	028	Then will they call me, but I will not answer; they will seek me earnestly, but they shall not find me;
020	PRO	001	029	For the reason that they hated knowledge, and the fear of the Lord they did not choose;
020	PRO	001	030	[That] they would not attend to my counsel: [that] they rejected all my admonition.
020	PRO	001	031	Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and from their own counsels shall they be satisfied.
020	PRO	001	032	For the defection of the simple will slay them, and the prosperity of fools will cause them to be lost.
020	PRO	001	033	But he that hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be at rest from the dread of evil.
020	PRO	002	001	My son, if thou wouldst but accept my words, and treasure up my commandments with thee;
020	PRO	002	002	To let thy ear listen unto wisdom: [if] thou wouldst incline thy heart to understanding.
020	PRO	002	003	For if thou wilt call after intelligence; if after understanding thou wilt lift up thy voice;
020	PRO	002	004	If thou wilt seek her as silver, and search for her as for hidden treasures:
020	PRO	002	005	Then wilt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and the knowledge of God wilt thou find.
020	PRO	002	006	For the Lord giveth wisdom: out of his mouth [come] knowledge and understanding.
020	PRO	002	007	He treasureth up sound wisdom for the righteous, as a shield to those that walk in integrity:
020	PRO	002	008	That men may keep the paths of justice; and the way of his pious servants doth he guard.
020	PRO	002	009	Then wilt thou understand righteousness, and justice, and equity: yea, every track of goodness.
020	PRO	002	010	For wisdom will enter thy heart, and knowledge will be pleasant unto thy soul;
020	PRO	002	011	Discretion will watch over thee, understanding will keep thee;
020	PRO	002	012	To deliver thee from the way of the bad, from the man that speaketh perverse things;
020	PRO	002	013	[From those] who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;
020	PRO	002	014	Who rejoice to do evil, who are delighted in the perverseness of the bad;
020	PRO	002	015	Who as regardeth their paths are crooked, and froward in their tracks.
020	PRO	002	016	To deliver thee from the adulteress, from the alien woman that useth flattering speeches;
020	PRO	002	017	That forsaketh the friend of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.
020	PRO	002	018	For she sinketh unto death—her house, and unto the departed [lead] her tracks.
020	PRO	002	019	All that come unto her return not again, and they will not reach the paths of life.
020	PRO	002	020	In order that thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and observe the paths of the righteous.
020	PRO	002	021	For the upright will dwell on the earth, and the perfect will be left remaining on it.
020	PRO	002	022	But the wicked will be cut off from the earth, and the treacherous shall be plucked up therefrom.
020	PRO	003	001	My son, forget not my teaching, and let thy heart keep my commandments;
020	PRO	003	002	For length of days, and years of life, and peace, will they increase unto thee.
020	PRO	003	003	Let kindness and truth not forsake thee; bind them about thy throat; write them upon the table of thy heart:
020	PRO	003	004	So shalt thou find grace and good favor in the eyes of God and man.
020	PRO	003	005	Trust in the Lord with all thy heart: and upon thy own understanding do not rely.
020	PRO	003	006	In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he will make level thy paths.
020	PRO	003	007	Be not wise in thy own eyes: fear the Lord, and depart from evil.
020	PRO	003	008	It will be healing to thy body, and marrow to thy bones.
020	PRO	003	009	Honor the Lord with thy wealth, and with the first-fruits of all thy products:
020	PRO	003	010	So shall thy storehouses be filled with plenty, and with new wine shall thy presses overflow.
020	PRO	003	011	The correction of the Lord, my son, do not despise; and feel no loathing for his admonition;
020	PRO	003	012	Because whomever the Lord loveth he admonisheth; and as a father who delighteth in [his] son.
020	PRO	003	013	Happy the man that hath found wisdom, and the man that acquireth understanding.
020	PRO	003	014	For the obtaining of her is better than the obtaining of silver, and better than fine gold is her product.
020	PRO	003	015	She is more precious than pearls; and all the things thou valuest are not equal unto her.
020	PRO	003	016	Length of days is in her right hand: in her left are riches and honor.
020	PRO	003	017	Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.
020	PRO	003	018	A tree of life is she to those that lay hold on her: and every one that firmly graspeth her will be made happy.
020	PRO	003	019	The Lord hath through wisdom founded the earth: he hath established the heavens through understanding.
020	PRO	003	020	By his knowledge were the depths split open, and the skies drop down the dew.
020	PRO	003	021	My son, let them not be removed from thy eyes; keep [before thee] sound wisdom and discretion:
020	PRO	003	022	And they will be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy throat.
020	PRO	003	023	Then wilt thou walk in safety on thy way, and thy foot will not strike [against aught]:
020	PRO	003	024	When thou layest thyself down, thou shalt feel no dread; and as thou liest down, thy sleep shall be pleasant.
020	PRO	003	025	Thou needest not to be afraid of sudden dread, neither of the [unlooked-for] tempest over the wicked, when it cometh.
020	PRO	003	026	For the Lord will be thy confidence, and he will guard thy foot from being caught.
020	PRO	003	027	Withhold not a benefit from him who is deserving it, when it is in the power of thy hand to do it.
020	PRO	003	028	Say not unto thy neighbor, Go, and return, and tomorrow will I give: when thou hast it by thee.
020	PRO	003	029	Contrive not against thy neighbor any evil, when he dwelleth in safety with thee.
020	PRO	003	030	Quarrel not with any man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.
020	PRO	003	031	Envy not the man of violence, and choose none of his ways.
020	PRO	003	032	For the froward is an abomination to the Lord; but with the upright is his good-will.
020	PRO	003	033	The curse of the Lord is in the house of the wicked; but the habitation of the righteous will he bless.
020	PRO	003	034	If [it concern] the scornful he will himself render them a scorn; but unto the lowly doth he give grace.
020	PRO	003	035	The wise shall inherit glory; but fools shall obtain disgrace as their portion.
020	PRO	004	001	Hear, ye children, the correction of a father, and attend to know understanding.
020	PRO	004	002	For good information do I give you: my teaching must ye not forsake.
020	PRO	004	003	For I was a son unto my father, a tender and an only child before my mother.
020	PRO	004	004	And he instructed me, and said unto me, Let thy heart grasp firmly my words: observe my commandments and live.
020	PRO	004	005	Acquire wisdom, acquire understanding: forget not, and depart not from the sayings of my mouth.
020	PRO	004	006	Forsake her not, and she will watch over thee: love her, and she will keep thee.
020	PRO	004	007	The beginning of wisdom is, Acquire wisdom: and with all thy acquisition acquire understanding.
020	PRO	004	008	Hold her in high esteem, and she will exalt thee: she will bring thee to honor, when thou embracest her.
020	PRO	004	009	She will give to thy head a wreath of grace: a crown of ornament will she deliver to thee.
020	PRO	004	010	Hear, O my son, and accept my sayings: and they will increase unto thee the years of life.
020	PRO	004	011	In the way of wisdom have I instructed thee: I have led thee in the tracks of uprightness.
020	PRO	004	012	When thou walkest, thy step shall not be narrowed; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.
020	PRO	004	013	Lay fast hold of correction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life.
020	PRO	004	014	Enter not into the path of the wicked, and step not on the way of the bad.
020	PRO	004	015	Avoid it, pass not through by it, turn off from it, and pass away.
020	PRO	004	016	For they sleep not, except they have done evil, and their sleep is robbed away, unless they cause some to stumble.
020	PRO	004	017	For they eat the bread of wickedness; and the wine of violence do they drink.
020	PRO	004	018	But the path of the righteous is as the early morning light, that shineth more and more brightly until the height of noonday.
020	PRO	004	019	The way of the wicked is like darkness: they know not against what they stumble.
020	PRO	004	020	My son, attend to my words, unto my sayings incline thy ear.
020	PRO	004	021	Let them not slip away from thy eyes: guard them in the midst of thy heart.
020	PRO	004	022	For they are life unto every one of those that find them, and to all his body a healing.
020	PRO	004	023	Above all that is to be guarded, keep thy heart, for out of it are the issues of life.
020	PRO	004	024	Remove from thee frowardness of mouth; and perverseness of lips put away far from thee.
020	PRO	004	025	Let thy eyes look right forward, and let thy eyelids see straight out before thee.
020	PRO	004	026	Balance well the track of thy foot, and let all thy ways be firmly right.
020	PRO	004	027	Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.
020	PRO	005	001	My son, attend unto my wisdom; to my understanding incline thou thy ear:
020	PRO	005	002	That thou mayest observe discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge.
020	PRO	005	003	For as of fine honey drop the lips of an adulterous woman, and smoother than oil is her palate;
020	PRO	005	004	But her end is bitter as wormwood, it is sharp as a two-edged sword.
020	PRO	005	005	Her feet go down to death, her steps take firm hold on the nether world:
020	PRO	005	006	So that she cannot balance the path of life; her tracks are unsteady, and she knoweth it not.
020	PRO	005	007	And now, O ye children, hearken unto me, and depart not from the sayings of my mouth.
020	PRO	005	008	Remove far from her thy way, and come not nigh to the door of her house;
020	PRO	005	009	That thou mayest not give up unto others thy vigor, and thy years unto the cruel;
020	PRO	005	010	That strangers may not satisfy themselves with thy strength, and with thy exertions, in the house of an alien:
020	PRO	005	011	While thou moanest at thy end, when thy flesh and thy body are coming to their end,
020	PRO	005	012	And thou sayest, How have I hated correction, and how hath my heart rejected reproof;
020	PRO	005	013	While I hearkened not to the voice of my instructors, and to my teachers I inclined not my ear;
020	PRO	005	014	But little more was wanting, and I had been in all [kinds of] unhappiness in the midst of the congregation and assembly.
020	PRO	005	015	Drink water out of thy own cistern, and running waters out of thy own well.
020	PRO	005	016	So will thy springs overflow abroad; and in the open streets will be thy rivulets of water;
020	PRO	005	017	They will be thy own only, and not those of strangers with thee.
020	PRO	005	018	Thy fountain will be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth, —
020	PRO	005	019	The lovely gazelle and the graceful chamois: let her bosom satisfy thee abundantly at all times; with her love be thou ravished continually.
020	PRO	005	020	And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with an adulteress, and embrace the bosom of an alien woman?
020	PRO	005	021	For before the eyes of the Lord are the ways of man, and all his tracks doth he weigh in the balance.
020	PRO	005	022	His own iniquities will truly catch the wicked, and with the cords of his sin will he be held firmly.
020	PRO	005	023	He will indeed die for want of correction; and through the abundance of his folly will he sink into error.
020	PRO	006	001	My son, If thou hast become surety for thy friend, if thou hast struck thy hand for a stranger;
020	PRO	006	002	If thou art ensnared through the words of thy mouth, if thou art caught through the words of thy mouth:
020	PRO	006	003	[Then] do this by all means, my son, and deliver thyself, because thou art come into the power of thy friend, Go hasten to him, and urge thy friend.
020	PRO	006	004	Grant not any sleep to thy eyes, nor slumber to thy eyelids.
020	PRO	006	005	Deliver thyself as a roebuck from the hand [of the hunter], and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.
020	PRO	006	006	Go to the ant, thou sluggard; look on her ways, and become wise.
020	PRO	006	007	She, that hath no prince, officer, or ruler,
020	PRO	006	008	Provideth in the summer her provision, gathereth in harvest-time her food.
020	PRO	006	009	How long, O sluggard, wilt thou lie down? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?
020	PRO	006	010	“A little [more] sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands in lying down;”
020	PRO	006	011	But then will thy poverty come like a rover, and thy want as a man armed with a shield.
020	PRO	006	012	A Godless person is a man of injustice, who walketh with a distorted mouth.
020	PRO	006	013	He blinketh with his eyes, he scrapeth with his feet, he pointeth with his fingers;
020	PRO	006	014	Perverseness is in his heart, he contriveth evil at all times; he scattereth abroad discord.
020	PRO	006	015	Therefore shall suddenly come his calamity: unawares shalt he be broken without a remedy.
020	PRO	006	016	Six things there are which the Lord hateth; and seven are an abomination unto his spirit:
020	PRO	006	017	Haughty eyes, a tongue of falsehood, and hands that shed innocent blood,
020	PRO	006	018	A heart that contriveth plans of injustice, feet that hasten to run after evil,
020	PRO	006	019	A false witness that eagerly uttereth lies, and him that scattereth abroad discord among brethren.
020	PRO	006	020	Keep, O my son, the commandment of thy father, and reject not the teaching of thy mother:
020	PRO	006	021	Bind them upon thy heart continually, tie them about thy throat.
020	PRO	006	022	When thou walkest, it shall lead thee; when thou liest down, it shall watch over thee; and when thou art awake, it shall converse with thee.
020	PRO	006	023	For the commandment is a lamp, and the law is light; and the way of life are the admonitions of correction:
020	PRO	006	024	To guard thee against a bad woman, from the flattery of an alien tongue.
020	PRO	006	025	Covet not her beauty in thy heart, and let her not conquer thee with her eyelids.
020	PRO	006	026	For by means of a harlot [one is brought down] to the last loaf of bread: and an adulterous woman will even hunt for the precious life,
020	PRO	006	027	Can a man gather up fire in his lap, and shall his clothes not be burnt?
020	PRO	006	028	Can a man walk along upon hot coals, and shall his feet not be burnt?
020	PRO	006	029	So it is with him that goeth in to his neighbor's wife: no one that toucheth her shall remain unpunished.
020	PRO	006	030	Men do not despise the thief, if he steal, to gratify his craving when he is hungry:

020	PRO	030	020	Such is the way of an adulterous woman: she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wrong.
020	PRO	030	021	Under three things the earth trembleth, and under four which she cannot bear:
020	PRO	030	022	Under a servant when he becometh king, and a worthless fool when he hath eaten enough bread;
020	PRO	030	023	Under an odious woman when she is married, and a bond-woman when she dispossesseth her mistress.
020	PRO	030	024	There are four which are the little ones of the earth, and they are nevertheless exceedingly wise:
020	PRO	030	025	The ants are a people not strong, therefore do they prepare in the summer their food;
020	PRO	030	026	The conies are but a feeble people, therefore do they place on the rocks their houses;
020	PRO	030	027	The locusts have no king, and yet they go forth in troops altogether;
020	PRO	030	028	The spider thou canst catch with [thy] hands, and yet she is in the palaces of a king.
020	PRO	030	029	Three there are that have a stately step, and four, that are stately in going:
020	PRO	030	030	The lion, the mightiest among beasts, who turneth not round from before any one;
020	PRO	030	031	The light-legged greyhound, and the he-goat; and a king, against whom there is no rising up.
020	PRO	030	032	If thou hast become degraded by lifting up thyself, or if thou hast devised evil, put thy hand to thy mouth:
020	PRO	030	033	For the pressure of milk bringeth forth butter, and the pressure of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the pressure of wrath bringeth forth strife.
020	PRO	031	001	The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy with which his mother instructed him.
020	PRO	031	002	What [hast thou done], O my son: and what, O son of my body? and what, O son of my vows?
020	PRO	031	003	Give not unto women thy vigor, nor thy ways to those that ruin kings.
020	PRO	031	004	Not for kings, O Lemoel, not for kings [it is fitting] to drink wine, nor for princes, strong drink:
020	PRO	031	005	Lest either might drink, and forget what is written in the law, and pervert the cause of all the afflicted.
020	PRO	031	006	Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those who have an embittered soul.
020	PRO	031	007	Let such a one drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his trouble no more.

020	PRO	031	016	She thinketh of a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.
020	PRO	031	017	She girdeth with strength her loins, and giveth vigor to her arms.

020	PRO	031	021	She hath no fear for her household of the snow: for all her household are clothed in scarlet.
020	PRO	031	022	Tapestry-covering she maketh for herself: of linen and purple is her attire.
020	PRO	031	023	Well known is in the gates her husband, when he sitteth with the elders of the land.
020	PRO	031	024	Fine tunics she maketh, and selleth them, and girdles she furnisheth unto the merchant.
020	PRO	031	025	Strength and dignity are her clothing: and she smileth at the coming of the last day.
020	PRO	031	026	She openeth her mouth with wisdom, and the law of kindness is on her tongue.
020	PRO	031	027	She looketh well to the ways of her household, and the bread of idleness she doth not eat.
020	PRO	031	028	Her children rise up, and call her blessed; her husband, also, and he praiseth her:
020	PRO	031	029	“Many daughters have done virtuously; but thou excellest them all.”
020	PRO	031	030	False is grace, and vain is beauty: a woman only that feareth the Lord shall indeed be praised.
020	PRO	031	031	Give her of the fruit of her hands, and let her own works praise her in the gates.

# BOOK	021	ECC	Ecclesiastes	Ecclesiastes
021	ECC	001	001	The words of Koheleth, the son of David, the king in Jerusalem.
021	ECC	001	002	Vanity of vanities, saith Koheleth, vanity of vanities: all is vanity.
021	ECC	001	003	What profit hath a man of all his toil which he toil-eth under the sun?
021	ECC	001	004	One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh; but the earth endureth for ever.
021	ECC	001	005	The sun also riseth, and the sun goeth down, and striving to reach his place he riseth again there.
021	ECC	001	006	Going toward the south, and turning round toward the north, the wind moveth round about continually; and around its circles doth the wind return again.
021	ECC	001	007	All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is never full: unto the place whither the rivers go, thither will they continue to go.
021	ECC	001	008	All things weary themselves [constantly]; man can not utter them: the eye is never satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.
021	ECC	001	009	That which hath been, is the same which will be; and that which hath been done, is the same which will be done; and there is nothing new under the sun.
021	ECC	001	010	If there be any thing whereof it is said, See, this is new: It hath already been in olden times which were before us.
021	ECC	001	011	[Only] there is no recollection of former [generations]; and also of the later ones, that are to be—of these [likewise] there will be no recollection with those that will be still later.
021	ECC	001	012	I Koheleth was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
021	ECC	001	013	And I directed my heart to inquire and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under the heavens: this is an evil employment which God hath given to the sons of man to busy themselves therewith.
021	ECC	001	014	I saw all the deeds that are done under the sun: and, behold, all is vanity and a torture of the spirit.
021	ECC	001	015	What is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is defective cannot be numbered.
021	ECC	001	016	I spoke with my own heart, saying, Lo, I have truly obtained greater and more wisdom than all those who have been before me over Jerusalem: yea, my heart had seen much wisdom and knowledge.
021	ECC	001	017	And I directed my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly; [but] I have perceived that this also is a torture of the spirit.
021	ECC	001	018	For where there is much wisdom there is much vexation: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth pain.
021	ECC	002	001	Come, then, I said in my heart, I will have a taste of joy, and thou shalt see what is good; but, behold, this also was vanity.
021	ECC	002	002	Of laughter I said, It maketh one mad: and of joy, What doth this do?
021	ECC	002	003	I resolved in my heart to indulge my body with wine, while my heart guideth itself with wisdom; and to lay fast hold on folly, till I might see what it is that is good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heavens during the number of the days of their life.
021	ECC	002	004	I made great works: I built myself houses; I planted myself vineyards;
021	ECC	002	005	I made myself gardens and orchards, and I planted therein trees of all kinds of fruit;
021	ECC	002	006	I made myself pools of water, to water therewith the forest overgrown with trees;
021	ECC	002	007	I bought men-servants and maid-servants, and I had likewise those born in my house; I had also great possessions of cattle and flocks above all that had been before me in Jerusalem.
021	ECC	002	008	I gathered unto myself also silver and gold, and the choice treasures of kings and of the provinces: I procured myself male singers and female singers, and the delights of the sons of men, wagons and chariots.
021	ECC	002	009	So was I great, and obtained more than all that had been before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.
021	ECC	002	010	And whatsoever my eyes desired I refused them not; I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart was rejoiced with all my toil, and this was my portion of all my toil.
021	ECC	002	011	But when I turned myself [to look] on all my works that my hands had wrought, and on the toil that I had toiled to accomplish: then, behold, all was vanity and a torture of the spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.
021	ECC	002	012	And then I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly; for what [can] the man [do] that cometh after the king? [only] that which [others] have done already.
021	ECC	002	013	But I saw indeed that wisdom hath the advantage over folly, as great as the advantage of light over darkness.
021	ECC	002	014	The wise man hath his eyes in his head, while the fool walketh in darkness; but I myself perceived then also that one occurrence will befall all of them.
021	ECC	002	015	Then said I in my heart, The same that befalleth the fool will also befall even me: and why have I then been wiser? Then spoke I in my heart, that this is also vanity.
021	ECC	002	016	For there is no recollection of the wise any more than of the fool for ever: seeing that which hath long ago been will, in the days that are coming, all be forgotten. And how doth the wise die equally with the fool!
021	ECC	002	017	Therefore I hated life; because I felt displeased with the work that is wrought under the sun; for all is vanity and a torture of the spirit.
021	ECC	002	018	Yea, I hated also all my toil with which I had toiled under the sun; because I should have to leave it unto the man that will be after me.
021	ECC	002	019	And who knoweth, whether he will be a wise man or a fool? yet will he have full sway over all my toil wherein I have toiled, and wherein I have shown myself wise under the sun. Also this is vanity.
021	ECC	002	020	Therefore I turned about to cause my heart to give up thinking of all the toil wherewith I had toiled under the sun.
021	ECC	002	021	For there is many a man whose toil is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and with energy; yet to a man that hath not toiled therefore must he give it as his portion. Also this is vanity and a great evil.
021	ECC	002	022	For what doth a man obtain of all his toil, and of the torture of his heart, wherewith he toileth under the sun?
021	ECC	002	023	For all his days are full of pains, and vexation is [mingled with] his employment: yea, even in the night his heart taketh not rest. Also this is vanity.
021	ECC	002	024	It is not a good thing [inherent] in man that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy happiness for his toil. Also this have I seen, that it cometh out of the hand of God.
021	ECC	002	025	For who can well eat, or who can enjoy earthly things more than I?
021	ECC	002	026	For to a man who is good in his presence [God] giveth wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he giveth employment, to gather up and to bring together, that he may give it to him that is good before God. Also this is vanity and a torture of the spirit.
021	ECC	003	001	For every thing there is a season; and a [proper] time is for every pursuit under the heavens.
021	ECC	003	002	[There is] a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up what hath been planted;
021	ECC	003	003	A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;
021	ECC	003	004	A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;
021	ECC	003	005	A time to throw away stones, and a time to gather up stones; a time to embrace, and a time to be far from embracing;
021	ECC	003	006	A time to seek, and a time to let things be lost; a time to keep, and a time to throw away;
021	ECC	003	007	A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;
021	ECC	003	008	A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.
021	ECC	003	009	What profit hath [now] he that worketh in that wherein he toileth?
021	ECC	003	010	I have seen the employment, which God hath given to the sons of men to busy themselves therewith.
021	ECC	003	011	Every thing hath he made beautiful in its [proper] time: he hath also placed the eternity in their heart, without a man's being able to find out the work that God hath made from the beginning to the end.
021	ECC	003	012	I know that there is nothing good [inherent] in them, but for every one to rejoice and to do what is good during [all] his life.
021	ECC	003	013	For also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy what is good for all his toil, is likewise a gift of God.
021	ECC	003	014	I know that whatsoever God doth, that will be for ever; to it nothing can be added, and from it there is nothing to be diminished: and God hath so made it, that men should be afraid of him.
021	ECC	003	015	That which hath been hath long since appeared [again]; and what is to be hath already been; and God seeketh [again] that which is sped away.
021	ECC	003	016	And moreover I have seen under the sun, [that in] the place of justice, even there was wickedness; and [that in] the place of righteousness, even there was wickedness.
021	ECC	003	017	I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the wicked; for there is a time for every pursuit; and on account of every deed there [will he judge].
021	ECC	003	018	I said in my heart concerning the speaking of the sons of men, that God might make it clear to them, and that they might see that they by themselves are but beasts.
021	ECC	003	019	For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even the same thing befalleth them; as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one kind of spirit: so that the preeminence of man above the beast is nought; for all is vanity.
021	ECC	003	020	Every thing goeth unto one place: every thing came from the dust, and every thing returneth to the dust.
021	ECC	003	021	Who knoweth the spirit of the sons of man that ascendeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that descendeth downward to the earth?
021	ECC	003	022	And so did I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion; for who can bring him to look with pleasure on what will be after him?
021	ECC	004	001	And I turned about, and beheld all the oppressed that are made so under the sun: and, behold, there are the tears of the oppressed, and they have no comforter; and from the hand of their oppressors they suffer violence; and they have no comforter.
021	ECC	004	002	Thereupon praised I the dead that are already dead, more than the living who are still alive;
021	ECC	004	003	And as happier than both of them, him who hath not yet come into being, who hath not seen the evil-doing that is done under the sun.—
021	ECC	004	004	Again, I beheld all the toil, and all the energy in doing, that it is [from] the envy of one man of his neighbor. Also this is vanity and a torture of the spirit.
021	ECC	004	005	The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.
021	ECC	004	006	Better is a handful of quiet, than both the hands full of toil and torture of spirit.
021	ECC	004	007	Then I turned about, and I saw a vanity under the sun.
021	ECC	004	008	There is one alone, and he hath not a companion; yea, he hath neither son nor brother: yet is there no end to all his toil; his eye also is not satisfied with riches. Yet for whom do I toil, and deprive my soul of good? Also this is vanity, yea, it is a bad employment.
021	ECC	004	009	Two are better than one; because they will have a good reward for their toil.
021	ECC	004	010	For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to the single one that falleth; for he hath no companion to lift him up.
021	ECC	004	011	Also, if two lie together, then will they become warm; but how can one person alone become warm?
021	ECC	004	012	And if a man could overpower him, the single one, two would stand up against him: and a threefold cord cannot quickly be torn asunder.
021	ECC	004	013	Better is a poor and a wise youth than an old and foolish king, who knoweth not how to be admonished any more.
021	ECC	004	014	For out of the prison cometh the one to reign: whereas also in his kingdom the other becometh poor.
021	ECC	004	015	I have seen all the living who walk under the sun, being with the second child that is to stand up in his stead.
021	ECC	004	016	There was no end to all the people, [belonging] to all that have been before them: they also that come after will not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a torture of the spirit.—
021	ECC	005	001	Watch thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be near to hearken [to his will], more than to give the sacrifice of fools; for they consider not that they do evil [to themselves].
021	ECC	005	002	Suffer not thy mouth to be rash, and let thy heart not be hasty to utter any word before God; for God is in the heavens, and thou art upon the earth: therefore let thy words be few.
021	ECC	005	003	For a dream cometh through being much employed [with something], and the voice of a fool cometh with a multitude of words.
021	ECC	005	004	When thou makest a vow unto God, do not delay to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in such fools: that which thou hast vowed must thou pay.
021	ECC	005	005	It is better that thou shouldst not vow, than that thou shouldst vow and not pay.
021	ECC	005	006	Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy body to sin; and say thou not before the messenger, that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry because of thy voice, and destroy the work of thy hands?
021	ECC	005	007	For in the multitude of dreams and vanities there are also many words; but rather fear thou God.
021	ECC	005	008	If thou see the oppression of the poor, and violence done to justice and righteousness in a province, do not feel astounded at the matter; for one that is high watcheth over the high; and over them, the highest Power.
021	ECC	005	009	But the advantage of a land in all things is, a king who is subject to the country.
021	ECC	005	010	He that loveth money will never be satisfied with money; nor he that loveth abundance, with any increase. Also this is vanity.
021	ECC	005	011	When prosperity increaseth, those that consume it [likewise] increase: and what advantage is there to its owner, saving to see [it] with his eyes?
021	ECC	005	012	Sweet is the sleep of the laboring man, whether he eat little or much; but the overabundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.
021	ECC	005	013	There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, [namely,] riches reserved for their owner to his own hurt.
021	ECC	005	014	And these riches are lost through an unfortunate event; and he begetteth a son, and hath not the least in his hand:
021	ECC	005	015	As he came forth out of his mother's womb, naked will he return to go as he came; and not the least will he carry off for his toil, which he might take away with him.
021	ECC	005	016	And also this is a sore evil, that in all points as he came, so must he go: and what profit hath he that hath toiled for the wind?
021	ECC	005	017	All his days also had he to eat in darkness, and hath had much vexation and wrath with his sickness.
021	ECC	005	018	Behold, what I have truly seen as a good thing, that it is fitting to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all one's toil that he taketh under the sun the number of the days of his life, which God hath given him; for this is his portion.
021	ECC	005	019	Also every man to whom God hath given riches and property, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his toil— this is the gift of God.
021	ECC	005	020	Let him then remember, that the days of his life are not many, that God hath answered him with the joy of his heart.
021	ECC	006	001	There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is great on men:
021	ECC	006	002	[There is many] a man to whom God hath given riches, property, and honor, and nothing is wanting for his soul of all that he longeth for: yet God empowereth him not to eat thereof, but a stranger will consume it. This is vanity, and it is an evil disease.
021	ECC	006	003	If a man were to beget a hundred children, and live many years, so that the days of his years were many, and his soul were not satisfied with what is good, and he have not had even a burial: then do I say, that an untimely birth is better than he.
021	ECC	006	004	For in vanity it came, and in darkness it departeth, and with darkness will its name be covered.
021	ECC	006	005	Moreover it never saw the sun, and knew nothing: this hath more rest than the other.
021	ECC	006	006	Yea, though he were to live a thousand years twice told, and had not seen any good— doth not every one go to one place?
021	ECC	006	007	All the toil of a man is for his mouth; and yet is his desire never filled.
021	ECC	006	008	For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor, that knoweth to walk [properly] before the living?
021	ECC	006	009	Better is what one seeth with the eyes than the wandering of the desire. Also this is vanity and a torture of the spirit.
021	ECC	006	010	That which hath been is already called by its name, and it is known that he is a man: and he is not able to contend with him that is mightier than he.
021	ECC	006	011	For there are many things that increase vanity: what advantage [cometh thence] for man?
021	ECC	006	012	For who knoweth what is good for man in this life, the number of the days of his vain life, that he should spend them as a shadow? for who can tell a man what will be after him under the sun?
021	ECC	007	001	A good name is better than precious oil, and the day of death, better than the day of one's birth.
021	ECC	007	002	It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting; inasmuch as that is the end of all men: and let the living lay it to his heart.
021	ECC	007	003	Better is vexation than laughing; for through the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.
021	ECC	007	004	The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of joy.
021	ECC	007	005	It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than that a man should hear the song of fools.
021	ECC	007	006	For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool. Also this is vanity.
021	ECC	007	007	For [exercising] oppression maketh a wise man mad; and bribery corrupteth the heart.
021	ECC	007	008	Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: better is the patient in spirit than the proud in spirit.
021	ECC	007	009	Be not rash in thy spirit to be angry; for anger resteth in bosom of fools.
021	ECC	007	010	Thou must not say, How was it that the former days were better than these? for it is not out of wisdom that thou askest concerning this.
021	ECC	007	011	Wisdom is better than an inheritance, yea, preferable for those that see the sun;
021	ECC	007	012	For under the shadow of wisdom [a man is equally well as] under the shadow of money; but the superior excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to him that possesseth it.
021	ECC	007	013	Consider [then] the work of God; for who can make straight what he hath made crooked?
021	ECC	007	014	On the day of prosperity be happy, but on the day of adversity look on: also this hath God made in equal measure with the other, to the end that man should not find the least to censure him.
021	ECC	007	015	All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is many a righteous man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is many a wicked man that liveth long in his wickedness.—
021	ECC	007	016	Be not righteous over much; neither show thyself over wise: why wouldst thou destroy thyself?
021	ECC	007	017	Be not wicked over much, and be no fool: why wouldst thou die before thy time?
021	ECC	007	018	It is good that thou shouldst take hold of that, and that also from this thou withdraw not thy hand; for he that feareth God will come forth out of them all.
021	ECC	007	019	Wisdom giveth more strength to the wise than ten rulers which were in the city.
021	ECC	007	020	For no man is so righteous upon earth, that he should do always good, and never sin.—
021	ECC	007	021	Also take no heed unto all the words that are spoken: lest thou hear thy servant cursing thee.
021	ECC	007	022	For oftentimes also doth thy own heart know that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.—
021	ECC	007	023	All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.
021	ECC	007	024	Far is what formerly was so, and what was deep remaineth deep: who can find it out?
021	ECC	007	025	Then I turned myself about together with my heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and experience, and to know the wickedness of folly, and the foolishness of madness.
021	ECC	007	026	And I find as more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and whose hands are bonds: he that is deemed good before God will escape from her; but the sinner will be caught by her.
021	ECC	007	027	Behold, this have I found, saith Koheleth, [adding] one to the other, to find experience,
021	ECC	007	028	What my soul constantly sought, but I found it not; one man among a thousand did I find; but a woman among all these did I not find.
021	ECC	007	029	Lo, this only did I find, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought for many [sinful] devices.
021	ECC	008	001	Who is like the wise? and who knoweth [as well] the explanation of a thing? a man's wisdom enlighteneth his face, and the boldness of his face will be lessened.
021	ECC	008	002	I [counsel thee], Keep the king's command, and that which regardeth the oath [to him taken] by God.
021	ECC	008	003	Be not hasty to go out of his presence; engage not in an evil thing; for whatsoever pleaseth him, can he do;
021	ECC	008	004	Because the word of a king is powerful; and who may say unto him, What doest thou?—
021	ECC	008	005	Whoso keepeth the commandment will experience no evil thing: and a wise man's heart knoweth both time and the just consequence.
021	ECC	008	006	Because for every pursuit there is a time and a just consequence; for the evil of man [resteth] heavily upon him.
021	ECC	008	007	For he knoweth not that which will be; for who can tell him how it will be?
021	ECC	008	008	No man hath control over the spirit to detain the spirit; and there is no control over the day of death; and there is no representation in that war; and wickedness will not deliver those that practise it.
021	ECC	008	009	All this have I seen, and directed my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: there is a time when one man ruleth over another to his own injury.
021	ECC	008	010	Then also did I see the wicked buried, who had gone to their rest; but those who had acted correctly had to go away from the holy place, and were forgotten in the city. Also this is vanity.
021	ECC	008	011	Because the punishment against evil deeds is not executed speedily, therefore is the heart of the sons of men filled up in them to do evil.
021	ECC	008	012	But let a sinner do evil a hundred times, and [God] withhold long his punishment from him; still do I truly know for certain that it will be well with those that fear God, because they are afraid of him;
021	ECC	008	013	And that it will not be well with the wicked, and that he will not endure many days, like the shadow; because he is not afraid of God.
021	ECC	008	014	There is a vanity which is done upon the earth, that there are righteous men, unto whom it happeneth in accordance with the deeds of the wicked; again, there are wicked men, to whom it happeneth in accordance with the deeds of the righteous. I said that this also is vanity.
021	ECC	008	015	Therefore do I praise joyfulness, that there is nothing better for man under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be joyful; for this will adhere to him in his toil, during the days of his life which God hath given him under the sun.—
021	ECC	008	016	When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the employment that is done upon the earth, how even neither by day nor by night sleep is seen in the eyes of some men:
021	ECC	008	017	Then did I see [in] the whole work of God, that a man is not able to find out the work that is done under the sun; inasmuch as though a man were to toil to seek for it, he would yet not find it; and even if the wise were to think to know it, he would yet not be able to find it.
021	ECC	009	001	For all this did I reflect over in my heart and to explain all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their services, are in the hand of God: that man knoweth neither love nor hatred; it is all [ordained] before them;
021	ECC	009	002	Every thing as it is to happen to all; there is but one occurrence for the righteous, and for the wicked; for the good and for the clean, and for the unclean; and for him that sacrificeth, and for him that sacrificeth not; as is the good, so is the sinner; he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath.
021	ECC	009	003	This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that there is one occurrence for all, and that also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and that madness is in their heart while they live, and after this they go to the dead.
021	ECC	009	004	For whoever is yet united with all the living hath still hope; for a living dog fareth better than a dead lion.
021	ECC	009	005	For the living know that they will die; but the dead know not the least; nor have they longer any reward; for their memory is forgotten.
021	ECC	009	006	Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, are now already lost; and they will have never more a portion in all that is done under the sun.
021	ECC	009	007	Go, eat with joy thy bread, and drink with a merry heart thy wine, if God have already received thy works in favor.
021	ECC	009	008	At all times let thy garments be white, and let oil not be wanting on thy head.
021	ECC	009	009	Enjoy life with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which God hath given thee under the sun, [yea,] all the days of thy vanity; for this is thy portion in this life, and in thy toil with which thou toilest under the sun.
021	ECC	009	010	Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do with thy might, that do; for there is no work, nor experience, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the nether world, whither thou goest.—
021	ECC	009	011	I turned about, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the mighty; and that also the wise have no bread, nor yet the men of understanding riches, nor yet men of knowledge favor; but time and fate will overtake them all.
021	ECC	009	012	For man also knoweth not his time, like the fishes that are caught in an evil net, and like the birds that are caught in the snare: like these are the sons of men ensnared at an evil time, when it falleth upon them suddenly.
021	ECC	009	013	Also in this manner have I seen wisdom under the sun, and it seemed great unto me:
021	ECC	009	014	There was a little city, and the men therein were few; and there came against it a great king, who enclosed it, and built around it great works of siege;
021	ECC	009	015	But there was found in it a poor wise man, and he delivered the city by his wisdom; yet no man had thought of that same poor man.
021	ECC	009	016	Then said I, Wisdom is better than might: although the poor man's wisdom is held in contempt, and his words are not heard.
021	ECC	009	017	The words of wise men heard in quiet are better than the cry of him that ruleth among fools.
021	ECC	009	018	Wisdom is better than weapons of war; but one sinner causes much good to be lost.
021	ECC	010	001	Dead flies cause the precious oil of the apothecary to become stinking and foaming; so doth a little folly him that is valued for wisdom and honor.
021	ECC	010	002	The heart of a wise man is at his right hand; but the heart of a fool is at his left.
021	ECC	010	003	Yea also, on whatever way the fool walketh, doth he lack proper sense, and he saith to all that he is a fool.
021	ECC	010	004	If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for submissiveness causeth great offences to be avoided.
021	ECC	010	005	There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, like an error which proceedeth from the ruler:
021	ECC	010	006	Folly is set in great high places, and the rich sit in lowness.
021	ECC	010	007	I have seen servants on horses, and princes walking like servants upon the ground.—
021	ECC	010	008	He that diggeth a pit will fall into it; and him who breaketh down a fence—a serpent will bite him.
021	ECC	010	009	Whoso removeth stones will be hurt through them; and he that cleaveth wood will be endangered thereby.
021	ECC	010	010	If the iron be blunt, and man do not whet the edge, then must he exert more strength; but the advantage of making it properly sharp is wisdom.
021	ECC	010	011	If the serpent do bite because no one uttered a charm, then hath the man that can use his tongue [in charming] no preference.—
021	ECC	010	012	The words of a wise man's mouth [bring] grace; but the lips of a fool will destroy himself.
021	ECC	010	013	The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness; and the last that cometh out of his mouth is evil-bringing madness.
021	ECC	010	014	The fool also multiplieth words; [but] a man cannot know what is to be; and what is to be after him, who can tell him?
021	ECC	010	015	The toil of the foolish will weary every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city.—
021	ECC	010	016	Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is lowminded, and when thy princes eat in the morning!
021	ECC	010	017	Happy art thou, O land, when thy king is noble-spirited, and thy princes eat in proper time, for strengthening, and not for gluttony!—
021	ECC	010	018	Through slothful hands the rafters will sink; and through idleness of the hands the house will become leaky.
021	ECC	010	019	For gay pleasure they prepare a feast, and wine is to make the living joyful; but money procureth all things.
021	ECC	010	020	Even in thy thought thou must not curse a king; and in thy bed-chambers do not curse the rich; for a bird of the air can carry the sound, and that which hath wings can tell the word.
021	ECC	011	001	Cast thy bread upon the face of the waters; for after many days wilt thou find it again.
021	ECC	011	002	Give a portion to seven, and also to eight: for thou knowest not what evil may come upon the earth.—
021	ECC	011	003	If the clouds be full of rain, they will empty it out upon the earth; and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, on the place where the tree falleth, there will it remain.
021	ECC	011	004	He that watcheth the wind will not sow; and he that gazeth on the clouds will not reap.
021	ECC	011	005	As thou knowest not which is the way of the wind, as little as what is enclosed in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou canst not know the works of God who maketh all.
021	ECC	011	006	In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening let not thy hand rest; for thou knowest not which will succeed, whether this or that, or whether both of them will be alike good.
021	ECC	011	007	Truly the light is sweet, and it is a pleasant thing for the eyes to see the sun;
021	ECC	011	008	For if a man live [even] many years, let him rejoice in them all; and let him remember the days of darkness; for they will be many; all that cometh is vanity.
021	ECC	011	009	Rejoice, O young man, in thy childhood; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youthful vigor, and walk firmly in the ways of thy heart, and in [the direction which] thy eyes see: but know thou, that concerning all these things God will bring thee into judgment.
021	ECC	011	010	And remove vexation from thy heart, and cause evil to pass away from thy body; for childhood and the time when the head is black are vanity.
021	ECC	012	001	But remember also thy Creator in the days of thy youthful vigor, while the evil days are not yet come, nor those years draw nigh of which thou wilt say, I have no pleasure in them;
021	ECC	012	002	While the sun, and the light, and the moon, and the stars, are not yet darkened, and the clouds return not again after the rain;
021	ECC	012	003	On the day when the watchmen of the house will tremble and the men of might will bend themselves, and the grinders stand idle, because they are become few, and those be darkened that look through the windows;
021	ECC	012	004	And when the two doors on the streets will be locked, while the sound of the mill becometh dull, and man riseth up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of song are brought low;
021	ECC	012	005	Also when men will be afraid of every elevation, and are terrified on every way, and the almond-tree will refuse [its blossom], and the locust will drag itself slowly along, and the desire will gainsay compliance; because man goeth to his eternal home, and the mourners go about the streets;
021	ECC	012	006	While the silver cord is not yet torn loose, and the golden bowl is not crushed, and the pitcher is not broken at the fountain, and the wheel is not crushed at the cistern;
021	ECC	012	007	When the dust will return to the earth as it was, and the spirit will return unto God who gave it.—
021	ECC	012	008	Vanity of vanities, saith Koheleth: all is vanity.—
021	ECC	012	009	And in addition to this that Koheleth was wise, he continually also taught the people knowledge, and he probed, and searched out, and composed many proverbs.
021	ECC	012	010	Koheleth sought to find out acceptable words, and that which would be written down uprightly, even words of truth.
021	ECC	012	011	The words of the wise are like goads, and like nails fastened [are the words of] the men of the assemblies, which are given by one shepherd.
021	ECC	012	012	But more than all these, my son, take warning for thyself: the making of many books would have no end; and much preaching is a weariness of the flesh.
021	ECC	012	013	The end of the matter is, let us hear the whole: Fear God, and keep his commandments; for this is the whole [duty of] man.
021	ECC	012	014	For every deed will God bring into the judgment concerning every thing that hath been hidden, whether it be good, or whether it be bad.

# BOOK	022	SOL	Song of Solomon	Song of Solomon
022	SOL	001	001	The song of songs, which is Solomon's.
022	SOL	001	002	Oh that he might kiss me with the kisses of his mouth; for thy caresses are more pleasant than wine.
022	SOL	001	003	To the smell are thy fragrant oils pleasant, [like] precious oil poured forth is thy name [famous afar]: therefore do maidens love thee.
022	SOL	001	004	Oh draw me, after thee will we run: the king hath brought me into his chambers; we will be glad and rejoice in thee; we will recall thy caresses, more [pleasant] than wine; without deceit [all] love thee.—
022	SOL	001	005	Black am I, yet comely, O daughters of Jerusalem, like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon.
022	SOL	001	006	Look not so at me, because I am somewhat black, because the sun hath looked fiercely at me: my mother's children were angry with me; they appointed me to be keeper of the vineyards; but my vineyard, which is my own, have I not kept.—
022	SOL	001	007	Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest? where lettest thou thy flock rest at noon? for why should I appear like a veiled mourner by the flocks of thy companions?—
022	SOL	001	008	If thou knowest this not, O thou fairest of women, go but forth in the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids around the shepherds' dwellings.—
022	SOL	001	009	Unto the horse in Pharaoh's chariot do I compare thee, my beloved.
022	SOL	001	010	Comely are thy cheeks between strings [of pearls], thy neck with rows [of jewels].
022	SOL	001	011	Chains of gold will we make for thee with studs of silver.—
022	SOL	001	012	While the king sitteth at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth its [pleasant] smell.
022	SOL	001	013	A bundle of myrrh is my friend unto me, that resteth on my bosom.
022	SOL	001	014	A copher-cluster is my friend unto me in the vineyards of 'En-gedi.—
022	SOL	001	015	Lo, thou art beautiful, my beloved: lo, thou art beautiful: thy eyes are those of a dove.—
022	SOL	001	016	Lo, thou art beautiful, my friend, also pleasant: also our couch is [made in the] green [wood].
022	SOL	001	017	The beams of our houses are cedars and our wainscoting of cypress-trees.
022	SOL	002	001	I am the rose of Sharon, the lily of the valleys.—
022	SOL	002	002	Like the lily among the thorns, so is my beloved among the young maidens.—
022	SOL	002	003	Like the apple-tree among the trees of the forest, so is my friend among the young men: under his shadow do I ardently wish to sit, and his fruit is sweet to my palate.
022	SOL	002	004	He brought me to the banqueting-house, and his banner over me was love.
022	SOL	002	005	Strengthen me with flagons of wine, refresh me with apples; for sick of love am I.
022	SOL	002	006	Oh that his left hand might be under my head, and that his right might embrace me.
022	SOL	002	007	I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye awaken not, nor excite my love, till it please [to come of itself].—
022	SOL	002	008	The voice of my friend! behold, there he cometh, leaping over the mountains, skipping over the hills.
022	SOL	002	009	My friend is like a roebuck or the fawn of the hinds: behold, there he standeth behind our wall, looking in at the windows, seeing through the lattice.
022	SOL	002	010	My friend commenced, and said unto me, Rise thee up, my beloved, my fair one, and come along.
022	SOL	002	011	For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone its way.
022	SOL	002	012	The flowers are seen in the land; the time of the [birds'] singing is come, and the voice of the turtle-dove is heard in our land;
022	SOL	002	013	The fig-tree perfumeth its green figs, and the vines with young grapes give forth a [pleasant] smell. Arise thee, my beloved, my fair one, and come along.
022	SOL	002	014	O my dove, who art in the clefts of the rock, in the recesses of the cliffs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for thy voice is sweet, and thy countenance is comely.—
022	SOL	002	015	Seize for us the foxes, the little foxes, that injure the vineyards; for our vineyards have young grapes.
022	SOL	002	016	My friend is mine, and I am his—that feedeth among the lilies.
022	SOL	002	017	Until the day become cool, and the shadows flee away, turn about, my friend, and be thou like the roebuck or the fawn of the hinds upon the mountains of separation.
022	SOL	003	001	On my couch during the nights I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.
022	SOL	003	002	Oh, I must rise now, and go about in the city in the streets, and in the open places; I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.
022	SOL	003	003	Then found me the watchmen that walked about the city. “Have ye seen him whom my soul loveth?”
022	SOL	003	004	Scarcely had I passed away from them, when I found him whom my soul loveth: I laid fast hold of him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her that had born me.
022	SOL	003	005	I adjure you, ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye awaken not, nor excite my love, till it please [to come of itself].—
022	SOL	003	006	Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all spicy powders of the merchant?
022	SOL	003	007	Behold, it is the bed, which is Solomon's, sixty valiant men are round about it, of the valiant ones of Israel.
022	SOL	003	008	All of them are girded with the sword, are expert in war; every one hath his sword upon his thigh, because of the terror in the nights.
022	SOL	003	009	A palanquin did king Solomon make for himself out of the wood of Lebanon.
022	SOL	003	010	The pillars thereof he made of silver, its coverlid of gold, its seat of purple: its inner part is arranged lovely, by the daughters of Jerusalem.
022	SOL	003	011	Go forth, and look, O ye daughters of Zion, on king Solomon, with the crown wherewith his mother hath crowned him on the day of his espousals, and on the day of the joy in his heart.
022	SOL	004	001	Behold, thou art beautiful, my beloved, behold, thou art beautiful: thy dovelike eyes [look forth] from behind thy vail; thy hair is like a flock of goats, that come quietly down from Mount Gil'ad.
022	SOL	004	002	Thy teeth are like a flock of well-selected sheep, which are come up from the washing, all of which bear twins, and there is not one among them that is deprived of her young.
022	SOL	004	003	Like a thread of scarlet are thy lips, and thy mouth is comely: like the half of a pomegranate is the upper part of thy cheek behind thy vail.
022	SOL	004	004	Thy neck is like the tower of David built on terraces, a thousand shields hang-thereon, all the quivers of the mighty men.
022	SOL	004	005	Thy two breasts are like two fawns, the twins of the roe, that feed among the lilies.
022	SOL	004	006	Until the day became cool, and the shadows flee away, will I get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.
022	SOL	004	007	Thou art altogether beautiful, my beloved, and there is no blemish on thee.—
022	SOL	004	008	Come with me from Lebanon, O bride, with me from Lebanon: look about from the top of Amanah, from the top of Senir and Chermon, from the lions' dens, from the leopards' mountains.
022	SOL	004	009	Thou hast ravished my heart, O my sister, [my] bride; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thy eyes, with one chain of thy neck.
022	SOL	004	010	How beautiful are thy caresses, O my sister, [my] bride! how much more pleasant are thy caresses than wine! and the smell of thy fragrant oils more than all spices.
022	SOL	004	011	Of sweet honey drop thy lips, O bride: honey and milk are under thy tongue; and the scent of thy garments is like the scent of Lebanon.
022	SOL	004	012	A locked-up garden is my sister, [my] bride; a locked-up spring, a sealed fountain.
022	SOL	004	013	Thy sprouts are an orchard of pomegranates, with precious fruits, copher and spikenard;
022	SOL	004	014	Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all the trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief of spices;
022	SOL	004	015	A garden-spring, a well of living waters, and flowing down from Lebanon.—
022	SOL	004	016	Awake, O north wind; and come thou, O south; blow over my garden, that its spices may flow out. Let my friend come into his garden, and eat its precious fruits.—
022	SOL	005	001	I am come into my garden, my sister, [my] bride; I have plucked my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my sugar-cane with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, ye companions; drink, yea, drink abundantly, ye friends.—
022	SOL	005	002	I slept, but my heart was awake: [there was] the voice of my beloved that knocked, “Open for me, my sister, my beloved, my dove, my guiltless one; for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.”
022	SOL	005	003	I have put off my coat: how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet: how shall I defile them?
022	SOL	005	004	My friend stretched forth his hand through the opening, and my inmost parts were moved for him.
022	SOL	005	005	I rose up myself to open for my friend; and my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with fluid myrrh, upon the handles of the lock.
022	SOL	005	006	I indeed opened for my beloved; but my beloved had vanished, and was gone: my soul had failed me while he was speaking; I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he answered me not.
022	SOL	005	007	Then found me the watchmen that walked about the city; they smote me, they wounded me: they took away my vail from me, they that watched the walls.
022	SOL	005	008	I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, what will ye tell him? that I am sick of love.—
022	SOL	005	009	What is thy friend more than another's friend, O thou fairest of women? what is thy friend more than another's friend, that thus thou adjurest us?—
022	SOL	005	010	My friend is white and ruddy, distinguished among ten thousand.
022	SOL	005	011	His head is bright as the finest gold, his locks are like waving foliage, and black as a raven.
022	SOL	005	012	His eyes are like [those of] doves by streamlets of waters, bathed in milk, well fitted in their setting.
022	SOL	005	013	His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as turrets of sweet perfumes: his lips, like lilies, dropping with fluid myrrh.
022	SOL	005	014	His hands are like wheels of gold beset with the chrysolite: his body, an image made of ivory overlaid with sapphires.
022	SOL	005	015	His legs are like pillars of marble, resting upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent like the cedars.
022	SOL	005	016	His palate is full of sweets, and every thing in him is agreeable. This is my friend, and this is my beloved, O daughters of Jerusalem.—
022	SOL	006	001	Whither is thy friend gone, O fairest of women? whither hath thy friend turned himself? that we may seek him with thee?—
022	SOL	006	002	My beloved is gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.
022	SOL	006	003	I am my friend's, and my friend is mine: he that feedeth among the lilies.—
022	SOL	006	004	Thou art beautiful, O my beloved, like Thirzah, comely like Jerusalem, terrible as armies encamped round their banners.
022	SOL	006	005	Turn away thy eyes from me, for they have excited me: thy hair is like a flock of goats that come quietly down from mount Gil'ad.
022	SOL	006	006	Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes which are come up from the washing, all of which bear twins, and there is not one among them that is deprived of her young.
022	SOL	006	007	Like the half of the pomegranate is the upper part of thy cheek behind thy vail.
022	SOL	006	008	Sixty are the queens, and eighty the concubines, and the young women without number;
022	SOL	006	009	But one alone is my dove, my guiltless one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the chosen of her that bore her: maidens see her, and call her happy; yea, queens and concubines, and praise her.
022	SOL	006	010	Who is this that shineth forth like the morning-dawn, beautiful as the moon, bright as the sun, terrible as armies encamped round their banners?
022	SOL	006	011	Into the nut-garden was I gone down, to look about among the plants of the valley, to see whether the vine had blossomed, whether the pomegranates had budded.
022	SOL	006	012	I knew not [how it was], my soul made me [like] the chariots of my noble people.
022	SOL	006	013	Return, return, O Shulammith; return, return, that we may look upon thee. “What will ye see in the Shulammith?” As though it were the dance of a double company.
022	SOL	007	001	How beautiful are thy steps in sandals, O prince's daughter! the roundings of thy thighs are like jewelled ornaments, the work of the hands of the artificer.
022	SOL	007	002	Thy navel is like a round goblet which lacketh not the mixed wine: thy body is like a heap of wheat fenced about with lilies.
022	SOL	007	003	Thy two breasts are like two fawns, the twins of the roe.
022	SOL	007	004	Thy neck is like a tower of ivory; thy eyes are like the pools in Cheshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim; thy nose is like the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus.
022	SOL	007	005	Thy head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thy head like purple: a king is held bound in the tresses.
022	SOL	007	006	How beautiful and how pleasant art thou, O love, in thy attractions!
022	SOL	007	007	This thy stature is like a palm-tree, and thy breasts are like clusters of grapes.
022	SOL	007	008	I thought, I wish to climb up the palm-tree, I wish to take hold of its boughs; and, oh, that thy breasts might be like clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy nose like apples;
022	SOL	007	009	And thy palate like the best wine, that glideth down for my friend gently, exciting the lips of those that are asleep.—
022	SOL	007	010	I am my friend's, and toward me is his desire.
022	SOL	007	011	Come, my friend, let us go forth into the field; let us spend the night in the villages;
022	SOL	007	012	Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine have blossomed, whether the young grape have opened [to the view], whether the pomegranates have budded: there will I give my caresses unto thee.
022	SOL	007	013	The mandrakes give forth [their] smell, and at our doors are all manner of precious fruits, new and also old: O my friend, these have I laid up for thee.
022	SOL	008	001	Oh that some one would make thee as my brother that hath sucked my mother's breasts! should I then find thee without, I would kiss thee; and yet, people would not despise me.
022	SOL	008	002	I would lead thee, I would bring thee into my mother's house, thou shouldst teach me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine, of the sweet juice of my pomegranate.
022	SOL	008	003	Oh that his left hand might be under my head, and that his right hand might embrace me.
022	SOL	008	004	I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, why will ye awaken, and why will ye excite my love, until it please [to come of itself]?—
022	SOL	008	005	Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her friend?—Under the apple-tree have I waked thee up; there thy mother brought thee forth; there brought thee forth she that bore thee.
022	SOL	008	006	Set me as a seal upon thy heart, as a seal upon thy arm; for strong as death is love; violent like the nether world is jealousy; its heat is the heat of fire, a flame of God.
022	SOL	008	007	Many waters are not able to quench love, nor can the rivers flood it away: if a man were to give all the wealth of his house for love, men would utterly despise him.—
022	SOL	008	008	We have a little sister, and she hath yet no breasts: what shall we do for our sister on the day when she shall be spoken for?
022	SOL	008	009	If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she be a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar.—
022	SOL	008	010	I am a wall, and my breasts are like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favor.
022	SOL	008	011	Solomon had a vineyard at Ba'al-hamon; he had given up the vineyard unto the keepers; every one was to bring for its fruit a thousand pieces of silver.
022	SOL	008	012	My vineyard, which was mine, was before me: thine, O Solomon, be the thousand, and let two hundred be for those that keep its fruit.—
022	SOL	008	013	“Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions listen for thy voice: oh let me hear it.”
022	SOL	008	014	Flee away, my friend, and be thou like the roebuck, or the fawn of the hinds, upon the mountain of spices.

# BOOK	023	ISA	Isaiah	Isaiah
023	ISA	001	001	The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of 'Uzziyahu, Jotham, Achaz, and Hezekiah, the kings of Judah.
023	ISA	001	002	Hear, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth; for the Lord hath spoken: Children have I nourished and brought up, but they have rebelled against me.
023	ISA	001	003	The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.
023	ISA	001	004	Woe! sinful nation, people laden with iniquity, seed of evil-doers, children that are corrupt: they have forsaken the Lord, they have incensed the Holy One of Israel, they are departed backward.
023	ISA	001	005	Why will ye be stricken yet more? [that] ye increase the revolt? every head is sick, and every heart is faint.
023	ISA	001	006	From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrefying sores: they have not been closed, nor bound up, nor mollified with oil.
023	ISA	001	007	Your country is desolate, your cities are burnt with fire; your soil—in your presence, strangers devour it, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.
023	ISA	001	008	And left is the daughter of Zion as a hut in a vineyard, as a lodge in a cucumber field, as a besieged city.
023	ISA	001	009	Unless the Lord of hosts had left unto us a remnant ever so small, like Sodom should we have been, unto Gomorrah should we have been compared.
023	ISA	001	010	Hear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodom: give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.
023	ISA	001	011	For what serveth me the multitude of your sacrifices? saith the Lord: I am sated with the burnt-offerings of rams, and the fat of fatted beasts; and the blood of bullocks, and of sheep, and of he-goats, I do not desire.
023	ISA	001	012	When ye come to appear in my presence—who hath required this at your hand, to tread down my courts?
023	ISA	001	013	Continue no more to bring an oblation of deceit; incense of abomination is it unto me: new moon and sabbath, the calling of assemblies—I cannot bear misdeed with festive gathering.
023	ISA	001	014	Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth; they are become a burden unto me; I am weary to bear them,
023	ISA	001	015	And when ye spread forth your hands, I will withdraw my eyes from you; yea, when ye make ever so many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.
023	ISA	001	016	Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean; put away the evil of your deeds from before my eyes; cease to do evil;
023	ISA	001	017	Learn to do well; seek for justice, relieve the oppressed, do justice to the fatherless, plead for the widow.
023	ISA	001	018	Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins should be as scarlet, they shall become white as the snow; though they should be red like crimson, they shall become like wool.
023	ISA	001	019	If ye be willing and obey, the best of the land shall ye eat;
023	ISA	001	020	But if ye refuse and rebel, by the sword shall ye be devoured; for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.
023	ISA	001	021	How is she become a harlot, the faithful town! she, that was full of justice; righteousness lodged therein; but now murderers.
023	ISA	001	022	Thy silver is become dross, thy wine is drugged with water;
023	ISA	001	023	Thy princes are rebels, and companions of thieves; every one loveth brides, and runneth after rewards; to the fatherless they will not do justice, and the cause of the widow doth not come unto them.
023	ISA	001	024	Therefore saith the Lord, the Eternal of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will take satisfaction on my adversaries, and be avenged on my enemies.
023	ISA	001	025	And I will turn my hand against thee, and purge away as with lye thy dross, and remove all thy tin:
023	ISA	001	026	And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning; after that shalt thou be called, The city of righteousness, the town that is faithful.
023	ISA	001	027	Zion shall be redeemed through justice, and her converts through righteousness.
023	ISA	001	028	But destruction shall come over transgressors and sinners together, and those that forsake the Lord shall perish.
023	ISA	001	029	For people shall be ashamed because of the terebinths which ye had desired, and ye shall be put to the blush because of the gardens that ye had chosen.
023	ISA	001	030	For ye shall be as a terebinth the leaves of which wither, and as a garden that hath no water.
023	ISA	001	031	And the mighty oppressor shall become as tow, and his workman as a spark; and they shall both burn together, with none to quench.
023	ISA	002	001	The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz foresaw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
023	ISA	002	002	And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be firmly established on the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and unto it shall flow all the nations.
023	ISA	002	003	And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; that he may teach us of his ways, and we may walk in his paths; for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem.
023	ISA	002	004	And he will judge among the nations, and decide for many people; and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning-knives: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, and they shall not learn any more war.
023	ISA	002	005	O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the Lord.
023	ISA	002	006	For thou hast abandoned thy people, the house of Jacob, because they are full of [witchcraft] more than the east, and are soothsayers like the Philistines, and with the children of strangers they unite themselves.
023	ISA	002	007	And full became their land of silver and gold, and there is no end to their treasures; and full became their land of horses, and there is no end to their chariots;
023	ISA	002	008	And full became their land of idols; to the work of their own hands they bow themselves, to what their own fingers have made.
023	ISA	002	009	And so is bent down the son of earth, and humbled the man; and thou wilt not forgive them.
023	ISA	002	010	Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, because of the dread of the Lord, and because of the glory of his majesty.
023	ISA	002	011	The looks of human pride shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bent down: and exalted shall be the Lord alone on that day.
023	ISA	002	012	For there is a day [of judgment] unto the Lord of hosts over every proud and lofty one; and over every exalted one, that he be brought low;
023	ISA	002	013	And over all the cedars of the Lebanon, the high and exalted, and over all the oaks of Bashan;
023	ISA	002	014	And over all the high mountains, and over all the exalted hills;
023	ISA	002	015	And over every high tower, and over every fortified wall;
023	ISA	002	016	And over all the ships of Tharshish; and over all desirable palaces.
023	ISA	002	017	And the pride of man shall be bent down, and the haughtiness of men shall be humbled: and exalted shall be the Lord alone on that day.
023	ISA	002	018	And the idols will he utterly abolish.
023	ISA	002	019	And men shall enter into the caverns of rocks, and into the rifts of the earth, because of the dread of the Lord, and because of the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to terrify the earth.
023	ISA	002	020	On that day shall a man cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which have been made for him to worship, to the moles and to the bats;
023	ISA	002	021	To enter into the clefts of the rocks, and into the hollows of the cliffs, because of the dread of the Lord, and because of the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to terrify the earth.
023	ISA	002	022	Withdraw yourselves [then] from man, whose breath is in his nostrils; because, for what is he to be esteemed?
023	ISA	003	001	For, behold, the Lord, the Eternal of hosts, doth remove from Jerusalem and from Judah stay and staff, every stay of bread, and every stay of water.
023	ISA	003	002	The hero, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,
023	ISA	003	003	The captain of fifty, and the honorable man, and the counsellor, and the skilful artificer, and the eloquent orator.
023	ISA	003	004	And I will set up boys as their princes, and children shall rule over them.
023	ISA	003	005	And so shall the people press man against man, and one against the other: the boy shall demean himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honorable.
023	ISA	003	006	When a man will seize hold on his brother in the house of his father, [saying,] Thou hast a garment, thou shalt be our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand:
023	ISA	003	007	He will swear on that day, saying, I will not be a chief; and in my house is neither bread nor clothing; you shall not appoint me a ruler of the people.
023	ISA	003	008	For Jerusalem is sunk to decay, and Judah is fallen; because their tongue and their doings are against the Lord, to incense the eyes of his glory.
023	ISA	003	009	The boldness of their face testifieth against them; and like Sodom they tell openly their sin, they conceal it not. Woe unto their soul! for they have prepared evil unto themselves.
023	ISA	003	010	Say ye to the righteous, that he hath done well; for the fruit of their doings shall they eat.
023	ISA	003	011	Woe unto the wicked who doeth evil; for the recompense of his hands shall be bestowed on him.
023	ISA	003	012	My people! their oppressors are children, and women rule over them. O my people! thy leaders cause thee to err, and the direction of thy paths they corrupt.
023	ISA	003	013	The Lord is stepped forth to plead, and standeth up to judge the people.
023	ISA	003	014	The Lord will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and their princes; but ye—ye have eaten up the vineyard; the plunder of the poor is in your houses.
023	ISA	003	015	What mean ye that ye crush my people, and grind down the faces of the poor? saith the Lord the Eternal of hosts.
023	ISA	003	016	And the Lord said, Forasmuch as the daughters of Zion are proud, and walk with stretched forth necks and casting about their eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet:
023	ISA	003	017	Therefore will the Lord smite with leprosy the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the Lord will lay open their nakedness.
023	ISA	003	018	On that day will the Lord take away the beauty of their tinkling shoe-buckles, and the hair-nets, and the crescent-shaped ornaments,
023	ISA	003	019	The drops, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,
023	ISA	003	020	The bonnets, and the foot-chains, and the head-bands, and the tablets, and the earrings,
023	ISA	003	021	The finger-rings, and nose-jewels,
023	ISA	003	022	The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the shawls, and the pockets.
023	ISA	003	023	The mirrors, and the chemisettes, and the turbans, and the long vails.
023	ISA	003	024	And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be corruption; and instead of a girdle a rope; and instead of curled hair baldness; and instead of a wide garment a girding of sackcloth, a mark of burning instead of beauty.
023	ISA	003	025	Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty ones in the war.
023	ISA	003	026	And then shall her gates lament and mourn; and stript of all shall she sit upon the ground.
023	ISA	004	001	And seven women shall take hold of one man on that day, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by thy name, take but away our reproach.
023	ISA	004	002	On that day shall the sprout of the Lord be for ornament and for honor, and the fruit of the land for excellence and for glory for the escaped of Israel.
023	ISA	004	003	And it shall come to pass, that whoever is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, every one that is written down unto life in Jerusalem:
023	ISA	004	004	When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have scoured away the blood-guiltiness of Jerusalem from her midst, by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of destruction.
023	ISA	004	005	And then will the Lord create upon every dwelling of mount Zion, and upon her places of assembly, a cloud and smoke by day, and the brightness of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory shall be a covering.
023	ISA	004	006	And a tabernacle shall it be for a shade in the daytime from the heat, and for a refuge, and for a covert from tempest and from rain.
023	ISA	005	001	I will sing now for my beloved, the song of my dear one touching his vineyard. A vineyard had my beloved on a rich hill-top;
023	ISA	005	002	And he fenced it in, and cleared it of stones, and planted it with the choicest vines, and built a tower in its midst, and also a winepress he hewed out therein: and he hoped that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth worthless fruit.
023	ISA	005	003	And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, between me and my vineyard.
023	ISA	005	004	What more was to be done to my vineyard, that I had not done in it? Why then did I hope that it should bring forth grapes, while it brought forth worthless fruit?
023	ISA	005	005	And now I will let you know also what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away its hedge, and it shall be eaten off; I will break down its wall, and it shall be trodden down;
023	ISA	005	006	And I will lay it quite waste; it shall not be pruned, nor hoed around; and it shall be overgrown with briers and thorns; and the clouds will I command that they send down no rain upon it.
023	ISA	005	007	For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah are the plant of his delight: and he hoped for justice, but behold injustice; for equity, but behold iniquity.
023	ISA	005	008	Woe unto those that cause house to join on house, bring field near to field, till there is no more room, so that ye may be left alone as the inhabitants in the midst of the land!
023	ISA	005	009	In my ears [spoke] the Lord of hosts, Truly many houses shall become desolate, yea, great and beautiful ones without an inhabitant.
023	ISA	005	010	Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield [but] one bath, and a chomer-seed shall yield [but] an ephah.
023	ISA	005	011	Woe unto those that rise up early in the morning, that they may run after strong drink; that continue until late in the twilight, till wine inflame them!
023	ISA	005	012	And there are harp and psaltery, tambourine and flute, and wine at their drinking-feasts; but the deeds of the Lord they regard not, and the works of his hands they behold not.
023	ISA	005	013	Therefore are my people led into exile, for want of knowledge: and their honorable men suffer of famine, and their multitude are panting with thirst.
023	ISA	005	014	Therefore hath the deep enlarged her desire, and opened her mouth without measure: and there descend [Jerusalem's] glory, and her multitude, and her noise, and whoever rejoiced therein.
023	ISA	005	015	And bent down shall be the son of earth, and humbled shall be the man, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled;
023	ISA	005	016	And the Lord of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and the holy God shall be sanctified by [displaying his] righteousness.
023	ISA	005	017	Then shall the sheep feed according to their wont, and the ruins of the fat ones shall sojourners eat.
023	ISA	005	018	Woe unto those that draw iniquity with the cords of falsehood, and as with a wagon-rope, sinfulness;
023	ISA	005	019	That say, Let him make speed, let him hasten his work, that we may see it: and let draw nigh and come the counsel of the Holy One of Israel, that we may know it!
023	ISA	005	020	Woe unto those that say of the evil it is good, and of the good it is evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!
023	ISA	005	021	Woe unto those that are wise in their own eyes, and intelligent in their own esteem!
023	ISA	005	022	Woe unto those that are heroes to drink wine, and men of might to mingle strong drink;
023	ISA	005	023	Who justify the wicked in lieu of a bribe, and who deprive the righteous of their right!
023	ISA	005	024	Therefore as the tongue of the fire devoureth the stubble, and dry hay sinketh before the flame: so shall their root be as rotten things, and their blossom shall fly up as the dust; because they have despised the law of the Lord of hosts, and the word of the Holy One of Israel they have rejected.
023	ISA	005	025	For this cause is kindled the anger of the Lord against his people, and he stretcheth forth his hand against them, and he smiteth them; and the mountains tremble, and their carcasses lie like sweepings in the midst of the streets: with all this his anger is not turned away, but still is his hand stretched out.
023	ISA	005	026	And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from afar, and will call for one of them from the end of the earth; and, behold, with speed, swiftly, it cometh;
023	ISA	005	027	There is none weary, nor stumbling among its men; it slumbereth not, it sleepeth not; not loosened is the girdle of its loins, not broken is the latchet of its shoes;
023	ISA	005	028	Whose arrows are sharpened, and all whose bows are bent; its horses hoofs are hard like the flint, and its wheels like the whirlwind;
023	ISA	005	029	It hath a roar like the lioness, it roareth like the young lions: yea, it growleth, and layeth hold of the prey, and carrieth it safely off, with none to deliver.
023	ISA	005	030	And it will rage against them on that day like with the raging of the sea: and if one look unto the earth, behold, there is darkness, oppression, and the light is darkened through the darkness of its clouds.
023	ISA	006	001	In the year of king 'Uzziyahu's death I saw the Lord sitting upon a high and exalted throne, and his train filled the temple.
023	ISA	006	002	Seraphim were standing around him, each one had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two did he fly.
023	ISA	006	003	And one called unto the other, and said, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory.
023	ISA	006	004	And the posts of the threshold shook at the voice of those that called aloud, and the house was filled with smoke.
023	ISA	006	005	And I said, Woe is me! for I am lost; because a man of unclean lips am I, and in the midst of a people of unclean lips do I dwell; for the King, the Lord of hosts have my eyes seen.
023	ISA	006	006	Then flew unto me one of the seraphim, and in his hand was a live coal, with the tongs had he taken it from off the altar:
023	ISA	006	007	And he touched therewith upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thy iniquity is departed, and thy sin is forgiven.
023	ISA	006	008	And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? And I said, Here am I: send me.
023	ISA	006	009	And he said, Go, and say unto this people, Hear indeed, but understand not; and see indeed, but know not.
023	ISA	006	010	Obdurate will remain the heart of this people, and their ears will be heavy, and their eyes will be shut: so that they will not see with their eyes, nor hear with their ears, nor their hearts be understanding, so that they be converted, and healing be granted them.
023	ISA	006	011	And I said, How long, O Lord? And he said, Until that cities be left waste without an inhabitant, and houses without man, and the soil be made desolate as a wilderness,
023	ISA	006	012	And the Lord will have removed far away the men, and the depopulation be great in the midst of the land.
023	ISA	006	013	And should a tenth part thereof yet remain, it will again be swept away: [yet] like the terebinth and the oak, which, when they cast their leaves, retain their stems, so remaineth the holy seed, its stem.
023	ISA	007	001	And it came to pass in the days of Achaz the son of Jotham, the son of 'Uzziyahu, the king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekach the son of Remalyahu, the king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it; but were not able to make an attack upon it.
023	ISA	007	002	And it was told unto the house of David, saying, Syria is encamped with Ephraim; and his heart trembled, with the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest are shaken before the wind.
023	ISA	007	003	And the Lord said unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Achaz, thou with Shear-yashub thy son, to the end of the aqueduct of the upper pool, on the highway of the washer's field;
023	ISA	007	004	And thou shalt say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, and let thy heart not become faint because of these two stumps of smoking firebrands, before the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remalyahu.
023	ISA	007	005	Forasmuch as Syria, [with] Ephraim and the son of Remalyahu, have taken evil counsel against thee, saying,
023	ISA	007	006	Let us go up against Judah, and besiege it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set up as king in the midst of it the son of Tabeal:
023	ISA	007	007	Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, It shall not succeed, and it shall not come to pass.
023	ISA	007	008	For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin: and within sixty and five years shall Ephraim be broken, to be no more a people.
023	ISA	007	009	And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remalyahu's son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not have permanence.
023	ISA	007	010	And the Lord continued to speak unto Achaz, saying,
023	ISA	007	011	Ask thee a sign from the Lord thy God; ask it in the depth, or high up above.
023	ISA	007	012	But Achaz said, I will not ask, and I will not tempt the Lord.
023	ISA	007	013	And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David! Is it too little for you to weary men, that ye will weary also my God?
023	ISA	007	014	Therefore will the Lord himself give you a sign: behold, this young woman shall conceive, and bear a son, and she shall call his name 'Immanu-el, [God with us].
023	ISA	007	015	Cream and honey shall he eat, so soon as he knoweth to refuse the evil, and to choose the good.
023	ISA	007	016	For before yet the child shall know to refuse the evil, and to choose the good, shall be forsaken the land, of the kings of which thou feelest dread.
023	ISA	007	017	The Lord will bring over thee, and over thy people, and over thy father's house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim withdrew from Judah, —the king of Assyria.
023	ISA	007	018	And it shall come to pass on that day, that the Lord will call for the fly that is in the uttermost end of the streams of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.
023	ISA	007	019	And they shall come, and shall encamp, all of them, in the desolate valleys, and in the clefts of the rocks, and upon all thorn-hedges, and upon all bushes.
023	ISA	007	020	On the same day will the Lord shave with the razor that is hired, from among those on the other side of the river, with the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and also the beard shall it entirely remove.
023	ISA	007	021	And it shall come to pass on that day, that a man shall nourish [but] one young cow, and two sheep;
023	ISA	007	022	And it shall happen, that for the abundance of milk which they shall give he shall eat cream; for cream and honey shall eat every one that is left in the midst of the land.
023	ISA	007	023	And it shall come to pass on that day, that every place, where there are [now] a thousand vines worth a thousand silver shekels, shall be, —yea, this shall be [given up] to briers and thorns.
023	ISA	007	024	With arrows and with bows shall men enter thither; because all the land shall become [covered with] briers and thorns.
023	ISA	007	025	And all mountains that are worked with the mattock, there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns: and they shall serve for the pasture of oxen, and for the treading of sheep.
023	ISA	008	001	And the Lord said unto me, Take thyself a large table, and write on it with distinct letters, Lemaher-shalal-chash-bas.
023	ISA	008	002	And I was to summon for myself trustworthy witnesses, Uriyah the priest, and Zecharyahu the son of Yeberechyahu.
023	ISA	008	003	And I came near unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bore a son. Then said the Lord to me, Call his name Maher-shalal-chash-bas.
023	ISA	008	004	For before yet the boy shall know to call, My father, and my mother, the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be carried away before the king of Assyria.
023	ISA	008	005	And the Lord continued to speak unto me again, saying,
023	ISA	008	006	Forasmuch as this people despiseth the waters of Shiloach that flow softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remalyahu's son:
023	ISA	008	007	Yea therefore behold, the Lord bringeth up over them the strong and many waters of the river, —the king of Assyria, and all his glory; and he shall come up over all his channels, and step over all his banks;
023	ISA	008	008	And he shall penetrate into Judah, overflow and flood over, even to the neck shall he reach; and his outstretched wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O 'Immanu-el.
023	ISA	008	009	Associate yourselves, O ye people, yet shall ye be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of the far portions of the earth: gird yourselves, yet shall ye be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, yet shall ye be broken in pieces.
023	ISA	008	010	Take counsel together, yet shall it come to naught; speak the word, and it shall not stand firm; for with us is God.
023	ISA	008	011	For thus said the Lord to me with the strength of prophecy, and warned me not to walk in the way of this people, saying,
023	ISA	008	012	Call ye not a conspiracy all that this people may call a conspiracy, and what it feareth shall ye not fear, and be not terrified [thereat].
023	ISA	008	013	The Lord of hosts, him shall ye sanctify; and let him be your fear, and let him be your terror.
023	ISA	008	014	And he will be for a sanctuary; but also for a stone of stumbling and for a rock to fall over unto both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
023	ISA	008	015	And many shall stumble over them, and fall, and be broken, and snared, and be caught.
023	ISA	008	016	Bind up the testimony, seal up the law among my disciples.
023	ISA	008	017	And I will wait for the Lord, that hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and I will hope for him.
023	ISA	008	018	Behold, I and the children whom the Lord hath given me are for signs and for tokens in Israel, from the Lord of hosts who dwelleth on mount Zion.
023	ISA	008	019	And when they shall say unto you, “Inquire of those that have familiar spirits, and of the wizards, that whisper, and that mutter:” should not a people inquire of their God? [should we then] in behalf of the living [inquire] of the dead?
023	ISA	008	020	[Hold] to the law and to the testimony: if they are not to speak according to this word, in which there is no light.
023	ISA	008	021	And the [people] shall pass through [the land], hard oppressed and hungry: and it shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they will become enraged, and curse their king and their god, and turn toward on high [for aid].
023	ISA	008	022	And they will look unto the earth; and behold there are trouble and darkness, dimness of oppression, and they shall be scattered into obscurity.
023	ISA	009	001	For no fatigue [befalleth] him that oppresseth it; in the first time he made light of the land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali, and at the last he will deal hard, with the way by the sea, on the other side of the Jordan, [up to] the Galilee of the nations.
023	ISA	009	002	The people that walk in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death—a light shineth brightly over them.
023	ISA	009	003	Thou hast multiplied the nation, made great their joy: they rejoice before thee as with the joy in harvest, as men are glad when they divide the spoil.
023	ISA	009	004	For the yoke of their burden, and the staff on their shoulder, the rod of their oppressor, hast thou broken, as on the day of Midian.
023	ISA	009	005	For all the weapons of the fighter in the battle's tumult, and the garment rolled in blood, shall be burnt, become food for fire.
023	ISA	009	006	For a child is born unto us, a son hath been given unto us, and the government is placed on his shoulders; and his name is called, Wonderful, counsellor of the mighty God, of the everlasting Father, the prince of peace,
023	ISA	009	007	For [promoting] the increase of the government, and for peace without end, upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom, to establish it and to support it through justice and righteousness, from henceforth and unto eternity: the zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this.
023	ISA	009	008	A word hath the Lord sent against Jacob, and it hath alighted upon Israel.
023	ISA	009	009	And experience it shall all the people together, Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria; because they say, in the pride and haughtiness of heart,
023	ISA	009	010	“The bricks are fallen down, but with hewn stones will we re-build: the sycamores are cut down, but with cedars will we replace them.”
023	ISA	009	011	Therefore will the Lord strengthen the adversaries of Rezin above him, and will stir up his enemies;
023	ISA	009	012	The Syrians in front, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with a full mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand still remaineth stretched out.
023	ISA	009	013	And the people return not unto him that smiteth them, and the Lord of hosts do they not seek.
023	ISA	009	014	And the Lord cutteth off from Israel head and tail, palm-branch and rush, on one day.
023	ISA	009	015	The ancient and honorable is the head; and the prophet that teacheth lies is the tail.
023	ISA	009	016	And the guides of this people are those that guide to error; and those that are led of them are misled.
023	ISA	009	017	Therefore will the Lord have no joy in their young men, and on their fatherless and widows will he have no mercy; for every one is a hypocrite and an evil-doer, and every mouth speaketh scandalous words. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand still remaineth stretched out.
023	ISA	009	018	For wickedness burneth like the fire; it shall devour the briers and thorns: and it shall kindle [a flame] in the thickets of the forest, and they shall be shrouded by the wreaths of smoke.
023	ISA	009	019	Through the fury of the Lord of hosts is the land scorched, and the people have become as food for the fire; no man will spare his brother.
023	ISA	009	020	And he snatcheth on the right hand, and is [yet] hungry; and he eateth on the left hand, and are not [yet] satisfied; they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm:
023	ISA	009	021	Menasseh [against] Ephraim: and Ephraim [against] Menasseh; and they together against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand still remaineth stretched out.
023	ISA	010	001	Woe unto those that decree decrees of unrighteousness, and the writers who write down wrongful things;
023	ISA	010	002	To turn aside from judgment the needy, and to rob the just due of the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and [that] they may plunder the fatherless!
023	ISA	010	003	And what will ye do on the day of the visitation, and at the desolation which will come from afar? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory?
023	ISA	010	004	Without me they shall kneel down under the prisoners, and under the slain shall they fall. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand still remaineth stretched out.
023	ISA	010	005	Woe over Asshur, the rod of my anger; and a staff is in their hand my indignation.
023	ISA	010	006	Against a hypocritical nation will I send him, and against the people of my fury will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to carry off the prey, and to render them trodden down like the mire of the streets.
023	ISA	010	007	But he deemeth it not so, and his heart doth not think so; but to destroy is in his heart, and to cut off nations not a few.
023	ISA	010	008	For he saith, “Are not my princes altogether kings?
023	ISA	010	009	Is not Calno like Karkemish? is not Chamath like Arpad? is not Samaria like Damascus?
023	ISA	010	010	As my hand hath reached the kingdoms of the idols, whose graven images exceeded in number those of Jerusalem and of Samaria:
023	ISA	010	011	Shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, do so unto Jerusalem and unto her idols?”
023	ISA	010	012	Wherefore shall it come to pass, that when the Lord hath completed all his work on mount Zion and in Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the haughtiness of the king of Asshur, and the vain-glory of his proud looks.
023	ISA	010	013	For he hath said, “By the strength of my hand have I done it, and by my wisdom, for I have intelligence; and I have removed the boundaries of nations, and their laid-up treasures have I plundered, and brought down low those that were powerfully seated.
023	ISA	010	014	And my hand hath reached, as a bird's nest, the wealth of the people: and as one gathereth up eggs that are forsaken, have I myself gathered up all the earth: and there was not one that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or chirped.”
023	ISA	010	015	Shall the axe boast itself over him that heweth therewith? or shall the saw magnify itself against him that swingeth it? as if the rod should swing about those that lift it up, or as if the staff should lift up him who is no wood.
023	ISA	010	016	Therefore will the Lord, the Eternal of hosts, send forth among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory shall be kindled a burning like the burning of a fire.
023	ISA	010	017	And the light of Israel shall become a fire, and his Holy One a flame; and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers on one day.
023	ISA	010	018	And the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body, will he destroy: and he shall be as [a tree] eaten to powder by the worms.
023	ISA	010	019	And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few in number, so that a boy may write them down.
023	ISA	010	020	And it shall come to pass on that day, that the remnant of Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall not farther lean for support upon him that smiteth them; but they shall lean upon the Lord, the Holy one of Israel, in truth.
023	ISA	010	021	The remnant shall return, the remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God.
023	ISA	010	022	For though thy people Israel should be as the sand of the sea, [yet] a remnant [only] of them shall return: destruction is decreed, it overfloweth with righteousness.
023	ISA	010	023	For it is completed and decreed: the Lord, the Eternal of hosts will do it in the midst of all the land.
023	ISA	010	024	Therefore thus hath said the Lord the Eternal of hosts, Be not afraid, O my people that dwellest in Zion, of Asshur, who will smite thee with the rod, and lift up his staff against thee, after the manner of Egypt.
023	ISA	010	025	For yet but a very little while more, and the indignation shall cease, and my anger shall be for their destruction.
023	ISA	010	026	And the Lord shall lift up a scourge over him like [at] the smiting of Midian at the rock of 'Oreb: and as his staff was lifted over the sea, so will he carry him off after the manner of Egypt.
023	ISA	010	027	And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be removed from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be broken because of the fatness.
023	ISA	010	028	He cometh to 'Ayath, he passeth on to Migron; at Michmash he layeth up his baggage;
023	ISA	010	029	They go through the pass; they take up their lodging at Geba'; Ramah trembleth; Gib'ah of Saul fleeth.
023	ISA	010	030	Let thy voice resound, O daughter of Gallim; listen Layshah; O poor 'Anathoth!
023	ISA	010	031	Madmenah is in motion; the inhabitants of Gebim are assembled to flee.
023	ISA	010	032	As yet today will he remain at Nob: then will he swing his hand against the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.
023	ISA	010	033	Behold, the Lord, the Eternal of hosts, will lop off the fruitful bough with terrific might: and those of towering growth shall be hewn down, and the high shall be laid low.
023	ISA	010	034	And he will cut down the thickets of the forests with iron, and the Lebanon shall fall by [means of] a mighty one.
023	ISA	011	001	And there shall come forth a shoot out of the stem of Jesse, and a sprout shall spring out of his roots.
023	ISA	011	002	And there shall rest upon him the spirit of the Lord, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord;
023	ISA	011	003	And he shall be animated by the fear of the Lord; and not after the sight of his eyes shall he judge, and not after the hearing of his ears shall he decide;
023	ISA	011	004	But he shall judge with righteousness the poor, and decide with equity for the suffering ones of the earth; and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.
023	ISA	011	005	And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his hips.
023	ISA	011	006	And the wolf shall dwell with the sheep, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling [shall be] together, and a little boy shall lead them.
023	ISA	011	007	And the cow and the she-bear shall feed, together shall their young ones lie down: and the lion shall like the ox eat straw.
023	ISA	011	008	And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and on the basilisk's den shall the weaned child stretch out his hand.
023	ISA	011	009	They shall not do hurt nor destroy on all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.
023	ISA	011	010	And it shall happen on that day, that [he of] the root of Jesse, who shall stand as an ensign of the people, to him shall nations [come to] inquire: and his resting-place shall be glorious.
023	ISA	011	011	And it shall happen on that day, that the Lord will put forth his hand again the second time to acquire the remnant of his people, which shall remain, from Asshur and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from 'Elam, and from Shin'ar, and from Chamath, and from the islands of the sea.
023	ISA	011	012	And he will lift up an ensign unto the nations, and will assemble the outcasts of Israel; and the dispersed of Judah will he collect together from the four corners of the earth.
023	ISA	011	013	And then shall depart the envy of Ephraim, and the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off: Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not assail Ephraim.
023	ISA	011	014	But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines toward the west; together shall they spoil the children of the east: upon Edom and Moab shall they lay their hands; and the children of 'Ammon shall obey them.
023	ISA	011	015	And the Lord will destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea; and swing his hand over the river with his mighty wind, and will smite it into seven streams, and render it passable with shoes.
023	ISA	011	016	And there shall be a highway for the remnant of his people, which shall remain from Asshur, like as it was to Israel on the day that they came up out of the land of Egypt.
023	ISA	012	001	And thou shalt say on that day, “I will thank thee, O Lord, that thou wast angry with me: thy anger [now] is turned away, and thou comfortest me.
023	ISA	012	002	Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust him; for my strength and song is Yah the Eternal: and he is become my salvation.”
023	ISA	012	003	And ye shall draw water with gladness out of the springs of salvation.
023	ISA	012	004	And ye shall say on that day, “Give thanks unto the Lord, call on his name, make known his deeds among the people, keep it in remembrance that exalted is his name.
023	ISA	012	005	Sing unto the Lord; for he hath wrought a stupendous thing: known is this on all the earth.”
023	ISA	012	006	Call aloud and shout, inhabitress of Zion; for great is in the midst of thee the Holy One of Israel.
023	ISA	013	001	The doom of Babylon, which Isaiah Amoz' son foresaw.
023	ISA	013	002	Upon a high mountain lift ye up a banner, raise high your voice unto them, wave the hand, that they may enter into the gates of the princes.
023	ISA	013	003	I have charged my prepared ones, I have also called my heroes for my anger, those that rejoice in my highness.
023	ISA	013	004	There is a noise of tumult on the mountains, like that of a numerous people; a noise of shouting of kingdoms of nations assembled; the Lord of hosts mustereth a host of battle.
023	ISA	013	005	They are coming from a far-off country, from the end of the heavens, [here is] the Lord, with the weapons of his indignation, to destroy all the land.
023	ISA	013	006	Wail ye; for nigh is the day of the Lord; like wasting from the Almighty shall it come.
023	ISA	013	007	Therefore all hands shall become weak, and every mortal's heart shall melt;
023	ISA	013	008	And they shall be affrighted, pangs and pains shall seize on them; they shall have throes as a woman that travaileth; one at the other shall they look amazed; red like flames shall their faces glow.
023	ISA	013	009	Behold, the day of the Lord cometh, direful, [laden] with wrath and the fierceness of anger, to render the earth desolate: and its sinners will he destroy out of it.
023	ISA	013	010	For the stars of the heavens and their constellations shall not give forth their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not shed abroad her light.
023	ISA	013	011	And I will visit on the world its evil, and on the wicked their iniquity; and I will stop the arrogance of the presumptuous, and the haughtiness of the tyrants will I humble.
023	ISA	013	012	I will make the mortal more precious than fine gold; and man, more than the valued metal of Ophir.
023	ISA	013	013	Therefore will I shake the heavens, and the earth shall start quaking out of her place, at the wrath of the Lord of hosts, and on the day of his fierce anger.
023	ISA	013	014	And the people shall be as the chased roe, and as flocks which no one gathereth up; every man to his own people shall they turn, and every man into his own land shall they flee.
023	ISA	013	015	Every one that is found shall be thrust through; and every one that is joined unto them shall fall by the sword.
023	ISA	013	016	And their babes shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes: spoiled shall be their houses, and their wives ravished.
023	ISA	013	017	Behold, I will stir up against them the Medes; who will not regard silver, and who will not delight in gold.
023	ISA	013	018	And their bows will dash young men to pieces; and on the fruit of the womb will they have no mercy; on children their eye will not look with pity.
023	ISA	013	019	And [thus] shall Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the proud ornament of the Chaldeans, become like the overthrow through God of Sodom and Gomorrah.
023	ISA	013	020	It shall not be inhabited for ever, and it shall not be dwelt in from generation to generation; nor shall the Arabian pitch there his tent; and shepherds shall not let their flocks rest there.
023	ISA	013	021	But there shall rest the wild beasts of the desert; and their houses shall be full of owls; and ostriches shall dwell there, and evil spirits shall dance there.
023	ISA	013	022	And jackals shall howl in her palaces, and monsters in the temples of pleasure; and near to come is her time, and her days shall not be extended.
023	ISA	014	001	For the Lord will have mercy on Jacob, and will again make choice of Israel, and replace them in their own land: and the strangers shall be joined unto them, and they shall attach themselves to the house of Jacob.
023	ISA	014	002	And nations shall take them, and bring them to their own place; but the house of Israel shall obtain possession of them in the land of the Lord for men-servants and for maid-servants; and they shall take captive their captors, and they shall rule over their oppressors.
023	ISA	014	003	And it shall come to pass on the day when the Lord will give thee rest from thy trouble, and from thy vexation, and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve,
023	ISA	014	004	That thou wilt take up this parable against the king of Babylon, and say, How hath ceased the oppressor! ceased the exactress of gold!
023	ISA	014	005	Broken hath the Lord the staff of the wicked, the sceptre of rulers;
023	ISA	014	006	He who smote people in wrath, blows without intermission, he that ruled in anger nations, persecuting without restraint.
023	ISA	014	007	At rest, quiet is all the earth; men break forth into loud song.
023	ISA	014	008	Also, the fir-trees rejoice at thee, the cedars of Lebanon, “Since thou wast laid low, no feller is come up against us.”
023	ISA	014	009	The nether world from below is in motion concerning thee to meet thee at thy coming: it stirreth up the departed for thee, all the chief ones of the earth; it hath caused to rise up from their thrones all the kings of nations.
023	ISA	014	010	They all will commence and say unto thee, “Thou—thou also art become weak like us; similar unto us art thou become!”
023	ISA	014	011	Into the nether world is brought down thy pride, the clatter of thy psalteries: beneath thee is spread the worm, and thy cover is the moth.
023	ISA	014	012	How art thou fallen from heaven, O morning-star, son of the dawn! how art thou hewn down to the ground, crusher of nations!
023	ISA	014	013	And thou—thou hadst said in thy heart, “Into heaven will I ascend, above the stars of God will I exalt my throne; and I will sit also upon the mount of the assembly, in the farthest end of the north;
023	ISA	014	014	I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be equal to the Most High.”
023	ISA	014	015	But into the nether world shalt thou be brought down, into the lowest depth.
023	ISA	014	016	They that see thee will gaze at thee, will regard thee well, [saying,] “Is this the man that caused the earth to tremble, that made kingdoms quake?
023	ISA	014	017	That rendered the world as a wilderness, and pulled down its cities: never opened the prison-house of his prisoners?”
023	ISA	014	018	All the kings of nations, all of them, lie in glory, every one in his own [eternal] house.
023	ISA	014	019	But thou—thou art cast out of thy grave like a discarded offshoot, as a garment of those that are slain, pierced by the sword, that go down to the stones of the pit, as a carcass trodden under foot.
023	ISA	014	020	Thou shalt not be united with them in burial; because thy land hast thou destroyed, thy people hast thou slain: to eternity shall not be called the seed of evil-doers.
023	ISA	014	021	Prepare for his children the slaughter, for the iniquity of their fathers: that they may not rise, and possess the land, and fill the face of the world with enemies [of mankind].
023	ISA	014	022	And I will rise up against them, saith the Lord of hosts; and I will cut off from Babylon name, and remnant, and son, and grandson, saith the Lord.
023	ISA	014	023	I will also make it a possession for the hedgehog, and pools of water: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the Lord of hosts.
023	ISA	014	024	Sworn hath the Lord of hosts, saying, Surely as I have purposed, so doth it come to pass; and as I have resolved, so shall it occur:
023	ISA	014	025	To break Asshur in my own land, and upon my mountains will I tread him under foot; then shall his yoke be removed from off them, and his burden from off their shoulders.
023	ISA	014	026	This is the resolve that is resolved over all the earth: and this is the hand that is stretched out over all the nations.
023	ISA	014	027	For the Lord of hosts hath resolved, and who shall frustrate it? and it is his hand which is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?
023	ISA	014	028	In the year king Achaz died was this prophecy [given].
023	ISA	014	029	Rejoice not, thou entire Palestine, because the rod of him that smote thee is broken; for out of the serpent's root shall come forth an adder, and its fruit shall be a flying dragon.
023	ISA	014	030	And the first-born of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall rest in safety: and I will kill with famine thy root, and men shall slay thy remnant.
023	ISA	014	031	Wail, O gate; cry out, O city; thou art dissolved, O thou entire Palestine; for from the north a smoke is coming, and there is no one solitary among those that are bidden to come.
023	ISA	014	032	And what will each one of the messengers of the nation answer? That the Lord hath founded Zion; and that therein shall find protection the poor of his people.
023	ISA	015	001	The doom of Moab. Truly in a night is 'Ar of Moab plundered, it is laid waste; truly in a night is Kir of Moab plundered, it is laid waste.
023	ISA	015	002	It goeth up to the [idol-]house, and Dibon [goeth] up to the high-places to weep, on Nebo and on Medeba shall Moab wail: on all its heads there is baldness, and every beard is hewn off.
023	ISA	015	003	In its streets they are girded with sack-cloth, on its roofs, and in its public places every one shall wail, groan with weeping.
023	ISA	015	004	And loud crieth Cheshbon with El'aleh; as far as Yahaz is heard their voice: therefore the armed men of Moab shall howl; its soul is grieved for itself.
023	ISA	015	005	My heart will cry for Moab, whose fugitives are as far as Zo'ar, [and] the third 'Eglarth; for the ascent of Luchith—with weeping is it ascended; for on the way to Choronayim they let resound the cry of defeat [in battle].
023	ISA	015	006	For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate; for dry is the grass, gone are the herbs, and green things are no more.
023	ISA	015	007	Therefore the rest of their acquisitions and what they possess shall they carry away over the brook of the willows.
023	ISA	015	008	For the cry hath encompassed the boundary of Moab; up to Eglayim [is heard] its wail, and at Beer-elim [is heard] its wail.
023	ISA	015	009	For the waters of Dimon are filled with blood; for I will bring over Dimon armed bands; over the escaped of Moab [cometh] a lion, and over the remnant of the land.
023	ISA	016	001	Send ye the lambs of the ruler of the land from Sela', through the wilderness, unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.
023	ISA	016	002	For it shall be, that, as a fugitive bird, as a chased nest, so shall be the daughters of Moab at the fords of Arnon.
023	ISA	016	003	Bring counsel, execute justice; render like the night thy shadow in the midst of the noonday; conceal the outcasts; betray not the fugitive.
023	ISA	016	004	Let my outcasts sojourn with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them from the face of the waster: till ceaseth the extortion, past be the wasting, and vanished be the oppressor out of the land.
023	ISA	016	005	And there shall be founded through kindness a throne; and there shall sit upon it in truthfulness in the tent of David a judge who seeketh justice, and is quick in righteousness.
023	ISA	016	006	We have heard of the pride of Moab; [that] he is very proud: of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath, his groundless lies.
023	ISA	016	007	Therefore shall Moab wail for Moab, every one shall wail; for the strong walls of Kir-charesseth shall ye lament, deeply stricken.
023	ISA	016	008	For the fields of Cheshbon are withered, the vine of Sibmah —the lords of nations have beaten down its branches, they did reach as far as Ya'zer, into the wilderness did they wander; its tendrils were stretched forth, they passed over the sea.
023	ISA	016	009	Therefore will I weep, when weeping for Ya'zer, for the vine of Sibmah: I will moisten thee richly with my tears, O Cheshbon, and El'aleh; for over [the gathering of] thy summer fruits and over thy harvest the battle-cry is fallen.
023	ISA	016	010	And [thus] are taken away joy and gladness out of the fruitful field; and in the vineyards shall be no singing, shall be no joyful shout: in the presses shall the treader not tread out wine; I have stopped the harvest-call.
023	ISA	016	011	Therefore my bowels shall groan for Moab like a harp, and my inward parts for Kir-charess.
023	ISA	016	012	And it shall come to pass, that it shall be seen that Moab is weary on the high-places; and he will come to his sanctuary to pray; but he shall not accomplish [aught].
023	ISA	016	013	This is the word that the Lord hath spoken concerning Moab in former times.
023	ISA	016	014	But now hath the Lord spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of a hired laborer, shall the glory of Moab be rendered mean with all this [his] great multitude; and the remnant shall be very small and inconsiderable.
023	ISA	017	001	The doom of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is deprived of being a city, and it shall become decaying ruins.
023	ISA	017	002	Forsaken are the cities of 'Aro'er: they shall be [given up] to flocks, which shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid.
023	ISA	017	003	And there shall cease the fortress from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria: like the glory of the children of Israel shall they be, saith the Lord of hosts.
023	ISA	017	004	And it shall come to pass on that day, that the glory of Jacob shall vanish, and the fatness of his flesh shall become lean.
023	ISA	017	005	And it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the standing-corn, and reapeth the ears with his arm; and it shall be as when one gleaneth ears in the valley of Rephaim.
023	ISA	017	006	And there shall be left on it gleaning-fruit, as one shaketh an olive-tree, two or three berries on the top of the uppermost bough, four or five on the outmost branches of a fruitful tree, saith the Lord the God of Israel.
023	ISA	017	007	On that day shall a man turn his regard up to his Maker, and his eyes shall look toward the Holy One of Israel.
023	ISA	017	008	And he shall not turn his regard to the altars, the work of his hands; and he shall not look at what his fingers have made, both the groves and the sun-images.
023	ISA	017	009	On that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken ruin in a forest, and on a mountain-peak, which they left because of the children of Israel: and the land shall be desolate.
023	ISA	017	010	Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, and the rock of thy strength thou hast not remembered; therefore wouldst thou plant luxuriant plantings, and wouldst set out the shoots of the stranger therein.
023	ISA	017	011	[Already] on the day that thou plantedst thou causedst to grow, and in the morning thou madest thy seed to blossom; but now fleeth the harvest on the day of disease and of incurable pain.
023	ISA	017	012	Woe to the raging of many people, who rage like the raging of the seas; and to the noise of nations, that make a noise like the roar of mighty waters!
023	ISA	017	013	The nations will make a noise like the roaring of many waters; but He will rebuke it, and it shall flee afar off, and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and as thistle-down before the tempest.
023	ISA	017	014	At eveningtide, behold, there is trouble; before yet it is morning it is no more. This is the portion of our spoilers, and the lot of those that plunder us.
023	ISA	018	001	Woe to the land with spreading wings, which is beyond the rivers of Cush,
023	ISA	018	002	That sendeth on the sea ambassadors, and in vessels of bulrushes messengers over the face of the waters. Go, ye swift messengers, to a nation pulled and torn, to a people terrible from their beginning and onward; a nation meted out and trodden down, whose land the rivers have spoiled!
023	ISA	018	003	All ye inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on the earth, when the ensign is lifted up on the mountains, see ye; and when the cornet is blown, hear ye.
023	ISA	018	004	For so hath said the Lord unto me, I will take my rest, and I will look down on my dwelling-place like a clear heat upon herbs, and like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.
023	ISA	018	005	For before the harvest, when the blossom is past, and the flower becometh a ripening grape, will he both cut off the tendrils with pruning-knives, and the sprigs will he remove and cut down.
023	ISA	018	006	They shall be left together unto the birds of prey of the mountains, and to the beasts of the earth: and the birds of prey shall summer upon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them.
023	ISA	018	007	At that time shall be brought as a present unto the Lord of hosts a people pulled and torn, and a people terrible from their beginning and onward; a nation meted out and trodden under foot, whose land the rivers have spoiled, to the place of the name of the Lord of hosts, the mount Zion.
023	ISA	019	001	The doom of Egypt. Behold, the Lord rideth upon a swift cloud, and is coming to Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall be moved because of his presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in its inward parts.
023	ISA	019	002	And I will stir up Egyptians against Egyptians: and they shall fight every one against his brother, and every one against his fellow; city against city, kingdom against kingdom.
023	ISA	019	003	And the spirit of Egypt shall be emptied out in its inward parts, and its counsel will I frustrate; and they will inquire of the idols, and of the charmers, and of those that have familiar spirits, and of the wizards.
023	ISA	019	004	And I will surrender the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel lord; and a rigorous king shall rule over them, saith the Lord, the Eternal of hosts.
023	ISA	019	005	And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and dried up.
023	ISA	019	006	And the rivers shall become foul; and shallow and dried up shall become the deep streams: reeds and flags shall wither.
023	ISA	019	007	The well-rooted plants by the stream, by the mouth of the stream, and every thing sown by the stream, shall dry up, be scattered [by the wind,] and be no more.
023	ISA	019	008	The fishermen also shall lament, and all they that cast an angle into the stream shall mourn; and they that spread nets upon the face of the waters shall languish.
023	ISA	019	009	And ashamed shall be they that work in fine flax, and they that weave white cloth.
023	ISA	019	010	And its foundations shall be beaten down, all that build sluices shall be grieved in soul.
023	ISA	019	011	Surely fools are the princes of Zo'an! the wise of the counsellors of Pharaoh [impart] silly counsel: how can ye say unto Pharaoh, I am a son of the wise, a son of the ancient kings?
023	ISA	019	012	Where are they, these, thy wise men? that they may tell thee now, that they know what the Lord of hosts hath resolved on over Egypt.
023	ISA	019	013	The princes of Zo'an are become fools, deceived are the princes of Noph; and Egypt is led astray by the chiefs of its tribes.
023	ISA	019	014	The Lord hath poured out in the midst thereof a spirit of perverseness: and they have led Egypt astray in all its work, as a drunkard reeleth astray in his vomit.
023	ISA	019	015	And there shall not be for Egypt [successful] work, which the head or tail, palm-branch or rush, may do.
023	ISA	019	016	On that day shall Egypt be like the women: and it shall tremble and be in dread because of the waving of the hand of the Lord of hosts, which he waveth over it.
023	ISA	019	017	And the land of Judah shall become unto Egypt a terror, every one that maketh mention thereof shall be in dread, because of the counsel of the Lord of hosts, which he hath resolved against it.
023	ISA	019	018	On that day shall be five cities in the land of Egypt speaking the language of Canaan, and swearing by the Lord of hosts; “The city of destruction” shall one be called.
023	ISA	019	019	On that day shall there be all altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at its border to the Lord.
023	ISA	019	020	And it shall be for a sign and for a testimony unto the Lord of hosts in the land of Egypt; for they shall cry unto the Lord because of the oppressors, and he will send them a helper, and a chief, and he shall deliver them.
023	ISA	019	021	And the Lord will be made known to the Egyptians, and the Egyptians shall know the Lord on that day, and will do service [with] sacrifice and oblation; yea, they will make vows unto the Lord and perform [them].
023	ISA	019	022	And the Lord will thus strike Egypt, striking and healing it: and they will return unto the Lord, and he will be entreated of them, and heal them.
023	ISA	019	023	On that day there shall be a highway out of Egypt to Asshur, and Asshur shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptians into Asshur, and the Egyptians shall serve with Asshur [the Lord].
023	ISA	019	024	On that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Asshur, a blessing in the midst of the earth.
023	ISA	019	025	Whom the Lord of hosts will have blessed, saying, Blessed be my people Egypt, and Asshur the work of my hands, and my heritage Israel.
023	ISA	020	001	In the year that Tharthan came unto Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him, and fought against Ashdod, and captured it;
023	ISA	020	002	At the same time spoke the Lord by means of Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go and loosen the sackcloth from off thy loins, and thy shoe shalt thou pull off from thy foot. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.
023	ISA	020	003	And the Lord said, Just as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years as a sign and token for Egypt and for Cush:
023	ISA	020	004	So shall the king of Assyria lead away the prisoners of Egypt, and the exiles of Cush, young and old, naked and barefoot, even with uncovered buttocks, to the disgrace of Egypt.
023	ISA	020	005	And they shall be terrified, and ashamed of Cush their trust, and of Egypt their vaunt.
023	ISA	020	006	And the inhabitant of this isle shall say on that day, Behold, such is our trust, whither we fled for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria: and how shall we then escape?
023	ISA	021	001	The doom of the desert by the sea. As tempests in the south blow with fury; so doth it come from the desert, from a terrible land.
023	ISA	021	002	A hard vision hath been told unto me; the traitor dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. “Go up, O 'Elam; besiege, O Media;” all sighing have I caused to cease.
023	ISA	021	003	Therefore are my loins filled with pain; pangs have seized me, like the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I am too much cramped to hear; I am too much dismayed to see.
023	ISA	021	004	My heart wandereth astray, dread affrighteth me: the evening of my pleasure hath he turned unto me into terror.
023	ISA	021	005	Prepare the table, put on the candlesticks, eat, drink: arise, ye princes, and anoint the shield.
023	ISA	021	006	For thus hath said unto me the Lord, Go, set the watchman, what he seeth let him tell.
023	ISA	021	007	And he will see chariots, horsemen in couples, riders on asses, riders on camels; and he shall listen diligently with much heed:
023	ISA	021	008	And he calleth [like] a lion, Upon the watchtower, O Lord, do I stand continually in the daytime, and on my ward am I set all the nights.
023	ISA	021	009	And, behold, here cometh a chariot with men, horsemen in couples, and he commenceth and saith, Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the graven images of her gods hath he shivered unto the ground.
023	ISA	021	010	O my down-trodden [people,] and the son of my threshingfloor: that which I have heard from the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, have I told unto you.
023	ISA	021	011	The doom of Dumah. Unto me one calleth out of Se'ir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?
023	ISA	021	012	The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will desire, desire ye; return, come again.
023	ISA	021	013	The doom upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye caravans of Dedanim.
023	ISA	021	014	Toward him that is thirsty they bring water; the inhabitants of the land of Thema meet with suitable bread the fugitive.
023	ISA	021	015	Because from the swords are they fled, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the pressure of war.
023	ISA	021	016	For thus hath said the Lord unto me, Within yet one year, like the years of a hired laborer, shall all the glory of Kedar be at an end:
023	ISA	021	017	And the residue of the number of bows of the mighty men of the children of Kedar shall be small; for the Lord the God of Israel hath spoken it.
023	ISA	022	001	The doom of the valley of vision. What aileth thee now, that thou art wholly gone up to the roofs?
023	ISA	022	002	O noiseful, tumultuous city, joyous town? thy slain ones are not slain with the sword, and not those that die in battle.
023	ISA	022	003	All thy rulers are fled together, they are made prisoners by the bowmen: all that are found in thee are made prisoners together, who have run away from afar.
023	ISA	022	004	Therefore said I, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly; be not urgent to comfort me, because of the wasting of the daughter of my people.
023	ISA	022	005	For a day of confusion, and of treading down, and of perplexity hath the Lord Eternal of hosts in the valley of vision; walls are broken, and crying is heard against the mountain.
023	ISA	022	006	And 'Elam beareth the quiver, [cometh] with men in chariots and horsemen, and Kir uncovereth the shield.
023	ISA	022	007	And it is so, that thy choicest valleys are full of chariots, and the horsemen set themselves in array against the gate.
023	ISA	022	008	And he laid open the covering of Judah; and thou didst look on that day toward the armor of the house of the forest.
023	ISA	022	009	And the breaches of the city of David have ye seen, that they are many: and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool.
023	ISA	022	010	And the houses of Jerusalem have ye numbered, and ye have pulled down the houses to fortify the wall.
023	ISA	022	011	And a tank have ye made between the two walls for the water of the old pool; but ye have not looked at the Maker thereof, him that fashioned it in distant times have ye not regarded.
023	ISA	022	012	And the Lord Eternal of hosts called on that day for weeping, and for mourning, and for baldness, and for girding with sackcloth.
023	ISA	022	013	And behold [there are] gladness and joy, slaying of oxen, and killing of sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine: “Let us eat and drink; for tomorrow we must die.”
023	ISA	022	014	And it was revealed in my ears by the Lord of hosts: Surely this iniquity shall not be forgiven unto you until ye die, said the Lord the Eternal of hosts.
023	ISA	022	015	Thus hath said the Lord, Go, get thee unto this treasurer, even unto Shebna, who is [superintendent] over the house;
023	ISA	022	016	What hast thou here? and whom hast thou here, that thou hast hewn out for thyself here a sepulchre, [the man] that hath hewn out on high his sepulchre, that holloweth out in the rock a habitation for himself?
023	ISA	022	017	Behold, the Lord will thrust thee about with a mighty throw, O man! and will lay fast hold of thee;
023	ISA	022	018	He will roll thee up as a bundle, and [toss thee] like a ball into a country of ample space: there shalt thou die, and there shall [remain] the chariots of thy glory, thou disgrace of the house of thy lord.
023	ISA	022	019	And I will cast thee out from thy station, and from thy post shall he pull thee down.
023	ISA	022	020	And it shall come to pass on that day, that I will call my servant, for Elyakim the son of Chilkiyahu.
023	ISA	022	021	And I will clothe him with thy robe, and thy girdle will I fasten around him, and thy government will I place into his hand: and he shall be as a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah.
023	ISA	022	022	And I will lay the key of the house of David upon his shoulder; so that he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open.
023	ISA	022	023	And I will fasten him as a tent-nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a chair of honor to his father's house.
023	ISA	022	024	And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's house, the shoots and offshoots, all the small vessels, from the vessels of basins, even to all the vessels of flagons.
023	ISA	022	025	On that day, saith the Lord of hosts, shall be removed the nail that is fastened in the sure place, and be cut down, and fall; and the burden that is upon it shall be cut off; for the Lord hath spoken it.
023	ISA	023	001	The doom of Tyre. Wail, ye ships of Tharshish; for it is laid waste, without house, without entrance: from the land of Kittim hath it been revealed to them.
023	ISA	023	002	Be silent, ye inhabitants of the coast-land: the merchants of Zidon, that pass over the sea [formerly] filled thee.
023	ISA	023	003	And on mighty waters [came] the seed of Shichor, the harvest of the stream, as her revenue; and she became the mart of nations.
023	ISA	023	004	Be ashamed, O Zion; for spoken hath the sea, the stronghold of the sea, saying, I travailed not, nor brought forth children, neither did I nourish up young men, nor bring up virgins.
023	ISA	023	005	As at the report concerning Egypt, so shall they tremble at the report of Tyre.
023	ISA	023	006	Pass ye over to Tharshish; wail, ye inhabitants of the coast-land.
023	ISA	023	007	Is this your fate, ye of the joyous [city]? she whose antiquity is of ancient days—her own feet shall carry her, afar off to sojourn.
023	ISA	023	008	Who hath resolved this against Tyre, the crowning city, whose merchants are princes, whose traders are the honorable of the earth?
023	ISA	023	009	The Lord hath resolved it, to dishonor the pride of all ornament, to make of light esteem all the honorable of the earth.
023	ISA	023	010	Pass through thy land as a stream, O daughter of Tharshish: there is no more strength.
023	ISA	023	011	He hath stretched out his hand over the sea, he hath shaken kingdoms; the Lord hath given a command against Canaan, to subvert its strongholds.
023	ISA	023	012	And he said, Thou shalt no longer rejoice any more, O thou oppressed virgin, daughter of Zidon: arise, pass over to the Kittim; also there shalt thou have no rest.
023	ISA	023	013	Behold the land of the Chaldeans—this people which was not, Asshur founded it for the dwellers in the wilderness—they have set up their watchtowers, have overthrown its palaces, have rendered it a heap of ruins.
023	ISA	023	014	Wail, ye ships of Tharshish; your stronghold is laid waste.
023	ISA	023	015	And it shall come to pass on that day, that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years, like the days of one king: at the end of seventy years shall it happen to Tyre as in the song of the harlot.
023	ISA	023	016	“Take the harp, go round about the city, thou forgotten harlot; make sweet music, sing many songs, in order that thou mayest be remembered.”
023	ISA	023	017	And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that the Lord will visit Tyre, and she shall return to her hire, and shall have commerce with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth.
023	ISA	023	018	And her gain and her hire shall be holy to the Lord: it shall not be treasured nor laid up; but for those that dwell before the Lord shall her gain be, to eat to fulness, and for magnificent clothing.
023	ISA	024	001	Behold, the Lord maketh empty the land, and layeth it waste, marreth its surface, and scattereth abroad its inhabitants.
023	ISA	024	002	And it shall be with the people as with the priest; with the servant as with his master; with the bondwoman as with her mistress; with the buyer as with the seller; with the lender as with the borrower; with the debtor as with his creditor.
023	ISA	024	003	Empty, emptied out shall be the land, and spoiled, utterly spoiled; for the Lord hath spoken this word.
023	ISA	024	004	The land mourneth, withereth away, the world languishes, withereth away, the high ones of the people of the land do languish.
023	ISA	024	005	For the land was defiled under its inhabitants; because they had transgressed the laws, neglected the statutes, broken the everlasting covenant.
023	ISA	024	006	Therefore hath the curse devoured the land, and they that dwell therein suffer for their guilt; therefore are the inhabitants of the land dried up, and but few men are left.
023	ISA	024	007	The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the merry-hearted sigh.
023	ISA	024	008	At rest is the mirth of the tambourines; ceased hath the tumult of the joyful; at rest is the mirth of the harp.
023	ISA	024	009	Amidst singing shall they no [more] drink wine; bitter shall be the strong drink to those that drink it.
023	ISA	024	010	Broken down is the city of desolation; shut up is every house that none can enter.
023	ISA	024	011	A [painful] cry for wine is in the streets; darkened is all joy; banished is the mirth of the land.
023	ISA	024	012	Destruction is left in the city, in ruins is beaten the gate.
023	ISA	024	013	For thus shall it be in the midst of the land among the nations, as [at] the shaking of an olive-tree, as [at] the gleaning of grains when the vintage is done.
023	ISA	024	014	These shall lift up their voice, they shall sing; because of the majesty of the Lord, they shout aloud from the sea.
023	ISA	024	015	Therefore in the valleys honor ye the Lord; in the isles of the sea, the name of the Lord the God of Israel.
023	ISA	024	016	From the edge of the earth have we heard songs, “Glory to the righteous.” But I said, “Evil is mine, evil is mine, woe is me! the treacherous have dealt treacherously; yea, the treacherous have dealt very treacherously.”
023	ISA	024	017	Fear, and the pit, and the snare are upon thee, O inhabitant of the land.
023	ISA	024	018	And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the call of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be caught in the snare; for the windows from on high are opened, and there quaked the foundations of the earth.
023	ISA	024	019	Crushed entirely is the earth, split in pieces is the earth, shaken to its centre is the earth.
023	ISA	024	020	The earth reeleth to and fro like a drunkard, and vibrateth like a watch-hut; and heavily lieth upon it its transgression; and it shall fall, and not rise again.
023	ISA	024	021	And it shall come to pass on that day, that the Lord will visit punishment on the host of heaven in heaven, and on the kings of the earth upon the earth.
023	ISA	024	022	And they shall be gathered in heaps, as prisoners, in the prison, and shall be shut up in the dungeon, and thus after many days shall they be punished.
023	ISA	024	023	And the moon shall be put to the blush, and the sun be made ashamed; for the Lord of hosts will reign on mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients in glory.
023	ISA	025	001	O Lord, my God art thou; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name; for thou hast done wonderful things, resolves of distant times [are become] faithful confirmation.
023	ISA	025	002	For thou hast made of a city a stone-heap; of a fortified town a falling ruin; the palace of barbarians ceaseth out of the city, to eternity shall it not be rebuilt.
023	ISA	025	003	Therefore shall a strong people honor thee; the town of the tyrannical nations shall fear thee.
023	ISA	025	004	For thou hast become a stronghold to the poor, a stronghold to the needy when he is distressed; a protection from the tempest, a shadow from the heat; for the [wrathful] breath of the tyrants is like the tempest against a wall.
023	ISA	025	005	Like heat in a dry land, wilt thou subdue the tumult of the barbarians; as the heat [is lessened] by the shadow of the cloud, so will he subdue the song of the tyrants.
023	ISA	025	006	And the Lord of hosts will make unto all the nations on this mountain a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.
023	ISA	025	007	And he will destroy on this mountain the face of the covering which covereth all the people, and the vail that is spread over all the nations.
023	ISA	025	008	He will destroy death to eternity: and the Lord Eternal will wipe away the tear from off all faces; and the shame of his people will he remove from off all the earth; for the Lord hath spoken it.
023	ISA	025	009	And men will say on that day, Lo, this is our God, for whom we have waited that he would help us; this is the Lord for whom we have waited, we will be glad and we will rejoice in his salvation.
023	ISA	025	010	For the hand of the Lord will rest on this mountain, and Moab shall be trodden down on his own place, even as straw is trodden down upon the dunghill.
023	ISA	025	011	And he will spread forth his hands in the midst thereof, as the swimmer spreadeth them forth to swim: and he will bring down his pride together with the joints of his hands.
023	ISA	025	012	And the fortress of the stronghold of thy walls he bringeth down, layeth low, casteth it to the ground, even to the dust.
023	ISA	026	001	On that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah: A strong city have we; his aid will he grant [us] as walls and defence.
023	ISA	026	002	Open ye the gates, that there may enter in the righteous nation which guardeth the truth.
023	ISA	026	003	The confiding mind wilt thou keep in perfect peace; because he trusteth in thee.
023	ISA	026	004	Trust ye in the Lord unto eternity; for in Yah the Lord is everlasting protection.
023	ISA	026	005	For he bendeth down the dwellers of the height; the lofty fortress—he layeth it low; he layeth it low, along the ground; he casteth it down to the dust.
023	ISA	026	006	The foot shall tread it down, the feet of the poor, the steps of the needy.
023	ISA	026	007	The path of the just is straight: thou, most upright, dost ever level the road of the just.
023	ISA	026	008	Yea, on the path of thy judgments, O Lord, have we waited for thee; for thy name, and for the remembrance of thee, was the longing of our soul.
023	ISA	026	009	In my soul have I longed for thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek for thee; for when thy judgments are [sent] on the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.
023	ISA	026	010	If favor be shown to the wicked, he will not learn righteousness; in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, and will not regard the majesty of the Lord.
023	ISA	026	011	Lord, thy hand was raised high, but they would not see: oh that they might see, and be ashamed, [thy] zeal for the people; yea, the fire which shall devour them—thy enemies.
023	ISA	026	012	Lord, thou wilt ordain peace for us; for also all our works hast thou accomplished for us.
023	ISA	026	013	O Lord our God, lords have had dominion over us beside thee; [but] of thee only would we make mention, —of thy name.
023	ISA	026	014	[They are] dead, they will not live [again]; [they are] departed, they will not rise [again]; therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made to perish every memorial of them.
023	ISA	026	015	Thou hast done more for the nation, O Lord, thou hast done more for the nation; thou hast glorified thyself: thou hast enlarged all the ends of the earth.
023	ISA	026	016	Lord, in trouble have they sought thee, they poured out earnest prayers when thy chastening was upon them.
023	ISA	026	017	Like as a pregnant woman, that is near giving birth, is in pain, [and] crieth out in her pangs: so have we been in thy presence, O Lord.
023	ISA	026	018	We have been pregnant and in pain, [but it was] as though we brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance in the land; and the inhabitants of the world have not fallen.
023	ISA	026	019	Thy dead shall live, my dead bodies shall arise. Awake and sing ye, that dwell in the dust; for a dew on herbs is thy dew, and the earth shall cast out the departed.
023	ISA	026	020	Go, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy door behind thee: hide thyself but for a little moment, until the indignation be passed away.
023	ISA	026	021	For, behold, the Lord cometh out of his place to visit the iniquity of the inhabitants of the earth on them: and the earth shall disclose her blood, and shall no more be a cover over her slain.
023	ISA	027	001	On that day will the Lord punish with his heavy and great and strong sword leviathan the flying serpent, and leviathan the crooked servant; and he will slay the crocodile that is in the sea.
023	ISA	027	002	On that day sing ye a song of the vineyard of excellent wine.
023	ISA	027	003	“I the Lord do keep it; every moment will I water it: that no one shall hurt it, night and day will I keep it.
023	ISA	027	004	Wrath have I not: who would set the briers and thorns against me in battle? I would pass through them, and I would burn them altogether.
023	ISA	027	005	If he but take hold of my strength, make peace with me; make peace with me.”
023	ISA	027	006	In the future shall Jacob yet take root; Israel shall bud and blossom, and shall fill the face of the world with fruit.
023	ISA	027	007	Hath he smitten him, as he smote the one that smote him? or was he slain with the same slaughter as those of him that were slain?
023	ISA	027	008	In measure, by driving him forth, thou strivest with him: he removed him with his violent storm on the day of the east wind.
023	ISA	027	009	Therefore by this [only] shall the iniquity of Jacob be atoned; and this shall be all the fruit of the taking away of his sin; when he maketh all the stones of the altar as limestones that are beaten in pieces, when there shall not arise again any groves and sun-images.
023	ISA	027	010	For [by this] the fortified city shall be desolate, the habitation be forsaken, and left like a wilderness; there shall the calf feed, and there shall it lie down, and consume its branches.
023	ISA	027	011	When its boughs are withered, they shall be broken off; women will come and set them on fire; for it is not a people of understanding; therefore he that made it will not have mercy on it, and he that formed it will show it no favor.
023	ISA	027	012	And it shall come to pass on that day, that the Lord will beat off [the fruit] from the channel of the River up to the brook of Egypt; but ye shall be gathered up one by one, ye children of Israel.
023	ISA	027	013	And it shall come to pass on that day, that the great cornet shall be blown, and then shall come those who are lost in the land of Asshur, and those who are outcasts in the land of Egypt, and they shall prostrate themselves before the Lord on the holy mount at Jerusalem.
023	ISA	028	001	Woe to the crown of pride, of the drunkards of Ephraim, and to the fading flower of his glorious ornament, which is on the eminence of the fat valley of those who are struck down by wine!
023	ISA	028	002	Behold, [it cometh] mighty and strong from the Lord, as a tempest of hail, a storm of destruction; as a tempest of mighty overflowing waters, will he cast it down to the earth with force.
023	ISA	028	003	Under feet shall be trodden the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim:
023	ISA	028	004	And the fading flower of his glorious ornament, which is on the eminence of the fat valley, shall be as its early ripe fruit before the summer; which one, when he just seeth it, while it is scarcely in his hand, hastily devoureth.
023	ISA	028	005	On that day will the Lord of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people,
023	ISA	028	006	And for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment, and for strength to those that drive back the battle to the gate [of the enemy].
023	ISA	028	007	But these also are now stumbling through wine, and reeling through strong drink: priest and prophet are stumbling through strong drink, they are overpowered with wine, they reel through strong drink; they stumble in [divine] vision, they are unsteady in giving judgment.
023	ISA	028	008	For all tables are full of vomit of filthiness, there is no place [clean].
023	ISA	028	009	Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he give to understand doctrine? those that are weaned from the milk, those that are taken from the breasts.
023	ISA	028	010	For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little.
023	ISA	028	011	For [as] with stammering lips and a foreign tongue will he speak to this people;
023	ISA	028	012	When he said unto them, This is the rest, cause ye the weary to rest; and this is the refreshing; but they would not hear.
023	ISA	028	013	Therefore shall be unto them the word of the Lord, precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little; in order that they may go, and stumble backward, and be broken, and snared, and caught.
023	ISA	028	014	Therefore hear the word of the Lord, ye scornful men, who rule this people that is in Jerusalem.
023	ISA	028	015	Because ye have said, “We have entered into a covenant with death, and with the nether world have we made an agreement; the overflowing scourge, when it passeth by, shall not come at us; for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we sought a hiding-place.”
023	ISA	028	016	Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I have laid in Zion as a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a costly corner-stone, well founded: he that believeth will not make haste.
023	ISA	028	017	And I will make of justice a measuring line, and of righteousness a plummet: and the hail shall sweep off the refuge of lies, and the hiding-place against the waters shall these flood away.
023	ISA	028	018	And your covenant with death shall be annulled, and your agreement with the nether world shall not have permanence; the overflowing scourge, when it passeth by—then shall ye be trodden down by it.
023	ISA	028	019	As often as it passeth by shall it take you; for morning by morning shall it pass by, by day and by night; and the mere understanding of the report shall cause terror.
023	ISA	028	020	For the bed shall be too short for [a man] to stretch himself out [on it]: and the covering too narrow to wrap himself in.
023	ISA	028	021	For as on mount Perazim will the Lord rise up, as in the valley of Gib'on will he be wroth, that he may do his work, his singular work; and to accomplish his labor, his strange labor.
023	ISA	028	022	And now be ye no longer scornful, lest your bonds be made strong; for as completed and fully decreed have I heard it from the Lord Eternal of hosts over all the earth.
023	ISA	028	023	Give ye ear, and hear my voice; listen, and hear my speech.
023	ISA	028	024	Doth the ploughman plough all the time to sow? doth he open and harrow his ground [continually]?
023	ISA	028	025	Is it not so? that, when he hath made level its surface he scattereth fennel, and streweth about cumin, and planteth the wheat in rows, and barley on its assigned [place], and millet on its proper spot?
023	ISA	028	026	For his God instructed him rightly, taught him [so to do].
023	ISA	028	027	Truly not with a threshing instrument is fennel threshed, and a wagon-wheel is not turned about upon cumin; but fennel is beaten out with a staff, and cumin with a stick.
023	ISA	028	028	Bread-corn is crushed; but not for ever doth [man] keep threshing it; and though he drive over it the wheel of his wagon and his horses, he will not [thereby] crush it.
023	ISA	028	029	This also cometh forth from the Lord of hosts; wonderful is he in counsel, and excellent in [his] wise deeds.
023	ISA	029	001	Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the town where David dwelt! add ye year to year; let the festivals come round in order;
023	ISA	029	002	Yet will I distress Ariel, and there shall be groaning and wailing: and it shall be unto me like Ariel.
023	ISA	029	003	And I will encamp against thee round about, and will lay siege against thee with hostile posts, and I will raise up entrenchments against thee.
023	ISA	029	004	And brought down low, shalt thou speak [as though] out of the earth, and out of the dust shall come forth thy speech; and like one of a familiar spirit out of the earth shall be thy voice, and out of the dust shalt thou whisper forth thy speech.
023	ISA	029	005	And like the small dust shall be the multitude of thy barbarian enemies, and like the passing chaff the multitude of tyrants; and [this] shall be at unawares, suddenly.
023	ISA	029	006	From the Lord of hosts shall the visitation come with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and the devouring flame of fire.
023	ISA	029	007	And as a dream of a night-vision shall be the multitude of all the nations that go to war against Ariel, even all that fight against her and raise towers against her, and that distress her.
023	ISA	029	008	And it shall even be as when a hungry man dreameth, that, behold, he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty; or as when a thirsty man dreameth, that, behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul yet longeth: so shall it be with the multitude of all the nations, that go to war against mount Zion.
023	ISA	029	009	Stay but still and wonder; turn your eyes away, and be blinded; they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.
023	ISA	029	010	For the Lord hath poured out over you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes: [over] the prophets, and your chiefs, the seers, hath he cast a vail.
023	ISA	029	011	And the vision of every thing is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that can read, saying, Read this, I pray thee; and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed:
023	ISA	029	012	And the book is then delivered to one that cannot read, saying, Read this, I pray thee; and he saith, I cannot read.
023	ISA	029	013	And the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near with their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is but the acquired precept of men;
023	ISA	029	014	Therefore, behold, I will do yet farther a marvelous work with this people, doing wonder on wonder; so that the wisdom of their wise men shall be lost, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hidden.
023	ISA	029	015	Woe unto those that seek to hide deeply their counsel from the Lord, so that their works may be in the dark, and they say, Who seeth us? and who knoweth us?
023	ISA	029	016	Oh your perverseness! shall the potter be esteemed as the clay? that the work shall say of its maker, He hath not made me? or shall the thing framed say of its framer, He had no understanding?
023	ISA	029	017	Lo! but yet a very little while more, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest!
023	ISA	029	018	And on that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and out of obscurity, and out of darkness, shall the eyes of the blind see.
023	ISA	029	019	And the sufferers shall have abundant joy in the Lord, and the needy among men shall be glad in the Holy One of Israel.
023	ISA	029	020	For the tyrant is no more, and consumed is the scorner, and cut off are all that watch for injustice;
023	ISA	029	021	That cause mankind to sin by [their] word; and lay a snare for him that reproveth [them] in the gate; and pervert through fraud the cause of the just.
023	ISA	029	022	Therefore thus hath said the Lord unto the house of Jacob, he who hath redeemed Abraham, Not now shall Jacob be ashamed, and not now shall his face be made pale.
023	ISA	029	023	For when he seeth his children, the work of my hands in the midst of him, how they sanctify my name: then will they sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and the God of Israel will they reverence.
023	ISA	029	024	They also that were erring in spirit shall acquire understanding, and they that murmured shall obtain instruction.
023	ISA	030	001	Woe to the rebellious children, saith the Lord, that take counsel, but not from me; and that set themselves a ruler, but not by my spirit, in order that they may add sin to sin:
023	ISA	030	002	That travel to go down into Egypt, and have not asked my will; to strengthen themselves through the strength of Pharaoh, and to seek shelter in the shadow of Egypt!
023	ISA	030	003	Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh become your shame, and the shelter in the shadow of Egypt your disgrace.
023	ISA	030	004	For his princes were at Zo'an, and his ambassadors had reached Chanes.
023	ISA	030	005	They all are ashamed because of a people that cannot profit them, neither be a help nor give profit; but [bringeth] shame, and also a reproach.
023	ISA	030	006	The doom of the beasts of the south: Through the land of trouble and anguish, whence come the lioness and the lion, the viper and flying dragons, they will carry upon the shoulders of young asses their riches, and upon the humps of camels their treasures, to a people that cannot profit.
023	ISA	030	007	And the Egyptians will help in vain, and to no purpose; therefore have I called this, Boasters they are in sitting still.
023	ISA	030	008	Now go, write it before them on a table, and note it in a book, that it may be for the latest time to come, for ever, and to eternity:
023	ISA	030	009	For this is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the law of the Lord:
023	ISA	030	010	Who have said to the seers, Ye shall not see; and to the prophets, Reveal not unto us true things, speak unto us smooth things, reveal deceits;
023	ISA	030	011	Depart you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, remove from before us the Holy One of Israel.
023	ISA	030	012	Therefore thus hath said the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and lean thereon for aid:
023	ISA	030	013	Therefore shall this iniquity be to you as a threatening breach, swelling out in a high-towering wall, the fall of which will come unawares, suddenly.
023	ISA	030	014	And he will break it, as one breaketh a potter's vessel, dashing it in pieces without sparing it; so that there cannot be found among its fragments a sherd to rake fire from a hearth and to draw water from a pit.
023	ISA	030	015	For thus hath said the Lord Eternal, the Holy One of Israel, In repose and rest shall ye be helped; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength; and ye would not.
023	ISA	030	016	And ye said, “No; for upon horses will we flee;” therefore shall ye flee: and, “Upon swift beasts will we ride;” therefore shall your pursuers be swift.
023	ISA	030	017	One thousand [shall flee] at the threatening of one; at the threatening of five shall ye [all] flee: till ye be left as a pole upon a mountain-top, and as an ensign on a hill.
023	ISA	030	018	And therefore will the Lord wait, to be gracious unto you, and therefore will he exalt himself, to have mercy upon you; for a God of justice is the Lord: happy are all those that wait for him.
023	ISA	030	019	For O people of Zion that shall dwell at Jerusalem! thou shalt indeed not weep: he will be surely gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry; so soon as he heareth it, he answereth thee.
023	ISA	030	020	And the Lord will give you bread [in] adversity, and water [in] oppression; and thy teachers shall not have to hide themselves in a corner any more, but thy eyes shall see thy teachers:
023	ISA	030	021	And thy ears shall hear the word behind thee, saying, “This is the way, walk ye in it,” when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.
023	ISA	030	022	And ye will regard as unclean the covering of thy graven idols of silver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou wilt cast them away as a filthy thing; “Get thee hence,” wilt thou say unto them.
023	ISA	030	023	Then will he give the rain for thy seed, that thou mayest sow in the ground; and bread—the produce of the ground—this shall be fat and nutritious: thy cattle shall feed on that day in extensive pastures.
023	ISA	030	024	The oxen likewise and the young asses that till the ground shall eat salted provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan.
023	ISA	030	025	And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every prominent hill, rivulets, streams of waters on the day of the great slaughter, when towers fall.
023	ISA	030	026	And the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of the seven days, on the day that the Lord bindeth up the broken [limbs] of his people, and healeth the bruise of their wound.
023	ISA	030	027	Behold, the name of the Lord cometh from afar, burning is his anger, and heavy the smoke; his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue is like a devouring fire;
023	ISA	030	028	And his breath, like an overflowing stream, shall reach to the midst of the neck, to toss the nations with the van of falsehood: and [to place] a deceiving bridle on the jaws of the people.
023	ISA	030	029	[Then] shall ye have a song, as in the night when a festival is ushered in, and joy of heart, as when one goeth with the flute to come unto the mountain of the Lord, to the Rock of Israel.
023	ISA	030	030	And the Lord will cause his majestic voice to be heard, and will show the stretching down of his arm, in the indignation of [his] anger, and in the flame of a devouring fire, in flood, and tempest, and stones of hail.
023	ISA	030	031	For because of the voice of the Lord shall be terrified Asshur, that smote [you] with the rod.
023	ISA	030	032	And at every passage of the appointed staff which the Lord will let fall on him, there shall be [music] on tambourine and harp; and in the tumult of battles will he fight with them.
023	ISA	030	033	For already of old is Topheth made ready; also this is prepared for the king—deep and wide; its pile hath fire and wood in plenty, the breath of the Lord, like a stream of sulfur, will kindle it into a flame.
023	ISA	031	001	Woe to those that go down to Egypt for help; and depend for support on horses, and trust on chariots, because they are many; and on horsemen, because they are very strong; but who turn not unto the Holy One of Israel, and seek not the Lord!
023	ISA	031	002	Yet he also is wise, and bringeth evil, and taketh not back his words; and riseth up against the house of evil-doers, and against the help of those that work injustice.
023	ISA	031	003	But the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses are flesh, and not spirit; and the Lord will stretch out his hand, and there shall stumble the helper, and he that is helped shall fall down, and they all shall perish together.
023	ISA	031	004	For thus hath said the Lord unto me, Just as the lion or the young lion growleth over his prey, against whom is called forth the company of shepherds, of whose voice he is not afraid, and is not depressed because of their multitude: thus will the Lord come down, to fight on mount Zion and on its hill.
023	ISA	031	005	As fluttering birds, so will the Lord of hosts shield Jerusalem; shielding and delivering; sparing and preserving.
023	ISA	031	006	Turn ye unto him from whom the children of Israel have deeply revolted.
023	ISA	031	007	For on that day shall every man despise his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made unto you for a sin.
023	ISA	031	008	Then shall Asshur fall by the sword of one who is not a man; and the sword of one who is not a son of earth shall devour him; and he shall flee him from the sword, and his young men shall become tributary.
023	ISA	031	009	And his stronghold shall pass away for fear, and his princes shall be terrified because of the ensign, saith the Lord, who hath a fire in Zion, and a furnace in Jerusalem.
023	ISA	032	001	Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in justice.
023	ISA	032	002	And every one shall be as a hiding-place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivulets of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a large rock in a languishing land.
023	ISA	032	003	And the eyes of those that see shall not be blinded again, and the ears of those that hear shall hearken.
023	ISA	032	004	The heart also of the rash shall be attentive in order to know, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.
023	ISA	032	005	The worthless person shall be no more called liberal, and the avaricious man shall not be said to be bountiful.
023	ISA	032	006	For the worthless person ever speaketh villany, and his heart will work injustice, to practise hypocrisy, and to speak error against the Lord, to leave empty the soul of the hungry, and the drink of the thirsty will he take away.
023	ISA	032	007	The instruments also of the avaricious man are evil: he deviseth wicked resolves to destroy the poor with words of falsehood, even when the needy speaketh what is right.
023	ISA	032	008	But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and he ever persisteth by liberal things.
023	ISA	032	009	Ye careless women rise up, hear my voice; ye daughters that are secure, give ear unto my speech.
023	ISA	032	010	After days and years shall ye shudder, ye women that are secure; for ended is the vintage, the fruit gathering shall nowise come.
023	ISA	032	011	Tremble, ye careless women; shudder, ye that are secure, strip off your garments and make yourselves bare, and gird [sackcloth] upon the loins.
023	ISA	032	012	[They shall strike] on the breast, lamenting, for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine.
023	ISA	032	013	Upon the soil of my people thorns and briers shall come up; yea, upon all the houses of joy of the gladsome town.
023	ISA	032	014	Because the palace is abandoned, the tumult of the city is forsaken; the hill and watch-tower are become dens for a long time, a joyous haunt for wild asses, a pasture for flocks.
023	ISA	032	015	Until a spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness be changed into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be accounted as a forest.
023	ISA	032	016	Then shall justice dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness abide in the fruitful field.
023	ISA	032	017	And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and security for ever.
023	ISA	032	018	And then shall my people abide in peaceful dwellings, and secure abodes, and in undisturbed resting-places.
023	ISA	032	019	And it shall spread itself out in the declivity of the forest; and far down in the lowlands shall the city descend.
023	ISA	032	020	Happy are ye that sow beside all waters, freely sending forth the feet of the ox and the ass.
023	ISA	033	001	Woe to thee that wastest, while thou wast not wasted; and traitor, while men dealt not treacherously with thee! when thou shalt have made an end of wasting, thou shalt be wasted, and when thou shalt have finished to deal treacherously, men shall deal treacherously with thee.
023	ISA	033	002	O Lord, be gracious; we have waited for thee: be thou their support every morning, also our salvation in the time of trouble.
023	ISA	033	003	At the noise of [thy] thunder people fled; when thou liftedst thyself up nations were scattered.
023	ISA	033	004	And your spoil shall be gathered as the cricket gathereth: as locusts run about, so shall people hasten after it.
023	ISA	033	005	The Lord is exalted; for he dwelleth on high; he hath filled Zion with justice and righteousness.
023	ISA	033	006	And the stability of thy times and the strength of thy happiness shall be wisdom and knowledge; the fear of the Lord is his treasure.
023	ISA	033	007	Behold, their valiant ones cry without: the ambassadors of peace weep bitterly.
023	ISA	033	008	The highways lie waste, ceased hath the wayfaring traveler: he hath broken the covenant, he despiseth cities, he regardeth not man.
023	ISA	033	009	It mourneth, it languisheth—the land: Lebanon is ashamed, it is withered away; Sharon is become like a wilderness; and bereft of their fruits are Bashan and Carmel.
023	ISA	033	010	Now will I arise, saith the Lord; now will I raise myself; now will I lift myself up.
023	ISA	033	011	Ye shall be pregnant with hay, [and] ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath is a fire, which shall devour you.
023	ISA	033	012	And the people shall be burnt as lime: as cut-off thorns shall they blaze up in fire.
023	ISA	033	013	Hear, ye distant ones, what I have done; and acknowledge ye that are near my might.
023	ISA	033	014	In Zion sinners are in dread; trembling hath seized on hypocrites. “Who among us shall abide with the devouring fire? who among us shall abide with everlasting burnings?”
023	ISA	033	015	He that walketh in righteousness, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands against taking hold of bribes, that stoppeth his ears against hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes against looking on evil;
023	ISA	033	016	He shall dwell on high; rocky strongholds shall be his refuge: his bread shall be given him; his water shall be sure.
023	ISA	033	017	The king in his beauty shall thy eyes behold: they shall see a far-off land.
023	ISA	033	018	Thy heart shall meditate [on past] terror. “Where is who wrote down? where is he that weighed? where is he that counted the towers?”
023	ISA	033	019	The barbarous people shalt thou not see any more, the people of a speech too obscure to be understood, of a stammering tongue, without meaning.
023	ISA	033	020	Look on Zion, the town of our solemn assemblies; thy eyes shall see Jerusalem as an undisturbed residence, a tent that shall not be struck for removal; not one of the stakes of which shall ever be moved, and all the cords of which shall never be torn loose.
023	ISA	033	021	But there will the Lord [show himself] mighty unto us, [in] a place of rivers and streams of ample breadth; wherein no oared galley shall go, and a gallant ship shall not pass thereby.
023	ISA	033	022	For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord is our king; he will save us.
023	ISA	033	023	Loose hang thy tacklings; they cannot well uphold strongly their mast, they cannot spread the sail. Then are divided booty and spoil in abundance, [even] the lame take the booty.
023	ISA	033	024	And no inhabitant shall say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be one whose iniquity is forgiven.
023	ISA	034	001	Come near, ye nations, to hear; and ye people, hearken: let the earth hear, and all that filleth it; the world, and all things that spring forth of it.
023	ISA	034	002	For the indignation of the Lord is [enkindled] over all the nations, and his fury over all their army: he hath devoted them, he hath given them up to the slaughter:
023	ISA	034	003	And their slain also shall be cast out, and as regardeth their carcasses their stench shall ascend upward, and the mountains shall be melted through their blood.
023	ISA	034	004	And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together like a book: and all their host shall wither, as the leaf withereth from the vine, and as withering fruit from the fig-tree.
023	ISA	034	005	For my sword is sated in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon Edom, and upon the people I have devoted to punishment.
023	ISA	034	006	The sword of the Lord is full of blood, it is enriched with fat, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams; for the Lord hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.
023	ISA	034	007	And wild oxen shall sink down with them, and steers with bullocks; and their land shall be sated with blood, and their dust enriched with fat.
023	ISA	034	008	For it is the day of vengeance unto the Lord, and the year of recompense for the controversy of Zion.
023	ISA	034	009	And its brooks shall be changed into pitch, and its dust into sulfur, and its land shall become burning pitch.
023	ISA	034	010	Night and day shall it not be quenched; for ever shall ascend the smoke thereof: from generation to generation shall it lie waste; no one shall for ever and ever pass through it.
023	ISA	034	011	But pelican and hedgehog shall take possession of it; night-owl also and raven shall dwell in it: and he shall stretch out over it the line of destruction, and the weights of desolation.
023	ISA	034	012	Their nobles—no one is there they could call [to] the kingdom, and all its princes shall be no more.
023	ISA	034	013	And thorns shall spring up in its palaces, nettles and brambles in its fortresses: and it shall be a habitation of monsters, and a court for ostriches.
023	ISA	034	014	And the martens shall meet with the jackals, and one goat shall call to his fellow; only the screech-owl shall rest there, and find for herself a place of repose.
023	ISA	034	015	There shall nestle the arrow-snake, and lay eggs, and hatch, and gather its young under its shadow: only vultures shall assemble there, every one with her mate.
023	ISA	034	016	Inquire out of the book of the Lord, and read: not one of these shall be absent, not one shall miss her mate; for my mouth it is that hath ordained it, and its breath it is that hath gathered them.
023	ISA	034	017	And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it out unto them by the measuring line: for ever shall they possess it, from generation to generation shall they dwell therein.
023	ISA	035	001	The wilderness and the dry land shall be glad thereat; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the lily.
023	ISA	035	002	It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice, yea, with joy and singing; the glory of the Lebanon shall be given unto it, the elegance of Carmel and Sharon; they indeed shall see the glory of the Lord, and the excellency of our God.
023	ISA	035	003	Strengthen ye weak hands, and stumbling knees make ye firm.
023	ISA	035	004	Say to the timid of heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God, [with] vengeance will he come, with God's recompense; it is he who will come and save you.
023	ISA	035	005	Then shall the eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.
023	ISA	035	006	Then shall the lame leap as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing; for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and brooks in the desert.
023	ISA	035	007	And the sandy waste shall be changed into a pool, and the thirsty land into springs of water: in the habitation of monsters, where each one used to lie, shall be a court for reeds and rushes.
023	ISA	035	008	And there shall be a highway and a way, and The holy way, shall it be called; no unclean one shall pass over it; but it shall be [only] theirs; the wayfaring man, and those unacquainted [therewith], shall not go astray.
023	ISA	035	009	No lion shall be there, and no ravenous beast shall go up thereon, shall not be found there; but there shall walk the redeemed:
023	ISA	035	010	And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with song, with everlasting joy upon their head; gladness and joy shall they obtain, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
023	ISA	036	001	And it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that Sennacherib the king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and seized on them.
023	ISA	036	002	And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to king Hezekiah with a strong army. And he halted by the aqueduct of the upper pool on the highway of the washer's field.
023	ISA	036	003	Then came forth unto him Elyakim, the son of Chilkiyahu, who was superintendent over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Yoach the son of Assaph, the recorder.
023	ISA	036	004	And Rabshakeh said unto them, —Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus hath said the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherewith thou hast trusted?
023	ISA	036	005	I have said, but it was only a word uttered with the lips, [I have] counsel and strength for the war. Now, on whom didst thou trust, that thou rebelledst against me?
023	ISA	036	006	Behold, thou trustedst on yon cracked reed-staff, on Egypt; which, if a man lean on it, will enter into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh the king of Egypt to all that trust on him.
023	ISA	036	007	But if thou shouldst say to me, In the Lord our God have we trusted: is he not the one whose high-places and whose altars Hezekiah hath removed, when he said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Before this altar shall ye prostrate yourselves?
023	ISA	036	008	And now I pray thee, enter into a contest with my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.
023	ISA	036	009	How then wilt thou turn back the face of a single chieftain of the least of my masters' servants, while thou hast put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
023	ISA	036	010	And now am I come up without the Lord ['s will] against this land to destroy it? The Lord hath said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.
023	ISA	036	011	Then said Elyakim and Shebna and Yoach unto Rabshakeh, Speak, we pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and speak not to us in the Jewish language, before the ears of the people that are on the wall.
023	ISA	036	012	But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master then sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words? is it not rather to the men who sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own excrements, and drink their own urine with you?
023	ISA	036	013	Then stood Rabshakeh up, and called out in a loud voice in the Jewish language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.
023	ISA	036	014	Thus hath said the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you;
023	ISA	036	015	Neither let Hezekiah induce you to trust in the Lord, saying, The Lord will surely deliver us; this city shall not be given up into the hand of the king of Assyria.
023	ISA	036	016	Hearken not to Hezekiah; for thus hath said the king of Assyria, Make a treaty of peace with me, and come out to me; and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern;
023	ISA	036	017	Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
023	ISA	036	018	So that Hezekiah may not mislead you, saying, The Lord will deliver us. Have the gods of the nations delivered each his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
023	ISA	036	019	Where are the gods of Chamath and Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvayim? and have they then delivered Samaria out of my hand?
023	ISA	036	020	Who are they among all the gods of these countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?
023	ISA	036	021	But they remained silent, and answered him not a word; for it was the king's command, saying, Ye shall not answer him.
023	ISA	036	022	Then came Elyakim the son of Chilkiyahu, that was superintendent over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Yoach the son of Assaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent; and they told him the words of Rabshakeh.
023	ISA	037	001	And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the Lord.
023	ISA	037	002	And he sent Elyakim, who was superintendent over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the son of Amoz, the prophet.
023	ISA	037	003	And they said unto him, Thus hath said Hezekiah, A day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of derision is this day; for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.
023	ISA	037	004	Perhaps the Lord thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to blaspheme the living God, and who hath reproached with the words which the Lord thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up a prayer for the remnant that is still found here.
023	ISA	037	005	And the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
023	ISA	037	006	And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say unto your master, Thus hath said the Lord, Be not afraid because of the words which thou hast heard, with which the boys of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
023	ISA	037	007	Behold, I will put an [other] spirit in him, and when he will hear a rumor, he shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
023	ISA	037	008	And Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.
023	ISA	037	009	And he heard it said of Thirhakah the king of Ethiopia, He is come out to fight with thee. And when he had heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
023	ISA	037	010	Thus shall ye say to Hezekiah the king of Judah, as followeth, Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given up into the hand of the king of Assyria.
023	ISA	037	011	Behold, thou thyself hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands by destroying them utterly: and thou alone shouldst be delivered?
023	ISA	037	012	Have the gods of the nations which my fathers destroyed delivered them, as Gozan, and Charan, and Rezeph, and the children of 'Eden, who were in Thelassar?
023	ISA	037	013	Where is the king of Chamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvayim, of Hena', and 'Ivvah?
023	ISA	037	014	And Hezekiah took the letter out of the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the Lord, and spread it out before the Lord.
023	ISA	037	015	And Hezekiah prayed unto the Lord, saying,
023	ISA	037	016	O Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, who dwellest between the cherubim, thou art the [true] God, thou alone, for all the kingdoms of the earth; [for] it is thou who hast made the heavens and earth.
023	ISA	037	017	Bend down, O Lord, thy ear, and hear; open, O Lord, thy eye, and see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which he hath sent to blaspheme the living God.
023	ISA	037	018	Truly, Lord, the kings of Assyria have devastated all the nations, and their land;
023	ISA	037	019	And they have placed their gods into the fire; for they are no gods, but the work of man's hands, wood and stone; and these have they destroyed.
023	ISA	037	020	And now, O Lord our God, save us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the Lord, thou alone.
023	ISA	037	021	Then sent Isaiah the son of Amoz unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus hath said the Lord the God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me concerning Sennacherib the king of Assyria:
023	ISA	037	022	This is the word that the Lord hath spoken over him: She despiseth thee, she laugheth thee to scorn, the virgin daughter of Zion; behind she shaketh her head, the daughter of Jerusalem.
023	ISA	037	023	Whom hast thou blasphemed, and [whom] hast thou scorned? and against whom hast thou raised thy voice, and lifted up thy eyes on high? against the Holy One of Israel.
023	ISA	037	024	Through thy servants hast thou blasphemed the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots am I indeed come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down its tall cedars, the choice of its fir-trees: and I will enter into the height of its summit, the forest of its fruitful soil.
023	ISA	037	025	I have dug, and drunk water; and I will dry up with the sole of my feet all the streams of besieged places.
023	ISA	037	026	Hadst thou not heard, that in distant ages I had prepared this? in the times of antiquity when I formed it? now have I brought it along, and it came to pass to desolate into ruinous heaps fortified cities.
023	ISA	037	027	And thus their inhabitants were of short power, they were discouraged and confounded: they were as the herbs of the field, and as the green grass; as the moss on the housetops, and as corn blasted before the ear appeareth.
023	ISA	037	028	But thy abiding, and thy going out, and thy coming in do I know, and thy raging against me.
023	ISA	037	029	Because of thy raging against me, and thy tumult, that is come up into my ears, will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle between thy lips, and I will cause thee to turn back on the way by which thou camest.
023	ISA	037	030	And this shall be unto thee the sign, Ye shall eat this year what groweth of itself, and in the second year what springeth after the same; and in the third year sow, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.
023	ISA	037	031	And the remnant of the house of Judah that is escaped shall yet strike root downward, and bear fruit upward.
023	ISA	037	032	For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and that which escapeth out of Mount Zion: the zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this.
023	ISA	037	033	Therefore thus hath said the Lord concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, and he shall not shoot an arrow thereon, nor come before it with shields, nor cast up an embankment against it.
023	ISA	037	034	On the way by which he came, by the same shall he return, and into this city shall he not come, saith the Lord.
023	ISA	037	035	And I will shield this city to save it for my own sake, and for the sake of David my servant.
023	ISA	037	036	Then went out an angel of the Lord, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians one hundred and eighty and five thousand men; and when people arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.
023	ISA	037	037	And Sennacherib the king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.
023	ISA	037	038	And it came to pass, as he was prostrating himself in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Essar-chaddon his son became king in his stead.
023	ISA	038	001	In those days Hezekiah fell sick unto death; and there came unto him Isaiah the son of Amoz, the prophet, and said unto him, Thus hath said the Lord, Give thy charge to thy house; for thou shalt die, and not live.
023	ISA	038	002	Then did Hezekiah turn his face to the wall, and prayed unto the Lord.
023	ISA	038	003	And he said, O Lord, I beseech thee remember now that I have walked before thee in truth, and with an undivided heart, and have done what is good in thy eyes. And Hezekiah wept aloud.
023	ISA	038	004	Then came the word of the Lord to Isaiah, saying,
023	ISA	038	005	Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus hath said the Lord, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years.
023	ISA	038	006	And out of the hand of the king of Assyria will I deliver thee and this city; and I will shield this city.
023	ISA	038	007	And this shall be unto thee the sign from the Lord, that the Lord will do this thing which he hath spoken:
023	ISA	038	008	Behold, I will cause the shadow of the degrees, which is gone down on the dial of Achaz by the sun, to return backward ten degrees. So the sun returned ten degrees, by the degrees which he was gone down.
023	ISA	038	009	The writing of Hezekiah the king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness:
023	ISA	038	010	I had said, In the midst of my days, must I enter the gates of the nether world; I am deprived of the residue of my years.
023	ISA	038	011	I had said, I shall not see the Lord, the Lord, in the land of the living: I shall not behold man any more among the inhabitants of the regions of death.
023	ISA	038	012	My dwelling is broken down, and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent: I have cut off, like a weaver, my life; with pining sickness will he snatch me away: from day until night wilt thou make an end of me.
023	ISA	038	013	I waited [with patience] till morning, [whether] as a lion, so would he break all my bones: from day until night wilt thou make an end of me.
023	ISA	038	014	Like a swallow or a crane, so did I chirp; I did moan like a dove; my eyes were lifted up on high: O Lord, I am oppressed; grant me ease.
023	ISA	038	015	What shall I speak? he hath promised it unto me, and he hath also accomplished it; I will make pilgrimages [to God's house] all my years because of the bitterness of my soul.
023	ISA	038	016	O Lord, by these [things men] will live, and in all these [things] is the life of my spirit: so wilt thou give me health, and cause me to live.
023	ISA	038	017	Behold, for peace I had great bitterness; but thou hast, in loving my soul, delivered it from the pit of corruption; for thou hast cast behind thy back all my sins.
023	ISA	038	018	For the nether world will not thank thee, death will not praise thee: they that go down into the pit will not hope for thy truth.
023	ISA	038	019	The living, the living alone shall thank thee, like me this day: the father to the children shall make known thy truth.
023	ISA	038	020	The Lord is there to help me; therefore we will play my hymns all the days of our life in the house of the Lord.
023	ISA	038	021	And Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it for a plaster upon the inflammation, and he shall recover.
023	ISA	038	022	And Hezekiah had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the Lord?
023	ISA	039	001	At that time sent Merodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, the king of Babylon, letters and a present to Hezekiah; for he had heard that he had been sick, and was become strong again.
023	ISA	039	002	And Hezekiah was rejoiced on their account, and showed them his treasure-house, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and the whole of his armor-house, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing that Hezekiah showed them not, in his house, and in all his dominion.
023	ISA	039	003	Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What did these men say? and whence did they come unto thee? And Hezekiah said, From a far-off country are they come unto me, from Babylon.
023	ISA	039	004	And he said, What did they see in thy house? And Hezekiah said, all that is in my house have they seen; there is nothing that I did not show them in my treasures.
023	ISA	039	005	And Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the Lord of hosts,
023	ISA	039	006	Behold, days are coming when all that is in thy house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the Lord.
023	ISA	039	007	And of thy sons that will issue from thee, whom thou wilt beget, shall they take; and they shall be court-servants in the palace of the king of Babylon.
023	ISA	039	008	Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of the Lord which thou hast spoken. He said moreover, For there shall be peace and stability in my days.
023	ISA	040	001	Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.
023	ISA	040	002	Speak ye [comfort] to the heart of Jerusalem, and call out unto her, that her time of sorrow is accomplished, that her iniquity is atoned for; for she hath received from the hand of the Lord double for all her sins.
023	ISA	040	003	A voice calleth out, In the wilderness make ye clear the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for God.
023	ISA	040	004	Every valley shall be raised, and every mountain and hill shall be made low; and the crooked shall be made a straight path, and the rough places a plain:
023	ISA	040	005	And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed; and all flesh shall see it together; for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.
023	ISA	040	006	A voice saith, Proclaim; and he saith, What shall I proclaim? all flesh is grass, and all its goodliness is as the flower of the field:
023	ISA	040	007	The grass withereth, the flower fadeth; because the breath of the Lord hath blown upon it; surely the people is grass.
023	ISA	040	008	The grass withereth, the flower fadeth; but the word of our God will stand firm for ever.
023	ISA	040	009	Upon a high mountain get thee up, thou that bringest good tidings to Zion; lift up with strength thy voice, thou who bringest good tidings to Jerusalem; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold, [here is] your God!
023	ISA	040	010	Behold, the Lord Eternal will come with might, and his arm ruleth for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.
023	ISA	040	011	Like a shepherd will he feed his flock: with his arm will he gather the lambs, and in his bosom will he carry them, will he lead gently those that suckle their young.
023	ISA	040	012	Who hath measured in the hollow of his hand the waters, and meted out the heavens with the span, and comprised in a measure the dust of the earth, and weighed in the scale-beam the mountains, and the hills in balances?
023	ISA	040	013	Who hath meted out the Spirit of the Lord? and [who was] his counsellor that he could have given him information?
023	ISA	040	014	With whom took he counsel, that he gave him understanding, and taught him the path of justice, and taught him knowledge, and caused him to know the way of understanding?
023	ISA	040	015	Behold, nations are as a drop out of a bucket, and as the small dust of the balance are they accounted: behold, isles are like the flying dust.
023	ISA	040	016	And Lebanon is not sufficient for burning, and its beasts do not suffice for burnt-offering.
023	ISA	040	017	All the nations are as naught before him; less than nothing, and vanity are they accounted to him.
023	ISA	040	018	To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him?
023	ISA	040	019	The graven image the artificer hath cast and the goldsmith hath overspread it with gold, and fabricated [on it] silver chains.
023	ISA	040	020	He that is skilled in the choice chooseth a wood that will not rot; he seeketh unto himself a skilful workman to prepare a graven image, that shall not be moved.
023	ISA	040	021	Know ye not? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not paid attention to the foundations of the earth?
023	ISA	040	022	[It is he] that dwelleth above the circle of the earth, while its inhabitants are as grasshoppers; that stretched out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in;
023	ISA	040	023	That bringeth princes to naught; rendering the judges of the earth as vanity.
023	ISA	040	024	Yes, they were not yet planted; yea, they were not yet sown; yea, their stem had not yet taken root in the earth: when he but breathed upon them, and they withered, and the storm-wind carrieth them away as stubble.
023	ISA	040	025	To whom then will ye liken me, that I should be equal to? saith the Holy One.
023	ISA	040	026	Lift up your eyes on high, and see who hath created these? he that bringeth out their host by number; that calleth them all by name; from the Mighty One not one escapeth.
023	ISA	040	027	Why wilt thou say, O Jacob, and speak, O Israel, My way is hidden from the Lord, and my cause hath passed from the cognizance of my God?
023	ISA	040	028	Dost thou not know? hast thou not heard? The God of everlasting is the Lord, is the Creator of the ends of the earth; he will not be faint and weary; unsearchable is his understanding.
023	ISA	040	029	He giveth to the faint strength; and to the powerless he imparteth much might.
023	ISA	040	030	Though youths should grow faint and be weary, and young men should utterly stumble:
023	ISA	040	031	Yet they that wait upon the Lord shall acquire new strength, they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk, and not become faint.
023	ISA	041	001	Keep silence before me, O islands; and let nations acquire new strength: let them approach, then let them speak, together let us come near to judgment.
023	ISA	041	002	Who waked up from the east the man whom righteousness met in his steps? he giveth up nations before him, and maketh him rule over kings; that his sword may render them as the dust, as driven stubble, his bow.
023	ISA	041	003	He pursueth them, passeth along in safety, by a path which his feet have not gone over before.
023	ISA	041	004	Who hath wrought and done it? he who called the generations from the beginning; I the Lord, [who am] the first, and with the latest I am the same.
023	ISA	041	005	The isles saw it, and are afraid; the ends of the earth tremble; they draw near, and come.
023	ISA	041	006	They help one another; and each one saith to his brother, Be strong!
023	ISA	041	007	So the smith encouraged the melter, he that smootheth with the hammer him that striketh on the anvil; saying of the solder, It is good; and he fastened it with nails, that it should not be moved.
023	ISA	041	008	But thou, Israel, art my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend;
023	ISA	041	009	Thou, whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the earth, and called thee from the midst of its chiefs, and said unto thee, Thou art my servant, I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away.
023	ISA	041	010	Fear thou not, for I am with thee; be not dismayed, for I am thy God; I strengthen thee, yea, I help thee, yea, I uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.
023	ISA	041	011	Behold, ashamed and confounded shall be all that were incensed against thee; they shall be as naught and perish—the men that strive with thee.
023	ISA	041	012	Thou wilt seek them, and shalt not find them, the men that contend with thee; they shall be as naught and as nothing, the men that make war against thee.
023	ISA	041	013	For I the Lord thy God lay hold of thy right hand; [I am he] who saith unto thee, Fear not, I help thee.
023	ISA	041	014	Fear not, thou worm Jacob, ye few men of Israel: I myself help thee, saith the Lord, and thy redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.
023	ISA	041	015	Behold, I have rendered thee a threshing instrument, sharp, new, having many teeth: thou shalt thresh mountains, and beat them small, and shalt render the hills as chaff.
023	ISA	041	016	Thou shalt scatter them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the storm shall disperse them; but thou shalt rejoice in the Lord, in the Holy One of Israel shalt thou glorify thyself.
023	ISA	041	017	The poor and the needy seek water, and there is none; their tongue is dried up with thirst: I the Lord will answer them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them.
023	ISA	041	018	I will open on naked mountain-peaks rivers, and in the midst of valleys fountains; I will change the wilderness into a pool of water, and the dry land into springs of water.
023	ISA	041	019	I will place in the wilderness the cedar, the acacia, and the myrtle, and the oil-tree; I will set in the desert the fir-tree, the pine and the box-tree together;
023	ISA	041	020	In order that they may see, and know and take [it to heart], and comprehend together, that the hand of the Lord hath done this, and the Holy One of Israel hath created it.
023	ISA	041	021	Produce your cause, saith the Lord: bring forward your strong reasons, saith the King of Jacob.
023	ISA	041	022	Let them bring them forward and tell us what shall happen: the former things—what are they?—tell us, that we may take it to heart, and know the result of them; or let us hear the things that are to come.
023	ISA	041	023	Tell the events that are to happen hereafter, that we may know that ye are gods: yea, do good, or do evil, that we may be astonished, and see it together.
023	ISA	041	024	Behold, ye are less than nothing, and your work less than a breath: [he that is] an abomination [alone] chooseth you.
023	ISA	041	025	I have waked up one from the north, and he cometh; from the rising of the sun one who will call on my name: and he shall [over-]come princes as mortar, and as the potter treadeth down the clay.
023	ISA	041	026	Who hath told it from the beginning, that we may know it? and aforetimes, that we may say, “it is right?” but indeed there is none that telleth, indeed there is none that letteth us hear, indeed there is none that heareth your words.
023	ISA	041	027	The first [was I to say] to Zion, Behold, there they are; and to Jerusalem will I give one that bringeth good tidings.
023	ISA	041	028	And I ever look, and there is no man; and among these there is no counsellor, that they could answer a word.
023	ISA	041	029	Behold, they all are naught; their works are nothing: wind and vanity are their molten images.
023	ISA	042	001	Behold my servant, whom I will uphold; my elect, in whom my soul delighteth: I have put my spirit upon him, that he may bring forth justice to the nations.
023	ISA	042	002	He shall not cry, nor call out aloud, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street.
023	ISA	042	003	A cracked reed will he not break, and a dimly burning wick will he not quench: unto truth shall he bring forth justice.
023	ISA	042	004	He shall not become fatigued and not be faint, till he have established justice on earth; and the isles shall wait for his law.
023	ISA	042	005	Thus hath said God the Lord, he that created the heavens, and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and the things which come out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to those that walk thereon:
023	ISA	042	006	I the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will lay hold on thy hand, and will keep thee, and appoint thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the nations;
023	ISA	042	007	To open blind eyes, to bring out from the dungeon the prisoner, and out of the prison-house those that dwell in darkness.
023	ISA	042	008	I am the Everlasting One, that is my name; and my glory will I not give to any other, nor my praise to graven images.
023	ISA	042	009	The former things, behold, are come to pass; and new things do I announce; before they spring forth I let you hear of them.
023	ISA	042	010	Sing unto the Lord a new song, his praise from the end of the earth; ye that go down to the sea, and all that filleth it; the isles, and their inhabitants.
023	ISA	042	011	Let resound with song the wilderness and its cities, the villages which Kedar inhabiteth: let the inhabitants of the rocks sing, let them shout forth from the top of the mountains.
023	ISA	042	012	Let them give glory unto the Lord, and in the islands declare his praise.
023	ISA	042	013	The Lord—as a mighty one will he go forth, like a man of war will he arouse his vengeance: he will shout, yea, raise the war-cry; against his enemies will he show his strength.
023	ISA	042	014	I have a long time held my peace; I have been still, and refrained myself: [now] like a travailing woman will I cry; I will destroy and devour [all] together.
023	ISA	042	015	I will lay waste mountains and hills, and all their herbs will I dry up; and I will change the rivers into islands, and pools will I dry up.
023	ISA	042	016	And I will cause the blind to walk on a way that they have not known; on paths that they have not known will I lead them: I will change darkness before them into light, and crooked places into plains. These are the things which I will do, and not leave them [unfulfilled].
023	ISA	042	017	They shall be turned back, they shall be ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to molten idols, Ye are our gods.
023	ISA	042	018	Ye deaf, hear; and ye blind, look up, that ye may see.
023	ISA	042	019	Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger whom I send? who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the servant of the Lord?
023	ISA	042	020	Thou seest many things, but observest not; the ears are open, but he heareth not.
023	ISA	042	021	The Lord willed [to do this] for the sake of his righteousness; [therefore] he magnifieth the law, and maketh it honorable.
023	ISA	042	022	But it is a people robbed and spoiled; they are all of them ensnared in holes, and in prison-houses are they hidden: they are become for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore.
023	ISA	042	023	Who among you will give ear to this? will hearken and listen, for the time to come?
023	ISA	042	024	Who gave up Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to plunderers? was it not the Lord? he it is against whom we have sinned; for they would not walk in his ways, neither did they hearken unto his law.
023	ISA	042	025	Therefore hath he poured out over him the fury of his anger, and the strength of battle: and it blazed all round about him, yet he regarded it not; and it burnt on him, yet he laid it not to heart.
023	ISA	043	001	But now thus hath said the Lord that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not; for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; mine art thou.
023	ISA	043	002	Whenever thou passest through the waters, I am with thee; and through the rivers, —they shall not overflow thee: whenever thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be scorched; neither shall the flame burn on thee.
023	ISA	043	003	For I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour; I have given Egypt for thy ransom, Cush and Seba in place of thee.
023	ISA	043	004	Since thou art precious in my eyes, art honorable, and I indeed do love thee: therefore will I give men in place of thee, and nations instead of thy soul.
023	ISA	043	005	Fear not, for I am with thee; from the east will I bring thy seed, and from the west will I gather thee.
023	ISA	043	006	I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Withhold not: bring my sons from afar, and my daughters from the ends of the earth;
023	ISA	043	007	Every one that is called by my name, and whom I have created for my glory; whom I have formed; yea, whom I have made.
023	ISA	043	008	Bring forward the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.
023	ISA	043	009	Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who among them can announce this? and cause us to hear former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say, It is truth.
023	ISA	043	010	Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, and my servant whom I have chosen: in order that ye may know and believe me, and understand, that I am he; before me there was no god formed, and after me there will be none.
023	ISA	043	011	I, I am the Lord; and beside me there is no saviour.
023	ISA	043	012	I myself have announced it, and I have saved, and I have let it be heard, and there was no strange [god] among you; and ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, and I am God.
023	ISA	043	013	Yea, from the [first] day am I he; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand: if I will work, is there one that can hinder it?
023	ISA	043	014	Thus hath said the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, For your sake did I send to Babylon, and in swift vessels brought I them all down, and the Chaldeans, in the ships of their joyful song.
023	ISA	043	015	I am the Lord, the Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King.
023	ISA	043	016	Thus hath said the Lord, who maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters;
023	ISA	043	017	Who bringeth forth chariot and horse, army and power: together shall they lie down, they shall not rise up again; they are extinct, like a wick are they quenched.
023	ISA	043	018	Remember not the former things, and ancient events regard no more.
023	ISA	043	019	Behold, I will do a new thing; now shall it spring forth; will ye not acknowledge it? I will even make in the wilderness a way, and in the desert rivers.
023	ISA	043	020	The beasts of the field shall honor me, the monsters and the ostriches; because I give waters in the wilderness, rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my elect;
023	ISA	043	021	This people which I have formed for myself; my praise shall they relate.
023	ISA	043	022	But on me hast thou not called, O Jacob; for thou art become weary of me, O Israel.
023	ISA	043	023	Thou hast not brought unto me the lamb of thy burnt-offerings; and with thy sacrifices hast thou not honored me: I have not troubled thee with meat-offerings, nor wearied thee with frankincense.
023	ISA	043	024	Thou hast not bought for me sweet cane, and with the fat of thy sacrifices hast thou not satisfied me; but thou hast troubled me with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thy iniquities.
023	ISA	043	025	I, it is I that blot out thy transgressions for my own sake, and thy sins I will not remember.
023	ISA	043	026	Put me in remembrance; let us plead together: relate thou, in order that thou mayest be justified.
023	ISA	043	027	Thy first father did sin, and they that plead for thee transgressed against me.
023	ISA	043	028	Therefore do I profane the holy princes, and I give up Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.
023	ISA	044	001	Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have chosen:
023	ISA	044	002	Thus hath said the Lord thy Maker, and he that formed thee from the womb, who will help thee, Fear not, O my servant Jacob; and thou Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.
023	ISA	044	003	For [as] I pour water upon the thirsty [land], and rain-droppings upon the dry ground: [so] will I pour my spirit over thy seed, and my blessing over thy offspring.
023	ISA	044	004	After they shall spring up [as] among grass, like willows by the water-courses.
023	ISA	044	005	This one will say, I belong to the Lord; and the other will call himself by the name of Jacob; and the other will inscribe himself with his hand unto the Lord, and surname himself by the name of Israel.
023	ISA	044	006	Thus hath said the Lord, the king of Israel, and his Redeemer, the Lord of hosts, I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no god.
023	ISA	044	007	And who, like me, will announce, and will tell it, and set it in order for me, since I appointed the people of ancient times? and the future things, and those which are to happen, —let them foretell unto them.
023	ISA	044	008	Have no dread, and do not despond; have I not long since informed thee, and have told it? and ye are my witnesses: Is there a god beside me? yea, there is no rock, whom I know not.
023	ISA	044	009	The makers of graven images are all vanity; and their costly idols cannot profit; and they are their own witnesses, that they see not and know not, in order that they may be ashamed.
023	ISA	044	010	Who hath formed a god, or cast an image that profiteth nothing?
023	ISA	044	011	Behold, all his associates shall be ashamed, for the workmen themselves are but men: let them all be gathered, let them stand up, they shall be terrified, they shall be ashamed together.
023	ISA	044	012	The iron-smith [maketh] an axe and worketh it in the coals, and with hammers he fashioneth it, and worketh it with his powerful arm; he also, when he is hungry, loseth his strength: when he drinketh no water, he becometh faint.
023	ISA	044	013	The worker in wood stretcheth out the rule; he marketh it out with chalk; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the compass, and maketh it after the figure of a man, after the beauty of a child of earth, that it may dwell in a house.
023	ISA	044	014	He felleth for himself cedars, and taketh cypress and oak, and he chooseth for himself the strongest among the trees of the forest; he planteth an ash, and the rain causeth it to grow.
023	ISA	044	015	Then doth it serve a man for burning; and he taketh thereof, and warmeth himself; he also heateth therewith, and baketh bread; he also worketh out a god, and boweth himself; he maketh of it an image, and kneeleth down thereto.
023	ISA	044	016	The half thereof hath he burnt in fire; with the half thereof will he eat flesh; he will roast food, and be satisfied; he will also warm himself, and say, Aha, I am warm, I have felt the fire:
023	ISA	044	017	And the residue thereof hath he made into a god, his graven image; he kneeleth down unto it, and boweth himself, and prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me; for my god art thou.
023	ISA	044	018	They know not, they understand not; for their eyes are daubed over, that they cannot see; their hearts, that they cannot understand.
023	ISA	044	019	And he layeth it not to heart, and hath no knowledge, no understanding, to say, The half thereof have I burnt in fire; and I have also baked upon its coals bread; I [now] will roast flesh, and eat it: and shall I make of its residue an abomination, before a block of wood shall I kneel?
023	ISA	044	020	He pursueth ashes; a deceived heart hath turned him aside; and he cannot deliver his soul, and will not say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?
023	ISA	044	021	Remember these things, O Jacob; and Israel, for thou art my servant: I have formed thee to be my servant, thou [art this]; O Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten by me.
023	ISA	044	022	I have blotted out, as a vapor, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee.
023	ISA	044	023	Sing, O ye heavens; for the Lord hath done it; shout, ye lowest depths of the earth; break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein; for the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and on Israel will he glorify himself.
023	ISA	044	024	Thus hath said the Lord, thy Redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb, I am the Lord that hath made all things; that hath stretched forth the heavens by myself alone; that hath spread abroad the earth from my own self;
023	ISA	044	025	That frustrate the tokens of the liars, and confuseth diviners; that turneth the wise backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish;
023	ISA	044	026	That fulfilleth the word of his servant, and performeth the counsel of his messengers; that saith of Jerusalem, It shall be inhabited; and of the cities of Judah, They shall be built, and their ruins will I raise up.
023	ISA	044	027	That saith to the deep, Be dry, and thy rivers will I dry up;
023	ISA	044	028	That saith of Cyrus, [He is] my shepherd, and all my pleasure shall he perform: even saying of Jerusalem, It shall be built; and the temple's foundation shall be laid.
023	ISA	045	001	Thus hath said the Lord to his anointed, to Cyrus, whom I have taken hold of by his right hand, to subdue nations before him, even the loins of kings will I ungird, to open before him [city-]doors, and gates that they shall not be shut;
023	ISA	045	002	I myself will go before thee, and proud eminences will I level: doors of brass will I break in pieces, and bolts of iron will I cut asunder.
023	ISA	045	003	And I will give unto thee the treasures of darkness, and riches hidden in secret places; in order that thou mayest know that I am the Lord, who call thee by thy name, the God of Israel;
023	ISA	045	004	For the sake of my servant Jacob, and Israel my elect; and I have called thee by thy name: I have designated thee, though thou hast not known me.
023	ISA	045	005	I am the Lord, and there is none else, beside me there is no god; I assisted thee, though thou hast not known me.
023	ISA	045	006	In order that they may know from the rising of the sun, and from its setting, that there is nothing without me. I am the Lord, and there is no one else;
023	ISA	045	007	Forming the light, and creating darkness; making peace, and creating evil: I the Lord do all these things.
023	ISA	045	008	Drop down ye heavens, and let the skies distil blessing; let the earth open and let them [all] be fruitful of prosperity, and let righteousness spring up likewise: I the Lord have created it.
023	ISA	045	009	Woe unto him that contendeth with the one who formed him—a potsherd among the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands?
023	ISA	045	010	Woe unto him that saith unto [his] father, What begettest thou? or to the woman, What bringest thou forth?
023	ISA	045	011	Thus hath said the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, and he who hath formed him, About events to come will you ask me? concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands will ye command me?
023	ISA	045	012	[When] I myself have made the earth, and created man upon it; [when] I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and I have ordained all their host.
023	ISA	045	013	I myself have waked him up in righteousness, and all his ways will I make straight: he shall build my city, and my exiles shall he dismiss free, not for purchase-money nor for presents, saith the Lord of hosts.
023	ISA	045	014	Thus hath said the Lord, The labor of Egypt, and the merchandise of Ethiopia, and of the Sabeans, men of high stature, shall pass over unto thee, and thine shall they be: behind thee shall they walk; in chains shall they pass along, and unto thee shall they bow, unto thee shall they pray, [saying] Yea, only among thee is God; and there is no one else beside God.
023	ISA	045	015	Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour.
023	ISA	045	016	They are ashamed, and also confounded, all of them: together shall they go to confusion that are makers of idols.
023	ISA	045	017	[But] Israel shall be helped by the Lord with an everlasting salvation: ye shall not be ashamed and not be confounded unto all eternity.
023	ISA	045	018	For thus hath said the Lord the creator of the heavens; he, the God that formed the earth and made it; he that hath established it, —not for naught did he create it, to be inhabited did he form it: I am the Lord; and there is no one else.
023	ISA	045	019	Not on a secret spot have I spoken, in a dark place of the earth; I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me for naught; [but] I the Lord speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.
023	ISA	045	020	Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye escaped fugitives of the nations! They have no knowledge that carry the wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot save.
023	ISA	045	021	Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel together: Who hath announced this in ancient times? told it from the beginning? is it not I the Lord? and there is no other god without me, a just god and a saviour; there is none beside me.
023	ISA	045	022	Turn unto me, so that ye may be helped, all ye ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is no one else.
023	ISA	045	023	By myself have I sworn, righteousness is gone out of my mouth, a word [which] shall not return, That unto me every knee shall bend, every tongue shall swear.
023	ISA	045	024	Only in the Lord, —shall men say of me, —there are righteousness and strength. Unto him shall come and be ashamed all that are incensed against him.
023	ISA	045	025	In the Lord shall be justified, and shall glory themselves all the seed of Israel.
023	ISA	046	001	Bel is bowed down, Nebo sinketh, their idols are [delivered] unto the beasts, and unto the cattle; those which were once carried by you are now laden up a burden to the weary beasts.
023	ISA	046	002	They are sunk, they are bowed down together; they could not deliver the burden, but they themselves are gone into captivity.
023	ISA	046	003	Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, who are borne [by me] from their birth, who are carried from the womb;
023	ISA	046	004	And even unto old age I am the same; and even unto the time of hoary hairs will I bear: l have done it, and I will carry [you]; even I will bear, and deliver you.
023	ISA	046	005	To whom will ye liken and assimilate me, and compare me, that we may be like?
023	ISA	046	006	[There are those] that lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance; that hire a melter, that he may make of it a god; they [then] bend the knee, yea, they bow themselves down;
023	ISA	046	007	They carry him, upon the shoulder they bear him, and set up him in his spot, and he remaineth standing, from his place he doth not move: yea, though one should cry unto him, he cannot answer, out of his trouble he cannot help him.
023	ISA	046	008	Remember this, and take courage: take it again to heart, O ye transgressors.
023	ISA	046	009	Remember the former things of olden times; for I am God, and there is no one else; I am God, and there is nothing like me.
023	ISA	046	010	Declaring from the beginning the end, and from the earliest days the things that have not yet been done, saying, My counsel shall stand firm, and all my pleasure will I do:
023	ISA	046	011	Calling from the east the eagle, from a far-off country the man of my counsel; yea, I have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also execute it.
023	ISA	046	012	Hearken unto me, ye stout of heart, that are far from righteousness:
023	ISA	046	013	I have brought near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not tarry: and I will grant unto Zion salvation, unto Israel my glory.
023	ISA	047	001	Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon; sit on the ground, there is no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans; for men shall nevermore call thee, Tender and delicate.
023	ISA	047	002	Take the mill, and grind meal: uncover thy locks, lift up the train, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers.
023	ISA	047	003	Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and I will not regard any man.
023	ISA	047	004	Our redeemer—the Lord of hosts is his name, the Holy One of Israel.
023	ISA	047	005	Sit thou silent, and enter into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans; for men shall never more call thee, The mistress of kingdoms.
023	ISA	047	006	I was wroth over my people, I defiled my inheritance, and gave them into thy hand: [yet] thou didst grant them no mercy; upon the aged hast thou laid very heavily thy yoke.
023	ISA	047	007	And thou saidst, For ever shall I be mistress; until that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart, thou didst not call to mind the result thereof.
023	ISA	047	008	And now hear this, luxurious one, that dwellest in security, that sayest in thy heart, I am, and there is nothing else beside me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children:
023	ISA	047	009	Yet both these things shall come to thee in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood; in their full measure shall they come upon thee, despite of the multitude of thy sorceries, despite of the very great abundance of thy enchantments.
023	ISA	047	010	And thou didst trust in thy wickedness: thou saidst, No one seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, —these were they that seduced thee; and thou saidst in thy heart, I am, and there is nothing else beside me.
023	ISA	047	011	And there shall come upon thee an evil, which thou shalt not know how to remove it by prayer; and there shall fall upon thee mischief, which thou shalt not be able to atone for; and there shall come upon thee suddenly desolation, which thou shalt not know.
023	ISA	047	012	Stand now with thy enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast labored from thy youth; peradventure thou mayest be able to profit, peradventure thou mayest withstand.
023	ISA	047	013	Thou art wearied with the multitude of thy counsels. Do let now those that divide off the heavens, that look at the stars, that announce [coming] events at new moons, stand up, and save thee from the things that are to come over thee.
023	ISA	047	014	Behold, they are become as stubble; the fire burneth them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: not a coal shall be left to warm at, no blaze to sit before it.
023	ISA	047	015	Thus are they become unto thee with whom thou hast labored; those that had commerce with thee from thy youth, wander away every one on his road: there is no one to save thee.
023	ISA	048	001	Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the spring of Judah, who swear by the name of the Lord, and make mention of the God of Israel, —not in truth, nor in righteousness.
023	ISA	048	002	For of the holy city they call themselves, and upon the God of Israel they stay themselves, —The Lord of hosts is his name.
023	ISA	048	003	The former things have I declared from the beginning; and out of my mouth went they forth, and I announced them: suddenly did I accomplish them, and they came to pass;
023	ISA	048	004	Because I knew that thou art obstinate, that like an iron sinew is thy neck, and thy brow of copper;
023	ISA	048	005	And I declared it to thee from the beginning; before yet it came to pass did I let thee hear it: lest thou should say, My idol hath done these things, and my graven image, and my molten image, have ordained them.
023	ISA	048	006	Thou hast heard it; see it all now; and you—will you not declare it? I caused thee to hear new things, from this time, even hidden things which thou hadst not known.
023	ISA	048	007	Now are they created, and not from the beginning; and before the day [that I announced them] thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them.
023	ISA	048	008	But neither hadst thou heard it; nor didst thou know; nor had in ancient times thy ear been opened; for I knew that thou wouldst deal very treacherously, and a transgressor wast thou called from thy birth.
023	ISA	048	009	For the sake of my name will I defer my anger, and because of my praise will I restrain it toward thee, so that I may not cut thee off.
023	ISA	048	010	Behold, I have refined thee, though not into silver: I have approved thee in the crucible of affliction.
023	ISA	048	011	For my own sake will I do it: for how would [my name] be dishonored? and my glory will I not give unto another.
023	ISA	048	012	Hearken unto me, O Jacob, and Israel, my called one; I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.
023	ISA	048	013	My hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spanned out the heavens: I call unto them, they stand forward together.
023	ISA	048	014	Assemble yourselves, all of you, and hear: Who among them hath told these things? He whom the Lord loveth, will do his pleasure on Babylon, and [display] his arm [on] the Chaldeans.
023	ISA	048	015	I, even I, have spoken it, I have also called him: I have brought him, and he shall be prosperous on his way.
023	ISA	048	016	Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; never from the beginning have I spoken in secret; from the time that it occurred, was I there. And now the Lord Eternal hath sent me, and his Spirit.
023	ISA	048	017	Thus hath said the Lord, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, I am the Lord thy God who teach thee for thy profit, who lead thee by the way thou shouldst go.
023	ISA	048	018	Oh that thou hadst but listened to my commandments! then would have been as a river thy peace, and thy prosperity as the waves of the sea:
023	ISA	048	019	And then would have been as the sand thy seed, and the offspring of thy body like the pebbles of the sea-shore; yet shall his name not be cut off nor destroyed from before me.
023	ISA	048	020	Go forth out of Babylon, flee away from the Chaldeans, with the voice of singing declare, announce this, carry it forth as far as the end of the earth; say, The Lord hath redeemed his servant Jacob.
023	ISA	048	021	And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts; waters out of the rock he let drop down for them: and he cleaved the rock, and the waters gushed out.
023	ISA	048	022	There is no peace, saith the Lord, unto the wicked.
023	ISA	049	001	Hearken, O isles, unto me; and listen, ye people, from afar: The Lord hath called me from my birth; from my mother's womb hath he made mention of my name.
023	ISA	049	002	And he hath rendered my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand hath he hidden me: and he hath rendered me as a polished arrow; in his quiver hath he concealed me;
023	ISA	049	003	And said unto me, My servant art thou, O Israel, thou on whom I will be glorified.
023	ISA	049	004	But I had indeed said, For no purpose have I labored, for naught and vanity have I spent my strength; yet surely my cause is with the Lord, and the recompense of my work with my God.
023	ISA	049	005	And now hath said the Lord that formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, that Israel may be gathered unto him, that I should be honored in the eyes of the Lord, while my God was my strength, —
023	ISA	049	006	And he said, It is too light a thing that thou shouldst be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to bring back the preserved of Israel! but I will [also] appoint thee for a light to the nations, that my salvation may reach as far as the end of the earth.
023	ISA	049	007	Thus hath said the Lord, the Redeemer of Israel, his Holy One, to him who is despised by men, to him who is abhorred by nations, to the servant of rulers, Kings shall see it and rise up, princes, and they shall prostrate themselves, for the sake of the Lord, who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel, who hath made choice of thee.
023	ISA	049	008	Thus hath said the Lord, In the time of favor have I answered thee, and on the day of salvation have I helped thee; and I will preserve thee, and I will appoint thee as a people of my covenant to raise up the land, to divide out desolate heritages;
023	ISA	049	009	When I say to the prisoners, Go forth; to those that are in darkness, Show yourselves. On the roads shall they feed, and on all mountain-peaks shall be their pasture.
023	ISA	049	010	They shall not be hungry nor thirsty, and neither heat nor sun shall smite them; for he that hath mercy on them will lead them, and by springs of water will he guide them.
023	ISA	049	011	And I will change all my mountains into a road, and my highways shall be lifted up.
023	ISA	049	012	Behold, these shall come from afar; and, lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.
023	ISA	049	013	Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth, O mountains, into song; for the Lord hath comforted his people, and upon his oppressed will he have mercy.
023	ISA	049	014	Yet Zion said, the Eternal hath forsaken me, and the Lord hath forgotten me.
023	ISA	049	015	Can a woman forget her sucking child, not to have mercy on the son of her body? yea, should these even forget, yet would I not forget thee.
023	ISA	049	016	Behold, upon the palms of my hands have I engraved thee; thy walls are continually before me.
023	ISA	049	017	Thy children come in haste; thy destroyers and they that laid thee waste shall go away from thee.
023	ISA	049	018	Lift up thy eyes round about, and see; they all are assembled together, they come to thee: as I live, saith the Lord, thou shalt surely clothe thyself with them all, as with an ornament, and bind them on thee, as a bride.
023	ISA	049	019	For thy ruins and thy desolate places, and thy wasted land, —yea, now shall it be too narrow for thee by reason of the inhabitants, and thy destroyers shall be far away.
023	ISA	049	020	Yet again will say before thy ears the children of whom thou wast deprived, The place is too narrow for me; make room for me that I may dwell.
023	ISA	049	021	And thou wilt say in thy heart, Who hath born me these, seeing I was bereft of my children, and was solitary, an exile, and outcast? and who hath brought up these? Behold, I was left entirely alone; these, where have they been?
023	ISA	049	022	Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will lift up to the nations my hand, and to the people will I raise up high my standard; and they shall bring thy sons in [their] arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon shoulders.
023	ISA	049	023	And kings shall be thy nursing-fathers, and their princesses thy nursing-mothers; with the face toward the earth shall they bow down to thee, and the dust of thy feet shall they lick up: and thou shalt know that I am the Lord, who will not suffer those who hope in me to be ashamed.
023	ISA	049	024	Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or shall the captive of the victor escape?
023	ISA	049	025	For thus hath said the Lord, Also the captive of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the powerful shall escape; and with those who contend against thee will I contend, and thy children will I indeed save.
023	ISA	049	026	And I will feed thy oppressors with their own flesh; and as with new wine shall they be made drunken with their own blood: and all flesh shall know that I the Eternal am thy Saviour, and thy Redeemer the Mighty One of Jacob.
023	ISA	050	001	Thus hath said the Lord, Where is your mother's bill of divorcement, wherewith I have sent her away? or who of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you? behold, for your iniquities were ye sold, and for your transgressions was your mother sent away.
023	ISA	050	002	Why did I come and no man was there, did I call, with none to answer? hath my hand become too short for redeeming? or is there no power in me to deliver? behold, through my threatening I can dry up the sea, I can change the rivers into a wilderness: their fish stink for want of water, and die for thirst.
023	ISA	050	003	I can clothe the heavens with blackness, and I can make sackcloth their garment.
023	ISA	050	004	The Lord Eternal hath given me a tongue for teaching, that I should know how to strengthen the weary with the word: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth my ear to listen like those who are well taught.
023	ISA	050	005	The Lord Eternal hath opened me my ear, and I resisted not: I turned not backward.
023	ISA	050	006	My back I gave up to the smiters, and my cheeks to those that plucked off the hair: my face I hid not from abuse and spitting.
023	ISA	050	007	But the Lord Eternal ever helpeth me; therefore was I not confounded; therefore have I rendered my face like a flint, and I knew that I should not be made ashamed.
023	ISA	050	008	He that justifieth me is near; who will contend with me? let us stand forward together: who hath a dispute with me? let him come near to me.
023	ISA	050	009	Behold, the Lord Eternal will help me; who is the man that will condemn me? lo, they all shall wear out as a garment: the moth shall eat them up.
023	ISA	050	010	Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that hearkeneth to the voice of his servant? though he have walked in darkness, and had no light: let him trust in the name of the Lord, and lean for support upon his God.
023	ISA	050	011	Behold, all ye that kindle fire, that urge on the brands: walk by the blaze of your fire, and by the brands ye have kindled; from my hand hath this been bestowed on you; in pain shall ye lie down.
023	ISA	051	001	Hearken to me, ye that pursue righteousness, that seek the Lord: look unto the rock whence ye were hewn, and to the hole of the pit whence ye were dug up.
023	ISA	051	002	Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bore you; for he was one when I called him, and I blessed him, and I increased him.
023	ISA	051	003	Yea, the Lord hath comforted Zion; he hath comforted all her ruins; and he hath made her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the Lord: gladness and joy shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of song.
023	ISA	051	004	Listen unto me, my people; and O my nation, give ear unto me; for a law shall proceed from me, and my justice will I establish as a light of the people.
023	ISA	051	005	My righteousness is near; my salvation goeth forth, and my arms shall judge the people: on me the isles shall wait, and for my arm shall they hope.
023	ISA	051	006	Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath; for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wear out like a garment, and they that dwell thereon shall die in like manner; but my salvation shall exist for ever, and my righteousness shall not be delayed.
023	ISA	051	007	Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, O people in whose heart my law is: ye must not fear the reproach of men, and of their revilings shall ye not be in dread.
023	ISA	051	008	For like a garment shall the moth eat them up, and like wool shall the worm eat them; but my righteousness shall exist for ever, and my salvation from generation to generation.
023	ISA	051	009	Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the Lord: awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of olden times. Art thou not it that struck down Rahab, that pierced the crocodile?
023	ISA	051	010	Art thou not it that dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep; that rendered the depths of the sea a road for the redeemed to pass through?
023	ISA	051	011	And [so] shall the ransomed of the Lord return, and come to Zion with song, with everlasting joy upon their head; gladness and joy shall they obtain, while sorrow and sighing shall have fled away.
023	ISA	051	012	I, I am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou shouldst be afraid of a mortal that must die, and of a son of man who will wither as the grass?
023	ISA	051	013	And thou forgettest the Lord, thy Maker, who hath spread out the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and thou dreadest continually, all the day, because of the fury of the oppressor, whenever he aimeth to destroy: and where is [now] the fury of the oppressor?
023	ISA	051	014	The exile will be speedily set free; and he shall not die in the dungeon, and his bread shall not fail.
023	ISA	051	015	For I am the Lord thy God, who stirreth up the sea that its waves roar: the Lord of hosts is his name.
023	ISA	051	016	And I have placed my words in thy mouth, and with the shadow of my hand have I covered thee: to plant the heavens, and to lay the foundations of the earth, and to say to Zion, Thou art my people.
023	ISA	051	017	Rouse up, rouse up, arise, O Jerusalem, thou who hast drunk from the hand of the Lord the cup of his fury: the deep cup of confusion hast thou drunk, hast thou drained.
023	ISA	051	018	There is none to lead her, from all the children whom she hath born; and there is none that taketh her by the hand, from all the children whom she hath brought up.
023	ISA	051	019	Two things are these which have befallen thee: who will have compassion for thee? desolation and destruction, and famine and sword—with whom shall I comfort thee?
023	ISA	051	020	Thy children have fainted, they lie at the entrance of all streets, as a wild bull caught in a net, [they are those] who are full of the fury of the Lord, the threatening of thy God.
023	ISA	051	021	Therefore hear now this, O thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine.
023	ISA	051	022	Thus hath said thy Lord, the Eternal, and thy God, who will ever plead for his people, Behold, I have taken out of thy hand the cup of confusion, the deep cup of my fury: thou shalt never more drink it again.
023	ISA	051	023	And I will place it in the hand of those who have tortured thee, that have said to thy soul, Bend thee down, that we may pass over; and thou madest like the earth thy back, and like the street for those that passed over.
023	ISA	052	001	Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, thou holy city; for no more shall enter into thee henceforth the uncircumcised and the unclean.
023	ISA	052	002	Shake thyself free from the dust, arise, sit down, O Jerusalem: loosen thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive, daughter of Zion.
023	ISA	052	003	For thus hath said the Lord, For naught were you sold, and without silver shall ye be redeemed.
023	ISA	052	004	For thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Into Egypt went my people down aforetimes, to sojourn there, and Asshur hath oppressed it without cause.
023	ISA	052	005	And now what have I here, saith the Lord, since my people hath been taken away for naught? its rulers vaunt aloud, saith the Lord, and continually, all the day, is my name blasphemed.
023	ISA	052	006	Therefore shall my people know my name, therefore on that day, that I am he that speaketh it: here am I.
023	ISA	052	007	How beautiful are upon the mountains the feet of the messenger of good tidings, that publisheth peace, that announceth tidings of happiness, that publisheth salvation, that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth.
023	ISA	052	008	The voice of thy watchmen, —they raise their voice, together shall they shout; for eye to eye shall they see, when the Lord returneth unto Zion.
023	ISA	052	009	Break forth [in song], shout together, ye ruins of Jerusalem; the Lord hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem.
023	ISA	052	010	The Lord hath made bare his holy arm before the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.
023	ISA	052	011	Depart ye, depart ye, go out from there, touch no unclean thing; go ye out from the midst of it; cleanse yourselves, ye bearers of the vessels of the Lord.
023	ISA	052	012	Not in haste shall ye go out, and not in flight shall ye go; for before you goeth the Lord, and your rereward is the God of Israel.
023	ISA	052	013	Behold, my servant shall be prosperous, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be placed very high.
023	ISA	052	014	Just as many were astonished at thee, so greatly was his countenance marred more than any [other] man's, and his form more than [that of] the sons of men, —
023	ISA	052	015	Thus will he cause many nations to jump up in [astonishment]; at him will kings shut their mouth; for what had not been told unto them shall they see, and what they had never heard shall they understand.
023	ISA	053	001	Who would have believed our report? and the arm of the Lord—over whom hath it been revealed?
023	ISA	053	002	Yea, he grew up like a small shoot before him, and as a root out of a dry land: he had no form nor comeliness, so that we should look at him; and no countenance, so that we should desire him.
023	ISA	053	003	He was despised and shunned by men; a man of pains, and acquainted with disease; and as one who hid his face from us was he despised, and we esteemed him not.
023	ISA	053	004	But only our diseases did he bear himself, and our pains he carried: while we indeed esteemed him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.
023	ISA	053	005	Yet he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement for our peace was upon him; and through his bruises was healing granted to us.
023	ISA	053	006	We all like sheep went astray; every one to his own way did we turn; and the Lord let befall him the guilt of us all.
023	ISA	053	007	He was oppressed, and he was also taunted, yet he opened not his mouth; like the lamb which is led to the slaughter, and like an ewe before her shearers is dumb; and he opened not his mouth.
023	ISA	053	008	Through oppression and through judicial punishment was he taken away; but his generation—who could tell, that he was cut away out of the land of life, [that] for the transgressions of my people the plague was laid on him?
023	ISA	053	009	And he let his grave be made with the wicked, and with the [godless] rich at his death; although he had done no violence, and there was no deceit in his mouth.
023	ISA	053	010	But the Lord was pleased to crush him through disease: when [now] his soul hath brought the trespass-offering, then shall he see [his] seed, live many days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand.
023	ISA	053	011	[Freed] from the trouble of his soul shall he see [the good] and be satisfied: through his knowledge shall my righteous servant bring the many to righteousness, while he will bear their iniquities.
023	ISA	053	012	Therefore will I divide him [a portion] with the many, and with the strong shall he divide the spoil; because he poured out his soul unto death, and with transgressors was he numbered: while he bore the sin of many, and for the transgressors he let [evil] befall him.
023	ISA	054	001	Sing, O barren one, that thou hast not born: break forth into song, and rejoice aloud, that thou hast not travailed; for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith the Lord.
023	ISA	054	002	Enlarge the space of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thy habitations, —spare not: lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes;
023	ISA	054	003	For to the right and to the left shalt thou spread forth; and thy seed shall drive out nations, desolate cities shall they repeople.
023	ISA	054	004	Fear not, for thou shalt not be made ashamed; and be not confounded, for thou shalt not be put to the blush; for the shame of thy youth shalt thou forget, and the reproach of thy widowhood shalt thou not remember any more.
023	ISA	054	005	For thy husband is thy Maker, the Lord of hosts is his name; and thy Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel, “The God of all the earth,” shall he be called.
023	ISA	054	006	For as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit did the Lord call thee back, and as a wife of youth, that was rejected, saith thy God.
023	ISA	054	007	But for a brief moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I again receive thee.
023	ISA	054	008	In a little wrath did I hide my face for a moment from thee; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith thy Redeemer the Lord.
023	ISA	054	009	For as the waters of Noah is this unto me; as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more pass over the earth: so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.
023	ISA	054	010	For the mountains may depart, and the hills may be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith he that hath mercy on thee, the Lord.
023	ISA	054	011	O thou afflicted, tossed by the tempest, and not comforted, behold, I will lay thy stones with fair colors, and lay thy foundations with sapphires.
023	ISA	054	012	And I will make of rubies thy battlements, and thy gates into carbuncle-stones, and all thy borders into precious stones.
023	ISA	054	013	And all thy children shall be disciples of the Lord; and great shall be the peace of thy children.
023	ISA	054	014	In righteousness shalt thou be established: keep far from oppression, for thou shalt not fear; and from terror, for it shall not come near unto thee.
023	ISA	054	015	Behold, they that assemble together, are nothing without me: whatsoever assembleth together against thee shall fall under thy power.
023	ISA	054	016	Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have also created the waster to destroy.
023	ISA	054	017	No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that will rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their due reward from me, saith the Lord.
023	ISA	055	001	Ho, every one of ye that thirsteth, come ye to the water, and he too that hath no money: come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy without money and without price wine and milk.
023	ISA	055	002	Wherefore will ye spend money for what is not bread? and your labor for what satisfieth not? hearken then unto me, and eat what is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.
023	ISA	055	003	Incline your ear, and come unto me, hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make with you an everlasting covenant, the promised mercies of David, which are sure.
023	ISA	055	004	Behold, for a lawgiver unto the people have I appointed him, a prince and commander to the people.
023	ISA	055	005	Behold, a nation thou knowest not shalt thou call, and a nation that knew thee not shall run unto thee; for the sake of the Lord thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel, for he hath glorified thee.
023	ISA	055	006	Seek ye the Lord, while he may be found, call ye on him, while he is near.
023	ISA	055	007	Let the wicked forsake his way, and the man of unrighteousness his thoughts; and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and unto our God, for he will abundantly pardon.
023	ISA	055	008	For not my thoughts are your thoughts, and not your ways are my ways, saith the Lord.
023	ISA	055	009	For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so high are my ways above your ways, and my thoughts above your thoughts.
023	ISA	055	010	For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and return not thither, but water the earth, and render it fruitful, and cause it to bring forth plants; and give seed to the sower and bread to him that eateth:
023	ISA	055	011	So shall ever be my word which goeth forth from my mouth, it shall not return unto me without effect; but it accomplisheth what I desire, and it prospereth in that whereto I have sent it.
023	ISA	055	012	For in joy shall ye go out, and in peace shall ye be brought home: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into song, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.
023	ISA	055	013	Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir-tree, and instead of the nettle shall come up the myrtle; and it shall be unto the Lord for a name, for a sign of everlasting that shall not be cut off.
023	ISA	056	001	Thus hath said the Lord, Keep ye justice, and do equity; for near is my salvation to come, and my righteousness to be revealed.
023	ISA	056	002	Happy is the mortal that ever doth this, and the son of man that ever layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath by not violating it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.
023	ISA	056	003	And let not say the son of the stranger, that joineth himself unto the Lord, saying, Surely the Lord will exclude me from his people; nor let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.
023	ISA	056	004	For thus hath said the Lord concerning the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and make choice of what pleaseth me, and take hold of my covenant.
023	ISA	056	005	I will indeed give unto them in my house and within my walls a place and a name, better than sons and daughters: an everlasting name will I give them, that shall not be cut off.
023	ISA	056	006	Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves unto the Lord, to serve him, and to love the name of the Lord, to be unto him as servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath by not violating it, and those who take hold of my covenant:
023	ISA	056	007	Even these will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer; their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon my altar; for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations.
023	ISA	056	008	Thus saith the Lord Eternal who gathereth the outcasts of Israel, I will yet gather [others] to him, beside his own gathered [outcasts].
023	ISA	056	009	All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, [yea,] all ye beasts in the forest.
023	ISA	056	010	His watchmen are all of them blind, they know nothing; they all are dumb dogs, they cannot bark; dreamers, lying down, loving to slumber.
023	ISA	056	011	But the dogs are of a greedy disposition, they know not how to be satisfied; and those are shepherds that know how to understand: they all turn to their own way, every one after his gain, from all quarters.
023	ISA	056	012	Come ye, I will fetch wine, and let us swallow abundantly of strong drink; and like this day shall it be tomorrow, excellent and in very great abundance.
023	ISA	057	001	The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart: and pious men are taken away, without one considering that before the evil the righteous is taken away.
023	ISA	057	002	He shall come [to his fathers] in peace: they shall repose in their resting-place, every one that walketh in his uprightness.
023	ISA	057	003	But ye draw near hither, sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the harlot.
023	ISA	057	004	Over whom will you make yourselves merry? concerning whom will you open wide your mouth, stretch out your tongue? are ye not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood,
023	ISA	057	005	That are inflamed after the idols under every green tree; that slaughter the children in the valleys under the clefts of the rocks?
023	ISA	057	006	Of the smooth stones of the valley is thy portion; they, they are thy lot: even to them hast thou poured out a drink-offering, hast thou offered a meat-offering. Shall I for these things repent me [of the evil]?
023	ISA	057	007	Upon a high and lofty mountain hast thou placed thy couch: even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice.
023	ISA	057	008	And behind the doors and the door-posts hast thou placed thy [mark of] remembrance; for [departing] from me, thou hast laid open, and art gone up, —hast enlarged thy couch, and made thee a covenant with some of them; thou hast loved their lying with thee, hast selected a fitting place.
023	ISA	057	009	And thou didst show thyself unto the king without ointment, and thou didst multiply thy perfumes, and thou didst send out thy messengers even into the far-off distance, and didst debase thyself even down to the nether world.
023	ISA	057	010	Though thou art wearied by the length of thy way, yet saidst thou not, It is useless: thou hadst found enough for thy hand; therefore didst thou feel no care.
023	ISA	057	011	And of whom hadst thou dread or fear, that thou becamest false, and didst not remember me, nor lay it to thy heart? is it not so? I kept silence, and this from earliest times, and therefore thou fearest me not!
023	ISA	057	012	I, I ever tell thee [what deeds would be] thy righteousness; but thy works—these indeed will not profit thee.
023	ISA	057	013	When thou criest, let thy masses of idols deliver thee; but all of them will the wind carry away, a breath will take them off; but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain.
023	ISA	057	014	And he will say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, clear out the way, lift up every stumbling block out of the way of my people.
023	ISA	057	015	For thus hath said the high and lofty One, who inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy, In the high and holy place do I dwell, yet also with the contrite and humble of spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite.
023	ISA	057	016	For not to eternity will I contend, neither will I be for ever wroth: when the spirit from before me is overwhelmed, and the souls which I have made.
023	ISA	057	017	Because of the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and I smote him, hiding my face, and was wroth: while he went on frowardly in the way of his own heart.
023	ISA	057	018	I [now] see his ways, and I will heal him; and I will guide him, and bestow full comforts on him and on his mourners;
023	ISA	057	019	Creating the fruit of the lips: Peace, peace to him that is afar off, and to him that is near, saith the Lord; and I will heal him.
023	ISA	057	020	But the wicked are like the troubled sea; for it can never be at rest, but its waters cast up mire and dirt.
023	ISA	057	021	There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.
023	ISA	058	001	Cry with a full throat, spare not, like the cornet lift up thy voice, and declare unto my people their transgression, and to the house of Jacob their sins.
023	ISA	058	002	Yet me do they ever seek day by day, and to know my ways do they always desire; as a nation that hath done righteousness, and hath not forsaken the ordinance of their God: continually do they ask of me the ordinances of justice—do they desire to draw nigh unto God.
023	ISA	058	003	“Wherefore have we fasted, and thou seest it not? have we afflicted our soul, and thou regardest it not?” Behold, on the day of your fasting ye follow your business, and all your acquired gains do ye exact.
023	ISA	058	004	Behold, for contention and strife do ye fast, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye fast not so at this day, to cause your voice to be heard on high.
023	ISA	058	005	Is such then the fast which I can choose? a day that a man afflicteth his soul? to bend his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes for his couch? wilt thou call this a fast, and a day of acceptability unto the Lord?
023	ISA	058	006	Is not this [rather] the fast that I will choose? to open the snares of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye should break asunder every yoke?
023	ISA	058	007	Is it not to distribute thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the afflicted poor into thy house! when thou seest the naked, that thou clothe him; and that thou hide not thyself from thy own flesh?
023	ISA	058	008	Then shall break forth as the morning-dawn thy light, and thy healing shall speedily spring forth; and before thee shall go thy righteousness, the glory of the Lord shall be thy rereward.
023	ISA	058	009	Then shalt thou call, and the Lord will answer; thou shalt cry, and he will say, Here am I. If thou remove from the midst of thee the yoke, the stretching out of the finger, and speaking wickedly;
023	ISA	058	010	And if thou pour out to the hungry thy soul, and satisfy the afflicted soul: then shall shine forth in the darkness thy light, and thy obscurity be as the noonday;
023	ISA	058	011	And the Lord will guide thee continually, and will satisfy thy soul in times of famine, and will strengthen thy bones; and thou shalt be like a well-watered garden, and like a spring of water, the waters of which will never deceive.
023	ISA	058	012	And they that spring from thee shall build up the ancient ruins; the foundations of many generations shalt thou raise up again: and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breaches, The restorer of paths to the dwelling-place.
023	ISA	058	013	If thou restrain thy foot for the sake of the sabbath, not doing thy business on my holy day; and if thou call the sabbath a delight, the holy day of the Lord, honorable; and honor it by not doing thy usual pursuits, by not following thy own business, and speaking [vain] words:
023	ISA	058	014	Then shalt thou find delight in the Lord; and I will cause thee to tread upon the high places of the earth, and I will cause thee to enjoy the inheritance of Jacob thy father; for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.
023	ISA	059	001	Behold, the Lord's hand is not too short to save; neither his ear too heavy for hearing;
023	ISA	059	002	But your iniquities have ever made a separation between you and your God, and your sins have caused him to hide his face from you, so that he would not hear.
023	ISA	059	003	For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity: your lips have spoken falsehood, your tongue uttereth deception.
023	ISA	059	004	No one admonisheth with righteousness, and no one executeth justice in truth; men trust in naught, and speak lies; they have conceived mischief, and bring forth wickedness.
023	ISA	059	005	Basilisk's eggs do they hatch, and spider's webs do they weave: he that eateth of their eggs must die, and if one be crushed, a viper will break forth.
023	ISA	059	006	Their webs cannot serve for garments, and they cannot clothe themselves with their works: their works are works of wickedness, and the deed of violence is in their hands.
023	ISA	059	007	Their feet run to what is evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of wickedness; wasting and destruction are on their highways.
023	ISA	059	008	The way of peace they know not; and there is no justice on their tracks: their paths they have made unto themselves crooked; whosoever walketh therein knoweth not peace.
023	ISA	059	009	Therefore is justice far from us, nor will happiness overtake us: we ever hope for light, but behold there is darkness; for brightness, but in obscurity must we walk.
023	ISA	059	010	We grope like the blind on the wall, and as if we had no eyes do we grope: we stumble at noonday as in the twilight; we are in complete darkness like the dead.
023	ISA	059	011	We growl all of us like bears, and like doves do we moan sorely; we ever hope for justice, but there is none; for aid, but it is far from us.
023	ISA	059	012	For our transgressions are numerous in thy presence, and our sins testify against us; for of our transgressions are we aware; and our iniquities—we know them;
023	ISA	059	013	We transgressed and denied the Lord, and departed away from our God; we spoke oppression and revolt, conceived and brought forth in our heart words of falsehood.
023	ISA	059	014	And justice is forced to turn backward, and righteousness standeth afar off; for truth stumbled in the street, and equity is not able to enter.
023	ISA	059	015	And thus is the truth missing; and he that departeth from evil is regarded as foolish: and the Lord saw it, and it was displeasing in his eyes that there was no justice.
023	ISA	059	016	And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor; therefore his arm brought him aid, and his righteousness, —yea, this sustained him.
023	ISA	059	017	And he put on righteousness as a coat of mail, and [placed] the helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance as raiment, and wrapped himself with zeal as with a cloak.
023	ISA	059	018	According to the demerits, so will he repay [all], fury to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies; to the islands will he repay what they have merited.
023	ISA	059	019	And they shall fear from the west the name of the Lord, and from the rising of the sun his glory; for there shall come distress like the stream which the Spirit of the Lord urgeth forward.
023	ISA	059	020	But unto Zion shall come the redeemer, and unto those who return from transgression in Jacob, saith the Lord.
023	ISA	059	021	And as for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the Lord, My spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy children, nor out of the mouth of thy children's children, saith the Lord, from henceforth and unto all eternity.
023	ISA	060	001	Arise, give light, for thy light is come; and the glory of the Lord is shining forth over thee.
023	ISA	060	002	For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and a gross darkness the people; but over thee will shine forth the Lord, and his glory will be seen over thee.
023	ISA	060	003	And nations shall walk by thy light, and kings by the brightness of thy shining.
023	ISA	060	004	Lift up thy eyes round about and see, they all are assembled, they come to thee, thy sons are coming from afar, and thy daughters are brought along in arms.
023	ISA	060	005	Then wilt thou see and be filled with light, and thy heart will dread and be enlarged; because unto thee shall be turned the abundance of the sea, the riches of nations shall come unto thee.
023	ISA	060	006	The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of Midian and 'Ephah; they all from Sheba shall come: gold and frankincense shall they carry, and the praises of the Lord shall they announce.
023	ISA	060	007	All the flocks of Kedar shall be assembled unto thee, the rams of Nebayoth shall minister unto thee: they shall come for a favorable acceptance [unto me] upon my altar, and the house of my glory will I glorify.
023	ISA	060	008	Who are these that fly like a cloud, and like the doves, to their windows?
023	ISA	060	009	Yea, unto me [the inhabitants of] the isles shall hasten, and the ships of Tharshish at first, to bring thy sons from afar, their silver and their gold with them, unto the name of the Lord thy God, and to the Holy One of Israel; because he hath glorified thee.
023	ISA	060	010	And the sons of the stranger shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto thee; for in my wrath did I smite thee, but in my favor have I had mercy on thee.
023	ISA	060	011	And thy gates shall stand open continually, day and night shall they not be closed, to bring unto thee the wealth of nations, and their kings led [captive].
023	ISA	060	012	For the nation and the kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish; and the nations shall be utterly destroyed.
023	ISA	060	013	The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir, the cypress, and the box together, to adorn the place of my sanctuary, and the [resting] place of my feet will I glorify.
023	ISA	060	014	And then shall come unto thee bent down the sons of those who afflicted thee, and there shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet all thy revilers; and they shall call thee, The city of the Lord, Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
023	ISA	060	015	Instead that thou wast forsaken and hated, without one to pass through [thee], will I render thee an excellency of everlasting, a joy of all generations.
023	ISA	060	016	And thou shalt suck the milk of nations, and the breast of kings shalt thou suck; and thou shalt know that I the Lord am thy Saviour, and thy Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
023	ISA	060	017	Instead of the copper will I bring gold, and instead of the iron will I bring silver, and instead of wood copper, and instead of the stones iron; and I will set peace as thy authorities, and righteousness as thy taskmasters.
023	ISA	060	018	There shall not be heard any wore violence in thy land, wasting and destruction within thy boundaries; but thou shalt call, Salvation, thy walls, and thy gates, Praise.
023	ISA	060	019	The sun shall not be unto thee any more for a light by day, and for brightness shall the moon not give light unto thee; but the Lord will be unto thee for a light of everlasting, and thy God as thy glory.
023	ISA	060	020	Thy sun shall not go down any more, and thy moon shall not be withdrawn; for the Lord will be unto thee for a light of everlasting, and ended shall be the days of thy mourning,
023	ISA	060	021	And thy people—they all will be righteous, for ever shall they possess the land, the sprout of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may glorify myself.
023	ISA	060	022	The little one shall become a thousand, and the small, a mighty nation: I the Lord will hasten it in its time.
023	ISA	061	001	The Spirit of the Lord Eternal is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to announce good tidings unto the meek: he hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim to captives Liberty, and to prisoners Release;
023	ISA	061	002	To proclaim a year of favor of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all mourners;
023	ISA	061	003	To grant unto the mourners of Zion, —to give unto them ornament in the place of ashes, oil of gladness in the place of mourning, garments of praise in the place of a grieved spirit; that they may be called, Oaks of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he may be glorified.
023	ISA	061	004	And they shall build up the ancient ruins, desolate places of former times shall they raise up, and they shall renew ruined cities, the desolate places of many generations.
023	ISA	061	005	And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien shall be your ploughmen and your vintners.
023	ISA	061	006	But ye, ye shall be called, Priests of the Lord; Ministers of our God, shall be said unto you: the wealth of nations shall ye consume, and in their glory shall ye be placed as possessors.
023	ISA	061	007	In the place of your twofold shame, —and the confusion of which they loudly complained as their portion: therefore in their land shall they possess a twofold [portion]; everlasting joy shall be granted unto them.
023	ISA	061	008	For I the Lord love justice, I hate robbery with burnt-offering: therefore will I give them the recompense of their work in truth, and an everlasting covenant will I make with them.
023	ISA	061	009	And among the nations shall their seed be known, and their offspring in the midst of the people: all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed whom the Lord hath blessed.
023	ISA	061	010	I will be greatly glad in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, with the mantle of righteousness hath he enveloped me, as a bridegroom decketh himself with elegant attire, and as a bride adorneth herself with her bridal array.
023	ISA	061	011	For, as the earth bringeth forth her growth, and as a garden causeth what is sown therein to spring forth: thus will the Lord Eternal cause righteousness and praise to spring forth in the presence of all the nations.
023	ISA	062	001	For the sake of Zion will I not be silent, and for the sake of Jerusalem will I not be quiet; until its righteousness go forth as the brightness [of light], and its salvation as a burning torch.
023	ISA	062	002	And nations shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory; and men shall call thee by a new name, which the mouth of the Lord shall pronounce.
023	ISA	062	003	And thou shalt be a crown of ornament in the hand of the Lord, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.
023	ISA	062	004	Thou shalt not be termed any more “Forsaken,” and thy land shall not be termed any more “Desolate;” for thou shalt be called “My delight in her” [Chephzi-bah], and thy land “Espoused” [Be'ulah]; for the Lord will have delight in thee, and thy land shall be espoused.
023	ISA	062	005	For as a young man espouseth a virgin, so shall thy sons espouse thee; and as the bridegroom is glad over the bride, so will be glad over thee thy God.
023	ISA	062	006	Over thy walls, O Jerusalem, have I appointed watchmen, all the day and all the night, continually, shall they not be silent: ye that make mention of the Lord, take ye no rest.
023	ISA	062	007	And give him no rest, until he have established, and until he have set up Jerusalem as a praise on the earth.
023	ISA	062	008	Sworn hath the Lord by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, I will not give thy corn any more as food for thy enemies, and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy young wine for which thou hast labored;
023	ISA	062	009	But they who gather it shall eat it, and praise the Lord; and they who bring it together shall drink it in the courts of my sanctuary.
023	ISA	062	010	Pass, pass through the gates, make clear the way of the people, cast up, cast up the highway, remove away the stones, lift up a banner over the nations.
023	ISA	062	011	Behold, the Lord hath caused to be heard unto the ends of the earth, “Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.”
023	ISA	062	012	And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the Lord; and thou shalt be called, Sought for, [Derusha,] The city never forsaken.
023	ISA	063	001	Who is this that cometh from Edom, dyed red in his garments from Bozrah? this—glorious in his apparel, moving along in the greatness of his strength? “I who speak in righteousness, mighty to save.”
023	ISA	063	002	Why is redness on thy apparel, and [why are] thy garments as of one that treadeth the wine-press?
023	ISA	063	003	“I have trodden the vat alone, and of the nations there was no man with me; and I trod them down in my anger, and I trampled on them in my fury; and their blood was sprinkled on my garments, and all my raiments have I stained.
023	ISA	063	004	For the day of vengeance was in my heart, and the year of my redeemed was come.
023	ISA	063	005	And I looked, and there was no one to help, and I was astonished, and there was no one to support; and then my own arm aided me, and my fury—this it was that upheld me.
023	ISA	063	006	And I stamped down nations in my anger, and I made them drunken with my fury, and brought down to the earth their victorious strength.”
023	ISA	063	007	The kindnesses of the Lord will I mention, the praises of the Lord, in accordance with all that the Lord hath bestowed on us, and the abundant goodness toward the house of Israel, which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies, and the abundance of his kindnesses.
023	ISA	063	008	And he said, Surely they are my people, children that will not lie; and he became to them a Saviour.
023	ISA	063	009	In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them; in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bore them, and he carried them all the days of old.
023	ISA	063	010	But they rebelled, and grieved his holy Spirit; and he changed himself to become their enemy, and he fought against them.
023	ISA	063	011	Then remembered his people the ancient days of Moses, Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock? where is he that put within him his holy Spirit?
023	ISA	063	012	That displayed by the right hand of Moses his glorious arm; that divided the water before them, to make unto himself an everlasting name?
023	ISA	063	013	That led them through the deeps, as a horse through the wilderness, that they should not stumble?
023	ISA	063	014	As a beast goeth down into the valley, so did the spirit of the Lord bring them to rest; thus didst thou guide thy people, to make unto thyself a glorious name.
023	ISA	063	015	Look down from heaven, and behold, from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory: where are thy zeal and thy mights, the yearning of thy bowels and of thy mercy which are now restrained from me?
023	ISA	063	016	For thou art our father; for Abraham knoweth nothing of us, and Israel recogniseth us not: thou, O Lord, art our father, our Redeemer from everlasting is thy name.
023	ISA	063	017	Why hast thou let us go astray, O Lord, from thy ways, suffered our heart to be hardened against thy fear? Return for the sake of thy servants, the tribes of thy heritage.
023	ISA	063	018	But a brief space were thy holy people in possession, when our adversaries trod down thy sanctuary.
023	ISA	063	019	We are become as though we are those over whom thou hast never ruled, over whom thy name hath not been called.
023	ISA	064	001	Oh that thou mightest rend the heavens, come down: at thy presence would mountains [then] melt away.
023	ISA	064	002	As fire is kindled on brushwood, as water is made to bubble up by fire—to make thy name known to thy adversaries, that at thy presence nations might tremble!
023	ISA	064	003	[As] when thou didst fearful deeds which we had not looked for, thou camest down, [while] at thy presence mountains melted away;
023	ISA	064	004	Yea! what from the beginning of the world men had not heard, not perceived by their hearing; no eye [also] had seen a god beside thee, who could do [the like] for the one that waiteth for him.
023	ISA	064	005	Thou acceptest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, those that remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou wast wroth, for we had sinned on them continually; and can we thus be saved?
023	ISA	064	006	And we are become like an unclean man all of us, and like a soiled garment, all our righteousness; and we wither like a leaf all of us; and our iniquities, like the wind, will bear us away.
023	ISA	064	007	And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth himself up to lay hold of thee; for thou hast hidden thy face from us, and hast let us melt away, through the force of our iniquities.
023	ISA	064	008	But now, O Lord, our father art thou; we are the clay, and thou our fashioner; and the work of thy hand are we all.
023	ISA	064	009	Be not wroth, O Lord, so very greatly, and do not for ever remember [our] iniquity: behold, look, we beseech thee, thy people are we all.
023	ISA	064	010	Thy holy cities are become a wilderness, Zion is become a wilderness, Jerusalem, a desolate place.
023	ISA	064	011	Our holy and beautiful house where our fathers praised thee, is burnt up with fire; and all our costly things are become ruins.
023	ISA	064	012	Wilt thou for these things refrain thyself, O Lord? wilt thou be silent, and afflict us so very greatly?
023	ISA	065	001	I allowed myself to be sought by those that asked not; I let myself be found by those that sought me not: I said, Here am I, here am I, unto a nation that called itself not by my name.
023	ISA	065	002	I spread out my hands all the time unto a rebellious people, that walk in the way which is not good, after their own thoughts;
023	ISA	065	003	[To] the people that provoke me to anger to my face continually; that sacrifice in gardens and burn incense upon [altars of] brick,
023	ISA	065	004	That sit about among the graves, and lodge in the vaults, that eat the flesh of the swine, and [have] broth of abominations [in] their vessels;
023	ISA	065	005	That say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the time.
023	ISA	065	006	Behold, it is written before me; I will not keep silence, till I have recompensed, yea, recompensed into their bosom.—
023	ISA	065	007	Your iniquities and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the Lord, who have burnt incense upon the mountains, and upon the hills have blasphemed me: and I will measure out their work at first into their bosom.
023	ISA	065	008	Thus hath said the Lord, As the new wine is found in the cluster of grapes, and one saith, Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it; so will I do for the sake of my servants, that I will not destroy the whole;
023	ISA	065	009	And I let come forth out of Jacob a seed, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains; and my elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.
023	ISA	065	010	And Sharon shall become a fold of flocks, and the valley of 'Achor a resting-place for herds, for my people that have sought me.
023	ISA	065	011	But ye who forsake the Lord, who forget my holy mountain, that set out a table for the god of Fortune, and that fill for Destiny the drink-offering.—
023	ISA	065	012	Yea, I will destine you to the sword, and all of you shall kneel down to the slaughter; because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spoke, ye did not hear; but ye did what is evil in my eyes, and that wherein I had no delight did ye choose.
023	ISA	065	013	Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty; behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be made ashamed;
023	ISA	065	014	Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry out from pain of heart, and from a broken spirit shall ye howl;
023	ISA	065	015	And ye shall leave behind your name for an oath unto my elect ones, when the Lord Eternal will slay thee; but his servants will he call by another name.
023	ISA	065	016	Whoever there be that blesseth himself on the earth shall bless himself by the true God; and that sweareth on the earth shall swear by the true God; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hidden from my eyes.
023	ISA	065	017	For, behold, I will create new heavens and a new earth; and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind;
023	ISA	065	018	But be ye glad and rejoice unto all eternity in what I create; for, behold, I will create Jerusalem for rejoicing, and her people for gladness.
023	ISA	065	019	And I will rejoice over Jerusalem, and be glad in my people: and there shall not be heard in her any more the voice of weeping, nor the voice of complaint.
023	ISA	065	020	There shall no more come thence an infant of few days, nor an old man that shall not have the full length of his days; for as a lad shall one die a hundred years old; and as a sinner shall be accursed he who [dieth] at a hundred years old.
023	ISA	065	021	And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.
023	ISA	065	022	They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat; for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and the work of their hands shall my elect wear out.
023	ISA	065	023	They shall not toil in vain, nor bring forth unto an early death; for the seed of the blessed of the Lord are they, and their offspring with them.
023	ISA	065	024	And it shall come to pass, that before yet they call will I answer; and while they are still speaking will I hear.
023	ISA	065	025	The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall like the bullock eat straw: and the serpent—dust shall be his food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the Lord.
023	ISA	066	001	Thus hath said the Lord, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: where is there a house that ye can build unto me? and where is the place of my rest?
023	ISA	066	002	For all these things hath my hand made, that all these things came into being, saith the Lord; but upon such a one will I look, upon the poor, and him who is of a contrite spirit, and who trembleth at my word.
023	ISA	066	003	He that slaughtereth the ox, slayeth a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, breaketh the neck of a dog; he that offereth a meat-offering, [offereth] swine's blood; he that burneth incense, blesseth an idol: yea, they have made choice of their own ways, and in their abominations doth their soul delight.
023	ISA	066	004	So will I also make choice of their misfortune, and what they dread will I bring upon them; because I called, and none did answer; I spoke, and they did not hear; and they did what is evil in my eyes, and that in which I delighted not did they choose.
023	ISA	066	005	Hear the word of the Lord, ye that tremble at his word: Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for the sake of my name, said, “Let the Lord be glorified;” but he will appear to your joy, and they shall be made ashamed.
023	ISA	066	006	[There is] a voice of tumult from the city, a voice from the temple, the voice of the Lord who rendereth recompense to his enemies.
023	ISA	066	007	Before she had travailed she brought forth; before yet her pain was come, she was delivered of a man-child.
023	ISA	066	008	Who hath heard the like? who hath seen such things? shall a land be made to travail in one day? or shall a nation be born at once? that Zion hath travailed, also brought forth her children?
023	ISA	066	009	Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith the Lord; or shall I who cause to bring forth, now prevent it? saith thy God.
023	ISA	066	010	Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be delighted over her, all ye that love her; be highly glad with her, all ye that mourn for her.
023	ISA	066	011	In order that ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breast of her consolations; in order that ye may sip, and find pleasure from the abundance of her glory.
023	ISA	066	012	For thus hath said the Lord, Behold, I will extend to her peace like a river, and like a rapid stream the glory of nations, that ye may suck: upon the arm shall ye be borne, and upon knees shall ye be dandled.
023	ISA	066	013	As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and in Jerusalem shall ye be comforted.
023	ISA	066	014	And ye shall see this, and your heart shall be glad, and your bones shall flourish like the grass; and then will be known the hand of the Lord on his servants, and he will be indignant toward his enemies.
023	ISA	066	015	For, behold, the Lord will come with fire, and his chariots will be like the storm-wind, to send forth his anger with fury, and his threatening with flames of fire.
023	ISA	066	016	For by fire will the Lord judge, and by his sword against all flesh: and many shall be the slain of the Lord.
023	ISA	066	017	They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves for the gardens, behind one tree in the midst, they who eat the flesh of the swine, and the abomination, and the mouse, together shall they perish, saith the Lord.
023	ISA	066	018	And I, because of their works and their thoughts, will let it come to pass to gather all the nations and tongues; and they shall come, and shall see my glory.
023	ISA	066	019	And I will display a sign on them, and I will send from them those that escape unto the nations, Tharshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, Thubal, and Javan, the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, and have not seen my glory; and they shall proclaim my glory among the nations.
023	ISA	066	020	And they shall bring all your brethren out of all nations as an offering unto the Lord, upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon dromedaries, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith the Lord, as the children of Israel bring the offering in a clean vessel into the house of the Lord.
023	ISA	066	021	And of them also will I take for priests and for Levites, saith the Lord.
023	ISA	066	022	For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall have permanence before me, saith the Lord, so shall exist permanently your seed and your name.
023	ISA	066	023	And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to the other new moon, and from one sabbath to the other sabbath, shall all flesh come to prostrate themselves before me, saith the Lord.
023	ISA	066	024	And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me; for their worm shall not die, nor shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorrence unto all flesh.

# BOOK	024	JER	Jeremiah	Jeremiah
024	JER	001	001	The words of Jeremiah the son of Chilkiyahu, one of the priests that were in 'Anathoth in the land of Benjamin;
024	JER	001	002	To whom the word of the Lord came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon the king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign,
024	JER	001	003	And who continued [prophet] in the days of Jehoyakim the son of Josiah the king of Judah, until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah the king of Judah, until the carrying away into exile of Jerusalem in the fifth month.
024	JER	001	004	And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
024	JER	001	005	Before yet I had formed thee in thy mother's body I knew thee; and before thou wast yet come forth out of the womb I sanctified thee: a prophet unto the nations did I ordain thee.
024	JER	001	006	And I said, Ah, Lord Eternal! behold, I know not how to speak; for I am [but] a lad.
024	JER	001	007	And the Lord said unto me, Say not, I am [but] a lad; but to whomsoever I may send thee shalt thou go, and whatsoever I may command thee shalt thou speak.
024	JER	001	008	Be not afraid because of them; for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the Lord.
024	JER	001	009	And the Lord stretched forth his hand, and touched [me] therewith on my mouth; and the Lord said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.
024	JER	001	010	See, I have appointed thee this day over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down: to build up, and to plant.
024	JER	001	011	And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I said, A staff of all almond-tree do I see.
024	JER	001	012	And the Lord said unto me, Thou hast well seen; for I am watching over my word to perform it.
024	JER	001	013	And the word of the Lord came unto me the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, A seething pot do I see; and the front thereof is turned from the north.
024	JER	001	014	And the Lord said unto me, Out of the north shall the evil break forth over all the inhabitants of the land,
024	JER	001	015	For, lo, I will call unto all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith the Lord; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and upon all its walls round about, and upon [those of] all the cities of Judah.
024	JER	001	016	And I will call them to account touching all their wickedness, in that they have forsaken me, and have burnt incense unto other gods, and have bowed down unto the works of their own hands.
024	JER	001	017	But do thou gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I may command thee; be not discouraged because of them, lest I humble thee before them.
024	JER	001	018	But I, behold, I have made of thee this day a fortified city, and an iron pillar, and brazen walls over the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against its princes, against its priests, and against the people of the land.
024	JER	001	019	And [although] they fight against thee, they shall not prevail against thee; for with thee am I saith the Lord, to deliver thee.
024	JER	002	001	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
024	JER	002	002	Go and call out before the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus hath said the Lord, I remember unto thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thy espousals, thy going after me in the wilderness, through a land that is not sown.
024	JER	002	003	A holy thing is Israel unto the Lord, the first of his fruits: all that devour him shall incur guilt; evil shall come over them, saith the Lord.
024	JER	002	004	Hear ye the word of the Lord, O house of Jacob, and all ye families of the house of Israel.
024	JER	002	005	Thus hath said the Lord, What fault did your fathers find in me, that they went away far from me, and walked after vanity, and became vain?
024	JER	002	006	That they said not, Where is the Lord that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of wildness, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, through a land through which no one had passed, and where no man had dwelt?
024	JER	002	007	And I brought you into the land of fruitful fields, to eat its fruit and its goodly products; but ye came and ye made unclean my land, and my heritage ye rendered an abomination.
024	JER	002	008	The priests said not, Where is the Lord? and they that handle the law knew me not; and the shepherds transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied in the name of Ba'al, and after things that cannot profit did they walk.
024	JER	002	009	Therefore will I contend yet farther with you, saith the Lord, and with your children's children will I contend.
024	JER	002	010	For pass over to the isles of the Chittites, and see; and unto Kedar send, and consider well and see if any thing like this hath happened.
024	JER	002	011	Hath a nation exchanged its gods, which are yet no gods? and [still] my people hath exchanged its glory for that which can not profit.
024	JER	002	012	Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and let your hair stand at an end, be ye greatly terrified, saith the Lord.
024	JER	002	013	For two evils have my people committed: me have they forsaken, the source of living waters, to hew out for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns, that cannot hold water.
024	JER	002	014	Is Israel a servant? or one born [to servitude] in the house? why hath he been given up to plunder?
024	JER	002	015	[That] over him young lions roared, let their voice resound, and changed his land into a waste, that his cities are burnt, left without an inhabitant?
024	JER	002	016	Even the children of Noph and Thachpanches have crushed the crown of thy head.
024	JER	002	017	Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, through thy forsaking the Lord thy God, while he was leading thee on the [right] way?
024	JER	002	018	And now what hast thou to do on the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Shichor? and what hast thou to do on the way of Asshur, to drink the waters of the river?
024	JER	002	019	Thy own wickedness shall chastise thee, and thy backslidings shall correct thee; and thou shalt know and see that evil and bitter was thy forsaking the Lord thy God, while the dread of me was not upon thee, saith the Lord Eternal of hosts.
024	JER	002	020	Because from yore did I break thy yoke, did I burst asunder thy bands; and thou saidst, I will not transgress: nevertheless upon every high hill and under every green tree thou makest thy bed, as harlot.
024	JER	002	021	Yet I had planted thee as a branch of a noble vine, wholly of the proper seed; but how art thou changed unto me into a degenerate plant of an ignoble vine?
024	JER	002	022	For though thou wash thyself with natron, and take for thyself much soap: yet would the stain of thy iniquity remain before me, saith the Lord Eternal.
024	JER	002	023	How canst thou say, I am not become unclean, after the Be'alim have I not gone? see thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: [like] a swift dromedary bound fast to her ways;
024	JER	002	024	[Like] a wild ass used to the wilderness, that at her pleasure snuffeth up the wind; her lust—who can turn this away? all they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month will they find her.
024	JER	002	025	“Prevent thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from being thirsty;” but thou saidst, It is useless; no, for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.
024	JER	002	026	As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so have the house of Israel been made ashamed, they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets,
024	JER	002	027	Who say to the wood, Thou art my father; and to the stone, Thou hast brought us forth; for they have turned their back unto me, and not their face; but in the time of their misfortune will they say, Arise, and save us.
024	JER	002	028	But where are then thy gods that thou hast made for thyself? let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy misfortune; for equal to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah.
024	JER	002	029	Wherefore will ye contend with me? all of you have transgressed against me, saith the Lord.
024	JER	002	030	To no purpose have I smitten your children; correction they accepted not: your sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.
024	JER	002	031	O [present] generation, regard ye the word of the Lord. Have I been a wilderness unto Israel? a land of deep darkness? wherefore say my people, We wander about; we cannot come any more unto thee?
024	JER	002	032	Can a virgin forget her ornament, or a bride her decorations? yet my people have forgotten me days without number.
024	JER	002	033	Why ornamentest thou thy way to seek for love? truly even the worst hast thou used thyself as thy ways.
024	JER	002	034	Also on thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the innocent needy ones: not while breaking in [thy house] didst thou find them; but for all these things.
024	JER	002	035	Yet thou sayest, Yea, I am innocent, surely his anger is already turned away from me. Behold, I will hold judgment with thee, because thou sayest, I have not sinned.
024	JER	002	036	Why makest thou thyself so very low to change thy way? also because of Egypt shalt thou be made ashamed, as thou wast put to shame because of Assyria.
024	JER	002	037	Also from this one shalt thou go forth, with thy hands [clasped] over thy head; for the Lord hath rejected those on whom thou trustest and thou shalt not prosper with them.
024	JER	003	001	One could say, Behold, if a man send away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man's, can he return unto her again? would not that land be greatly polluted? and thou hast played the harlot with many companions, and wilt yet return to me, saith the Lord.
024	JER	003	002	Lift up thy eyes unto the mountain-tops, and see where thou hast not been lain with. On public roads hast thou sat for them, as the Arab in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy incests and with thy wickedness.
024	JER	003	003	And [though] the early showers were withholden, and the latter rain came not: yet hadst thou a forehead of an incestuous wife, thou refusedst to feel shame.
024	JER	003	004	Wilt thou not from this time call out unto mem My father, the guide of my youth art thou?
024	JER	003	005	Will he bear grudge for ever? will he keep it to eternity? Behold, thou hast spoken [this], and yet hast done the things that are evil as much as thou wast able.
024	JER	003	006	And the Lord said unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast thou seen what backsliding Israel hath done? she is gone upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and hath played the harlot there.
024	JER	003	007	And I thought that after she had done all these things, she would return unto me. But she returned not. And this saw her treacherous sister Judah.
024	JER	003	008	And I saw, that, although because backsliding Israel had committed adultery, I had sent her away, and given her bill of divorce unto her, still treacherous Judah her sister feared not, but went and played herself the harlot also.
024	JER	003	009	And it came to pass through her giddy incest, that she defiled the land, and committed adultery with stone and with wood.
024	JER	003	010	And yet with all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not returned unto me with all her heart, but with falsehood, saith the Lord.
024	JER	003	011	And the Lord said unto me, The backsliding Israel hath justified herself through the treacherous Judah.
024	JER	003	012	Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, thou backsliding Israel, saith the Lord: I will not cause my anger to fall upon you; for I am full of kindness, saith the Lord, I will not hear grudge for ever.
024	JER	003	013	Only acknowledge thy iniquity, that against the Lord thy God thou hast rebelled, and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree, and that unto my voice ye have not hearkened, saith the Lord.
024	JER	003	014	Return, O backsliding children, saith the Lord; for I am become your husband; and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and bring you to Zion:
024	JER	003	015	And I will give you shepherds after my own heart, and they shall feed you with knowledge and intelligence.
024	JER	003	016	And it shall come to pass, when ye multiply and increase in the land, in those days, saith the Lord, that men shall not say any more, “The ark of the covenant of the Lord;” nor shall it come any more to mind; nor shall they remember it; nor shall they mention it; nor shall any thing be done any more [with it].
024	JER	003	017	At that time shall they call Jerusalem, The throne of the Lord; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of the Lord, to Jerusalem: and they shall not walk any more after the stubbornness of their evil heart.
024	JER	003	018	In those days shall the house of Judah walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north unto the land that I have given for an inheritance unto your fathers.
024	JER	003	019	But I had thought, How shall I establish thee among the [other] sons [of man], and give thee a desirable land, a heritage of glory of the hosts of nations? and I thought, My father thou wouldst call me, and that from me thou wouldst not turn away.
024	JER	003	020	But truly as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, saith the Lord.
024	JER	003	021	A voice is now heard upon the mountain-tops, the supplicatory weeping of the children of Israel; for they have perverted their way, they have forgotten the Lord their God.
024	JER	003	022	Return, ye backsliding children, I will heal your backslidings. “Behold, we come unto thee; for thou art the Lord our God.
024	JER	003	023	Truly deceptive was [what we hoped for] from the hills, and the multitude on the mountains; truly in the Lord our God is the salvation of Israel.
024	JER	003	024	And shame hath devoured the acquisition of our fathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.
024	JER	003	025	We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth us; for against the Lord our God have we sinned, we and our fathers, from our youth even until this day; and we have not hearkened to the voice of the Lord our God.”
024	JER	004	001	If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the Lord, unto me must thou return; and if thou wilt put away thy abominations out of my sight, then shalt thou not wander about [any more].
024	JER	004	002	And if thou wilt swear, As the Lord liveth, in truth, in justice, and in righteousness: then shall nations bless themselves in him, and in him shall they glorify themselves.
024	JER	004	003	For thus hath said the Lord to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, Plough up your fallow ground, that ye may not sow among thorns.
024	JER	004	004	Circumcise yourselves to the Lord, and remove the obduracy of your heart, O ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn so that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.
024	JER	004	005	Tell ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem, and say, Blow ye the cornet in the land: call out, gather together, and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the fortified cities.
024	JER	004	006	Set up the standard toward Zion; save yourselves by flight, stay not; for evil do I bring from the north, and a great destruction.
024	JER	004	007	The lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of nations hath commenced his march, he is gone forth from his place, to make thy land desolate; and thy cities shall be laid waste, left without an inhabitant.
024	JER	004	008	For this gird yourselves with sackcloths, lament and wail; for the fierce anger of the Lord is not turned away from us.
024	JER	004	009	And it shall come to pass on that day, saith the Lord, that the heart of the king and the heart of the princes shall fail; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder.
024	JER	004	010	Then said I, Ah, Lord Eternal! surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul.
024	JER	004	011	At that time shall be announced to this people and to Jerusalem a dry wind from the mountain-peaks in the wilderness, [coming] on the road to the daughter of my people; not to winnow, nor to cleanse [the corn],
024	JER	004	012	A strong wind from these places shall come unto me: now also will I myself pronounce judgment against them.
024	JER	004	013	Behold, like clouds shall he come up, and like a whirlwind shall be his chariots: swifter than eagles are his horses. “Woe unto us! for we are wasted.”
024	JER	004	014	Wash from wrong doing thy heart, O Jerusalem, in order that thou mayest be saved. How long wilt thou let lodge within thee the thoughts of thy wickedness?
024	JER	004	015	For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth unhappiness from the mountain of Ephraim.
024	JER	004	016	Make ye mention of it to the nations; behold, let it be heard against Jerusalem, that beleaguerers come from a far-off country, and send forth their voice against the cities of Judah.
024	JER	004	017	As keepers of a field are they against her round about; because against me hath she been rebellious, saith the Lord.
024	JER	004	018	Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee: this is thy wickedness, which is so bitter, which so reacheth unto thy heart.
024	JER	004	019	My bowels, my bowels! I am shaken, at the very chambers of my heart; my heart beateth tumultuously in me; I cannot remain silent; because the sound of the cornet hast thou heard, O my soul, the alarm of war.
024	JER	004	020	Ruin upon ruin is called out; for the whole land is wasted: suddenly are my tents wasted, and in a moment, my curtains.
024	JER	004	021	How long shall I see the standard, hear the sound of the cornet?
024	JER	004	022	“Because my people is foolish, me have they not known; sottish children are they, and they have not any understanding: wise are they to do evil, but how to do good they do not know.”
024	JER	004	023	I look at the earth, and, lo, it is without form and void; and toward the heavens, and their light is gone.
024	JER	004	024	I look at the mountains, and, lo, they tremble, and all the hills are moved.
024	JER	004	025	I look, and, lo, there is no man, and all the birds of the heavens are fled.
024	JER	004	026	I look, and, lo, the fruitful country is a wilderness, and all its cities are laid waste at the presence of the Lord, because of the fierceness of his anger.
024	JER	004	027	For thus hath said the Lord, Desolate shall be the whole land; yet a full end will I not make.
024	JER	004	028	For this shall mourn the earth, and black shall be the heavens above; because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and I will not repent, and I will not turn back from it.
024	JER	004	029	From the noise of horsemen and those that shoot with the bow fleeth the whole city; they go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city is forsaken, and not a man dwelleth therein.
024	JER	004	030	And thou, O wasted one, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothe thyself with scarlet, though thou adorn thyself with ornaments of gold, though thou encircle with paint thy eyes: in vain shalt thou make thyself beautiful; the adulterers will despise thee, thy life will they seek.
024	JER	004	031	For a voice as of a woman in travail have I heard, the anguish as of one that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, that groaneth, that spreadeth out her hands, [saying,] “Woe is me now! for my soul succumbeth to the murderers.”
024	JER	005	001	Roam about through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and notice, and search in its broad places, if ye can find one man, if there be one that executeth justice, that searcheth for truth: and I will pardon it.
024	JER	005	002	And though they say, “As the Lord liveth!” surely they only swear to a falsehood.
024	JER	005	003	O Lord, are not thy eyes [directed] to the truth? thou didst strike them, but they felt it not; thou didst make an end of them, [yet] they refused to accept correction: they made their faces harder than a rock, they refused to return.
024	JER	005	004	Yet I myself thought, Oh these are but poor; they are foolish; for they knew not the way of the Lord, the ordinance of their God.
024	JER	005	005	I had better go unto the great men, and let me speak with them; for these surely know the way of the Lord, the ordinance of their God; but these altogether have broken the yoke, burst the bands.
024	JER	005	006	Therefore slayeth them the lion out of the forest, the wolf of the deserts wasteth them, the leopard lieth in wait against their cities: every one that cometh out thence shall be torn in pieces; because many are their transgressions, very numerous are their backslidings.
024	JER	005	007	How shall I for this pardon thee? thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by those that are not gods: when I had fed them to the full, they then committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the harlot's house.
024	JER	005	008	As robust horses they rose by times in the morning: every one neighed after the wife of his neighbor.
024	JER	005	009	Shall I not for these things inflict punishment? saith the Lord: and shall on a nation such as this my soul not be avenged?
024	JER	005	010	Scale ye her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: remove her young shoots; for they are not the Lord's.
024	JER	005	011	For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, saith the Lord.
024	JER	005	012	They have denied the Lord, and said, “He existeth not; nor will evil come over us; and the sword and famine shall we not see.
024	JER	005	013	And the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them:” thus shall it be done unto them.
024	JER	005	014	Therefore thus hath said the Lord the God of hosts, Because ye speak this word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth to be a fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.
024	JER	005	015	Lo, I will bring over you a nation from afar, O house of Israel, saith the Lord: it is a mighty nation, it is a most ancient nation, a nation whose language thou wilt not know, and thou wilt not understand what they speak.
024	JER	005	016	Their quiver is as an open sepulchre: they are all mighty men.
024	JER	005	017	And they shall consume thy harvest, and thy bread; they shall consume thy sons and thy daughters; they shall consume thy flocks and thy herds; they shall consume thy vines and thy fig-trees; they shall depopulate thy fortified cities, those wherein thou trustedst, with the sword.
024	JER	005	018	Nevertheless even in those days, saith the Lord, will I not make a full end of you.
024	JER	005	019	And it shall come to pass, when ye will say, For what reason hath the Lord our God done all these things unto us? that thou shalt say unto them, In the same manner as ye have forsaken me, and served strange gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not yours.
024	JER	005	020	Announce this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,
024	JER	005	021	Do now hear this, O sottish people, who have no heart; who have eyes, and see not; who have ears, and hear not;
024	JER	005	022	Will ye not fear me? saith the Lord; will ye not tremble at my presence, who have placed the sand as a bound for the sea by an everlasting law, which it can never pass over? and though the waves thereof be upheaved, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it.
024	JER	005	023	But this people hath a stubborn and a rebellious heart: they have departed [from the right] and have gone their way.
024	JER	005	024	And they have not said in their heart, Let us now fear the Lord our God, that giveth rain, the early and the latter rain, in its season: the appointed weeks of the harvest doth he ever preserve for us.
024	JER	005	025	Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have withholden what is good from you.
024	JER	005	026	For there are found among my people wicked men: they lie in wait, as he that layeth snares; they set a trap, they catch men.
024	JER	005	027	As a coop is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore are they become great, and grown rich.
024	JER	005	028	They are grown fat, they are stout; yea, they surpass even the deeds of the wicked: they pronounce no [just] sentence, the sentence of the fatherless, that they might prosper; and the cause of the needy do they not judge.
024	JER	005	029	shall I not for these things inflict punishment? saith the Lord: or shall on a nation such as this my soul not be avenged?
024	JER	005	030	An astonishing and horrible thing is committed in the land;
024	JER	005	031	The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love to have it so; but what will ye do in the end thereof?
024	JER	006	001	Assemble, O ye children of Benjamin, to flee out of the midst of Jerusalem, and in Tekoa, blow the cornet, and on Beth-hakkerem set up a fire signal; for evil is seen [coming] out of the north, and great havoc.
024	JER	006	002	The comely and the delicate, the daughter of Zion do I destroy.
024	JER	006	003	Unto her shall come shepherds with their flocks; they shall pitch their tents against her round about; they shall feed off every one his own place.
024	JER	006	004	Prepare ye war against her! “Arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe unto us! for the day waneth, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.
024	JER	006	005	Arise, and let us go up by night, and let us destroy her palaces.”
024	JER	006	006	For thus hath said the Lord of hosts, Cut ye down trees, and cast up a mound against Jerusalem: this is the city whose time of punishment is come; she is full of oppression in her midst.
024	JER	006	007	As a well sendeth forth its waters, so doth she cause her wickedness to spring forth: violence and robbery are heard in her; in my presence there are continually disease and wounds.
024	JER	006	008	Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, that my soul tear itself not away from thee; that I render thee not desolate, a land which is not inhabited.
024	JER	006	009	Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, They shall thoroughly glean like a vine the remnant of Israel: carry back thy hand as a grape-gatherer frequently to the baskets.
024	JER	006	010	To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot be attentive: behold, the word of the Lord is become unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it.
024	JER	006	011	And I am full of the fury of the Lord; I am weary with sustaining it: [I must] pour it out over the child in the street, and over the assembly of young men together; for even the husband with the wife shall be seized, the aged with him that is full of days.
024	JER	006	012	And their houses shall be transferred unto others, fields and wives together; for I will stretch out my hand over the inhabitants of the land, saith the Lord.
024	JER	006	013	For from their least even unto their greatest, every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one practiseth falsehood.
024	JER	006	014	And they heal the breach of the daughter of my people very lightly, saying, Peace, peace: when there is no peace.
024	JER	006	015	They should have been ashamed, because they had committed an abomination; but they neither felt the least shame, nor did they know how to blush: therefore shall they fall among those that fall; at the time that I punish their sin shall they stumble, saith the Lord.
024	JER	006	016	Thus hath said the Lord, Place yourselves on the ways, and see, and ask after the ancient paths, where is the way which is good, that ye may walk thereon, and find rest for your soul. But they said, We will not walk [thereon].
024	JER	006	017	Then did I set watchmen over you, [saying,] Listen to the sound of the cornet. But they said, We will not listen.
024	JER	006	018	Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O assembly, what [guilt] is among them.
024	JER	006	019	Hear, O earth! behold, I will bring evil upon this people, the fruit of their thoughts; because unto my words have they not been attentive, and as regardeth my law, —that have they despised.
024	JER	006	020	To what purpose serveth me the frankincense which cometh from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far-off country? your burnt-offerings are not acceptable, and your sacrifices are not agreeable unto me.
024	JER	006	021	Therefore thus hath said the Lord, Behold, I will place before this people stumbling-blocks, and thereon shall stumble the fathers and the sons together, the neighbor and his friend, and they shall perish.
024	JER	006	022	Thus hath said the Lord, Behold, a people is coming from the north country, and a great nation shall wake up from the farthest ends of the earth.
024	JER	006	023	Bow and spear shall they firmly grasp; cruel are they, and will have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and upon horses do they ride; set in array as one man for the war, against thee, O daughter of Zion.
024	JER	006	024	We have heard the fame of him—our hands grow feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, pain, as of a woman in giving birth.
024	JER	006	025	Go not forth into the field, on the road must ye not walk; for [there is] the sword of the enemy, terror on every side.
024	JER	006	026	O daughter of my people, gird thyself with sackcloth, and roll thyself in the ashes: a mourning as for an only son prepare unto thee, a most bitter lamentation; for suddenly will the destroyer come over us.
024	JER	006	027	I have set thee for a tower and a fortress among my people, that thou mayest know and probe their way.
024	JER	006	028	They all are grievous revolters, going about as talebearers, copper and iron: they all are corrupt.
024	JER	006	029	The bellows are burnt, by the fire the lead is consumed: in vain the melter refineth; for the wicked are not separated away.
024	JER	006	030	Refuse silver men call them; because the Lord hath rejected them.
024	JER	007	001	The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying,
024	JER	007	002	Place thyself in the gate of the house of the Lord, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of the Lord, all ye of Judah, that enter in by these gates to bow down before the Lord.
024	JER	007	003	Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your ways and your deeds, and I will permit you to dwell in this place.
024	JER	007	004	[But] do not rely on the words of falsehood, saying, The temple of the Lord, The temple of the Lord, The temple of the Lord, [as] they [say].
024	JER	007	005	For if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your deeds; if ye thoroughly execute justice between a man and his neighbor;
024	JER	007	006	If ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, and walk not after other gods to your own hurt:
024	JER	007	007	Then will I permit you to dwell in this place, in the land that I have given to your fathers, from eternity to eternity.
024	JER	007	008	Behold, ye rely on the words of falsehood, that cannot profit.
024	JER	007	009	How? will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense unto Ba'al, and walk after other gods of which ye have no knowledge;
024	JER	007	010	And [then] come and stand before my presence in this house, which is called by my name, and say, “We are delivered;” in order to do all these abominations?
024	JER	007	011	Is then this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? [But] I also, behold, I have seen it, saith the Lord.
024	JER	007	012	For go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I caused my name to dwell at the first, and see what I did unto it because of the wickedness of my people Israel.
024	JER	007	013	And now, whereas ye have done all these acts, saith the Lord, and I spoke unto you, causing [the prophets] to rise up early and speaking, while ye would not hear; and I called you, but ye would not answer:
024	JER	007	014	Therefore will I do unto this house, which is called by my name, whereon ye rely, and unto the place which I have given to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh.
024	JER	007	015	And I will cast you out of my presence, as I have cast out all your brethren, all the seed of Ephraim.
024	JER	007	016	But thou—pray not thou in behalf of this people, nor lift up in their behalf entreaty or prayer, nor make intercession to me; for I will not hear thee.
024	JER	007	017	Dost thou not see what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
024	JER	007	018	The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead dough, to make cakes for the queen of heaven, and they pour out drink-offerings unto other gods, in order to provoke me to anger.
024	JER	007	019	Do they provoke me to anger? saith the Lord, [and] not themselves, to the shame of their own faces?
024	JER	007	020	Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold my anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place, over man, and over beast, and over the trees of the field, and over the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and it shall not be quenched.
024	JER	007	021	Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Add your burnt-offerings unto your peace-sacrifices, and eat the flesh thereof.
024	JER	007	022	For I spoke not with your fathers, and I commanded them not on the day of my bringing them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt-offering or sacrifice;
024	JER	007	023	But this thing did I command them, saying, Hearken to my voice, and I will be unto you for a God, and ye shall be unto me for a people; and walk ye altogether on the way which I may command you, in order that it may be well unto you.
024	JER	007	024	Yet they hearkened not, and inclined not their ear; but they walked in the counsels, in the stubbornness of their evil heart; and they went backward, and not forward:
024	JER	007	025	Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt until this day; and I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, sending them daily in the morning early;
024	JER	007	026	Yet they hearkened not unto me, and inclined not their ear; but they hardened their neck; they did worse than their fathers.
024	JER	007	027	And if thou speak unto them all these words, and they will not hearken to thee; and if thou call unto them, and they will not answer thee:
024	JER	007	028	Then shalt thou say unto them, This is the nation that hearken not to the voice of the Lord their God, and accept not correction; lost is the truth, and is obliterated from their mouth.
024	JER	007	029	Cut off thy flowing hair, and cast it away, and take up on mountain-tops a lamentation; for rejected hath the Lord and forsaken the generation of his wrath.
024	JER	007	030	For the children of Judah have done what is evil in my eyes, saith the Lord: they have set up their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to pollute it.
024	JER	007	031	And they have built the high-places of Thophet, which is in the valley of Ben-hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I had not commanded, and which never came into my mind.
024	JER	007	032	Therefore, behold days are coming, saith the Lord, that it shall not be called any more Thophet, or The valley of Ben-hinnom, but The valley of slaughter: and they shall bury in Thophet, for want of room.
024	JER	007	033	And the carcasses of this people shall become food unto the fowls of the heavens, and unto the beasts of the earth, with none to chase them away.
024	JER	007	034	And I will cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of gladness, and the voice of joy, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride; for a desert shall the land become.
024	JER	008	001	At that time, saith the Lord, shall they bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves.
024	JER	008	002	And they shall spread them out before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven, which they have loved, and which they have served, and after which they have walked, and which they have sought, and to which they have prostrated themselves: they shall not be gathered up, and they shall not be buried; dung upon the face of the ground shall they become.
024	JER	008	003	And death shall be preferable to life, for all the residue of those that are left of this evil family, who are left in all the places whither I shall have driven them, saith the Lord of hosts.
024	JER	008	004	And thou shalt say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord, Shall they fall, and not arise? will he turn away, and not return?
024	JER	008	005	Why then remaineth this people, Jerusalem, rebellious by a perpetual backsliding? they hold fast on deceit, they refuse to return.
024	JER	008	006	I listened and heard, but they would not speak aright; no man repented him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one turned again to his course, as the impetuous horse in the battle.
024	JER	008	007	Yea, the stork in the heavens knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle, and the swallow, atad the crane observe the time of their coming home; but my people know not the ordinance of the Lord.
024	JER	008	008	How can ye say, We are wise, and the law of the Lord is with us? Truly, behold in vain wrought the pen, in vain the writers.
024	JER	008	009	The wise men are ashamed, they are discouraged and caught, lo, the word of the Lord have they rejected; and what wisdom have they [now]?
024	JER	008	010	Therefore will I give their wives unto others, their fields to conquerors; for from the least even unto the greatest, every one is seeking his own gain: from the prophet even unto the priest every one practiseth falsehood.
024	JER	008	011	And they heal the breach of the daughter of my people very lightly, saying, Peace, peace: when there is no peace.
024	JER	008	012	They should have been ashamed, because they had committed abomination; but they neither felt the least shame, nor did they know how to blush: therefore shall they fall among those that fall; at the time of their punishment shall they stumble, saith the Lord.
024	JER	008	013	I will surely make an end of them, saith the Lord: [there shall be left] no grapes on the vine, and no figs on the fig-tree, and the leaf shall wither; and the things that I have given them shall pass away from them.
024	JER	008	014	“Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the fortified cities, and let us be silent there; for the Lord our God hath put us to silence, and given us poison-water to drink; because we have sinned against the Lord.
024	JER	008	015	We hoped for peace, but no happiness is here; for a time of cure, and behold here is terror.”
024	JER	008	016	From Dan was heard the snorting of his horses; at the sound of the neighing of his war-steeds trembleth the whole land: and they are come, and devour the land, and all that filleth it; the city, and those that dwell therein.
024	JER	008	017	For, behold, I will send out against you serpents, basilisks, for which there is no charm, and they shall bite you, saith the Lord.
024	JER	008	018	When I would cheer myself up against sorrow, my heart within me is pained.
024	JER	008	019	Behold [I hear] the voice of the complaint of the daughter of my people [coming] out of a far-off land: “Is the Lord not in Zion? is her king no more in her?” “Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images, and with the vanities of the stranger?”
024	JER	008	020	“The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not yet helped.”
024	JER	008	021	Because of the breach of the daughter of my people am I broken: I am grieved; astonishment hath taken fast hold on me.
024	JER	008	022	Is there no [more] balm in Gil'ad? or is no physician there? why then is there not placed a plaster [on the wound of] the daughter of my people?
024	JER	009	001	Oh that one would make my head water, and my eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughters of my people!
024	JER	009	002	Oh that one would place me in the wilderness in a lodging-place of wayfaring men. that I might leave my people, and go from them! for all of them are adulterers, a band of traitors.
024	JER	009	003	And they bend their tongues, their bow of falsehood, and not for the truth are they valiant in the land; for from evil to evil do they proceed, and me they know not, saith the Lord.
024	JER	009	004	Take ye heed every one of his neighbor, and on any brother place ye no reliance; for every brother will surely supplant, and every neighbor will go about as a talebearer.
024	JER	009	005	And they will deceive every one his neighbor, and the truth will they not speak: they have taught their tongue to speak falsehood, they weary themselves to commit iniquity.
024	JER	009	006	Thy habitation is in the midst of deceit: through deceit they refuse to know me, saith the Lord.
024	JER	009	007	Therefore thus hath said the Lord of hosts, Behold, I will melt them, and probe them; for how [else] shall I do because of the daughter of my people?
024	JER	009	008	A murderous arrow is their tongue; [every one] speaketh deceit: with his mouth speaketh he peaceably to his neighbor, but in his heart he layeth wait for him.
024	JER	009	009	Shall I not for these things inflict punishment on them? saith the Lord: or shall not on a nation such as this my soul be avenged?
024	JER	009	010	For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation; because they are burnt up, so that no man can pass through them; and they hear not the voice of the cattle: both the fowls of the heavens and the beasts are fled; they are gone away.
024	JER	009	011	And I will change Jerusalem into heaps of ruins, a dwelling for monsters: and the cities of Judah will I make desolate, without an inhabitant.
024	JER	009	012	Who is the wise man, that may understand this? and who is he to whom the mouth of the Lord hath spoken, that he may declare it: for what is the land destroyed, burnt up like the wilderness, without one that passeth through?
024	JER	009	013	And the Lord said, Because they forsook my law which I had set before them, and hearkened not to my voice, and walked not therein;
024	JER	009	014	But have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart, and after the Be'alim, which their fathers had taught them.
024	JER	009	015	Therefore thus hath said the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will feed them—this people, with wormwood, and give them poison-water to drink.
024	JER	009	016	And I will scatter them among the nations, whom neither they nor their fathers have known: and I will send out after them the sword, till I have consumed them.
024	JER	009	017	Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, Consider it well, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for the women skilled in lament, that they may come;
024	JER	009	018	And let them make haste, and take up for us a lamentation, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids drop down water.
024	JER	009	019	For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we wasted! we are greatly ashamed; because we have forsaken the land, because they have cast down our dwellings.
024	JER	009	020	For hear, O ye women, the word of the Lord, and let your ear perceive the word of his mouth, and teach your daughters wailing, and every one her neighbor lamentation.
024	JER	009	021	For death is come up through our windows, is entered into our palaces; to cut off the children from the street, the young men from the open places.
024	JER	009	022	Speak, Thus saith the Lord, Yea, the carcasses of men shall lie as dung upon the open field, and as the sheaves [left] after the harvestman, with none to gather them.
024	JER	009	023	Thus hath said the Lord, Let not the wise glorify himself in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glorify himself in his might, let not the rich glorify himself in his riches;
024	JER	009	024	But let him that glorifieth himself glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord who exercise kindness, justice, and righteousness, on the earth; for in these things I delight, saith the Lord.
024	JER	009	025	Behold, days are coming, saith the Lord, that I will send punishment on all the circumcised who are [yet] uncircumcised;
024	JER	009	026	On Egypt, and on Judah, and on Edom, and on the children of 'Ammon, and on Moab, and all who have the locks of their hair cut off round that dwell in the wilderness; for all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart.
024	JER	010	001	Hear ye the word which the Lord hath spoken concerning you, O house of Israel:
024	JER	010	002	Thus hath said the Lord, Do not habituate yourselves on the way of the nations, and at the signs of the heavens be ye not dismayed; although the nations should be dismayed at them.
024	JER	010	003	For the statutes of these people concern what is vanity; for it is but a tree which a man hath cut out of a forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.
024	JER	010	004	With silver and with gold do they ornament it; with nails and with hammers do they fasten it, that it move not from its place.
024	JER	010	005	As a wrought-out palm-like column are they, and cannot speak; they must needs be borne, because they cannot step along. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do any harm, so also to do any good is not in them.
024	JER	010	006	Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O Lord: thou [alone] art great, and great is thy name in might.
024	JER	010	007	Who would not fear thee, O King of the nations? for to thee doth it appertain; because among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, [they say] there is none like unto thee.
024	JER	010	008	But at once shall they be shown to be brutish and foolish: it is a doctrine of vanities, it concerneth but wood.
024	JER	010	009	The beaten out silver is brought from Tharshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the goldsmith: blue and purple is their clothing; the work of skilful men are they all.
024	JER	010	010	But the Lord God is the truth, he is the living God, and the everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall quake, and nations cannot endure his indignation.
024	JER	010	011	Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, shall perish away from the earth, and from under these heavens.
024	JER	010	012	He made the earth by his power, he established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding he stretched out the heavens.
024	JER	010	013	At the sound when he giveth a multitude of waters in the heavens, and causeth clouds to ascend from the ends of the earth; when he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures:
024	JER	010	014	Then standeth every man as brutish without knowledge; ashamed is every goldsmith because of the graven image; for falsehood is his molten work, and there is no breath therein.
024	JER	010	015	They are vanity, the work of deception; in the time of their punishment shall they vanish.
024	JER	010	016	Not like these is the portion of Jacob; for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance: The Lord of hosts is his name.
024	JER	010	017	Gather up thy wares from the ground, O inhabitress of the beleaguered city.
024	JER	010	018	For thus hath said the Lord, Behold, I will cast forth as with a sling the inhabitants of the land at this time, and I will enclose them, in order that they may find them.
024	JER	010	019	Woe is me for my breach! my wound is painful; but I thought, This is but pain, and I shall be able to bear it.
024	JER	010	020	[But now] my tent is laid waste, and all my cords are torn asunder; my children are gone away from me, and they are not [here]; there is no one to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.
024	JER	010	021	For the shepherds were brutish, and the Lord had they not sought; therefore have they not prospered, and all their flocks are scattered.
024	JER	010	022	Behold, the noise of the report is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to render the cities of Judah desolate, a dwelling for monsters.
024	JER	010	023	I know, O Lord, that the way of man is not in his own power: it is not in man that passeth away to direct his own steps.
024	JER	010	024	Correct me, O Lord, but with justice; not in thy anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.
024	JER	010	025	Pour out thy fury over the nations that know thee not, and over the families that have not called on thy name; for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his dwelling desolate.
024	JER	011	001	The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying,
024	JER	011	002	Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak unto the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
024	JER	011	003	And say thou unto them, Thus hath said the Lord God of Israel, Cursed be the man that hearkeneth not to the words of this covenant,
024	JER	011	004	Which I commanded your fathers on the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace, saying, Hearken to my voice, and do the same, in accordance with all which I may command you; and so shall ye be to me for a people, and I will be to you for a God;
024	JER	011	005	In order that I may fulfill the oath which I have sworn unto your fathers, to give unto them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day. And I answered, and said, So be it, O Lord.
024	JER	011	006	Then said the Lord unto me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye the words of this covenant, and do them.
024	JER	011	007	For I earnestly warned your fathers on the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt even until this day, sending out early and warning, saying, Hearken to my voice;
024	JER	011	008	Yet they hearkened not, and inclined not their ear, but walked every one in the stubbornness of their evil heart: therefore did I bring over them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do; but which they did not.
024	JER	011	009	And the Lord said unto me, A conspiracy hath been found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
024	JER	011	010	They are returned again to the iniquities of their earlier forefathers, who had refused to hearken to my words; and they themselves are [also] gone after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.
024	JER	011	011	Therefore thus hath said the Lord, Behold, I will bring an evil upon them, from which they shall not be able to rid themselves; and they will cry unto me, but I will not hearken unto them.
024	JER	011	012	Then let the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem go, and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense; but they shall not save them in the least in the time of their distress.
024	JER	011	013	For equal to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah; and equal to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to the disgraceful idol, altars, to burn incense unto Ba'al.
024	JER	011	014	But thou—thou must not pray in behalf of this people, neither lift up in their behalf entreaty or prayer; for I will not hear at the time that they call unto me, because of their distress.
024	JER	011	015	What hath my beloved to do in my house, while she executeth the evil counsel of so many [sinners]? Yea, the holy flesh passeth away from thee; for even with thy wickedness, thou rejoicest still.
024	JER	011	016	An ever-green olive-tree, beautiful in fruit and form, did the Lord call thy name: with the noise of a great tumult hath he kindled fire around it, and they break off its branches.
024	JER	011	017	And the Lord of hosts, that planted thee, hath decreed evil against thee; on account of the wickedness of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done against themselves, to provoke me to anger in offering incense unto Ba'al.
024	JER	011	018	And the Lord hath given me knowledge of it, and I know it: then didst thou let me see their doings.
024	JER	011	019	But I was like a sheep or an ox that is brought to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me, [saying,] “Let us destroy the tree with its fruit, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may not be remembered any more.”
024	JER	011	020	But, O Lord of hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them; for unto thee have I entrusted my cause.
024	JER	011	021	Therefore thus hath said the Lord concerning the men of 'Anathoth, that seek thy life, saying, “Thou shalt not prophesy in the name of the Lord, that thou mayest not die by our hand:”
024	JER	011	022	Therefore thus hath said the Lord of hosts, Behold, I will inflict punishment on them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by the famine;
024	JER	011	023	And no remnant shall remain of them; for I will bring evil upon the men of 'Anathoth, in the year of their punishment.
024	JER	012	001	[Too] righteous art thou, O Lord, that I could plead with thee; yet must I speak of [the principles of] justice with thee: Wherefore is the way of the wicked happy? do all those prosper that deal treacherously?
024	JER	012	002	Thou hast planted them; they have also taken root; they grow; they also bring forth fruit: thou art near, in their mouth, and far from their mind.
024	JER	012	003	But thou, O Lord, knowest me; thou seest me, and probest my heart toward thee; set them apart like sheep for the slaughter, and destine them for the day of slaying.
024	JER	012	004	How long shall the land mourn, and the herb of all the field wither? Because of the wickedness of those that dwell therein are wholly removed the beasts and the birds; because they said, He will not see our last end.
024	JER	012	005	If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, how then canst thou contend with the horses? and if in the land of peace, [wherein] thou trustedst, [they wearied thee,] how then wilt thou do in the swelling of the Jordan?
024	JER	012	006	For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; yea, even they have called forth a crowd of men after thee: believe them not, though they speak kindly unto thee.
024	JER	012	007	I have forsaken my house, I have abandoned my heritage; I have given up the most dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.
024	JER	012	008	My heritage is become unto me as a lion in the forest; it sent forth its voice against me: therefore do I hate it.
024	JER	012	009	Is my heritage become unto me as a bird of prey stained with blood? so that the birds of prey are all around it? Come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, bring them hither to devour.
024	JER	012	010	Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden under foot my field, they have rendered my pleasant field a desolate wilderness.
024	JER	012	011	They have made it a desert, and being desolate it mourneth before me: the whole land is made desolate, because no man laid it to heart.
024	JER	012	012	Over all the mountain-peaks in the wilderness did the destroyers come; for the sword of the Lord devoureth from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land: there is no peace to any flesh.
024	JER	012	013	They have sown wheat, but they reap thorns; they have put themselves to pain [but] have no profit; be therefore ashamed of your products, because of the fierce anger of the Lord.
024	JER	012	014	Thus hath said the Lord against all my bad neighbors, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit, Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and the house of Judah will I pluck out from the midst of them.
024	JER	012	015	And it shall come to pass, that, after I have plucked them out, and I will again have mercy on them, and will restore them, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.
024	JER	012	016	And it shall come to pass, if they will truly learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, As the Lord liveth; as they had taught my people to swear by Ba'al: that they shall then be built up in the midst of my people.
024	JER	012	017	But if they will not hearken, then will I pluck out that nation, plucking out and exterminating [them], saith the Lord.
024	JER	013	001	Thus said the Lord unto me, Go and buy thee a linen girdle, and put it around thy loins, and lay it not in water.
024	JER	013	002	So I bought the girdle, according to the word of the Lord, and put it around my loins.
024	JER	013	003	And the word of the Lord came unto me the second time, saying,
024	JER	013	004	Take the girdle that thou hast bought, which is around thy loins; and arise, go to the Euphrates, and hide it there in a cleft of the rock.
024	JER	013	005	So I went, and hid it by the Euphrates, as the Lord has commanded me.
024	JER	013	006	And it came to pass at the end of many days, that the Lord said unto me, Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take from there the girdle, which I commanded thee to hide there.
024	JER	013	007	And I went to the Euphrates, and dug, and took the girdle from the place where I had hidden it: and, behold, the girdle was spoiled, it was useful for nothing.
024	JER	013	008	Then came the word of the Lord unto me, saying,
024	JER	013	009	Thus hath said the Lord, After this manner will I destroy the pride of Judah, and the pride of Jerusalem, which is great.
024	JER	013	010	And this bad people, who refuse to hearken to my words, who walk in the stubbornness of their heart, and have followed other gods, to serve them, and to bow down to them, shall even be as this girdle which is useful for nothing.
024	JER	013	011	For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so had I caused to cleave unto me all the house of Israel and all the house of Judah, saith the Lord, —to become unto me a people, and [to be] for a name, and for praise, and for honor; but they would not hear.
024	JER	013	012	Therefore shalt thou say unto them this word, Thus hath said the Lord the God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine: and when they will say unto thee, Do we not know full well that every bottle shall be filled with wine?
024	JER	013	013	Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit after David upon his throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.
024	JER	013	014	And I will dash them one against the other, even the fathers and the sons together, saith the Lord: I will not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, so as not to destroy them.
024	JER	013	015	Hear ye, and bend your ear: be not proud; for the Lord hath spoken.
024	JER	013	016	Give unto the Lord your God glory, before he cause darkness, and before your feet strike upon the mountains of twilight, and [where], while ye look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and change it into gross darkness.
024	JER	013	017	But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places because of [your] pride; and my eye shall weep sorely, and run down with tears, because the flock of the Lord is driven away captive.
024	JER	013	018	Say unto the king and to the queen-mother, Sit down very lowly; for sunk down are your head-attires, the crown of your ornament.
024	JER	013	019	The cities of the south are shut up, and there is no one to open them: Judah is carried away into exile altogether, it is carried into exile completely.
024	JER	013	020	Lift up your eyes, and see those that are coming from the north: where is the flock that was given thee, thy splendid flock?
024	JER	013	021	What wilt thou say when he will punish thee? since thou hast accustomed them to be over thee captains, and chiefs? shall not pangs seize upon thee, as on a woman in travail?
024	JER	013	022	And if thou wilt say in thy heart, Wherefore come these things upon me? For the greatness of thy iniquity are thy skirts laid open, thy heels are made bare violently.
024	JER	013	023	Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? [then] may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.
024	JER	013	024	Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away before the wind of the wilderness.
024	JER	013	025	This is thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me, saith the Lord; because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.
024	JER	013	026	Therefore do I also strip up thy skirts over thy face, that thy shame may be seen.
024	JER	013	027	Thy adulteries and thy loud shoutings, the lewdness of thy incest, thy abominations on the hills in the fields have I seen. Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem! thou wilt not be made clean after ever so long a time.
024	JER	014	001	The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought.
024	JER	014	002	Judah mourneth, and her gates languish; they lie grieved on the ground; and the distressed cry of Jerusalem ascendeth upward.
024	JER	014	003	And their nobles have sent out their subordinates for water: they come to the pits, they find no water; they return with their vessels empty; they are ashamed and confounded, and cover their head.
024	JER	014	004	Because of the ground which is cracked open, since there hath been no rain in the land, are the ploughmen ashamed, they cover their head.
024	JER	014	005	Yea, the hind also bringeth forth her young in the field, and forsaketh [them], because there is no grass.
024	JER	014	006	And the wild asses stand on the mountain-tops, they snuff up the wind like serpents: their eyes fail, because there are no herbs.
024	JER	014	007	If our iniquities testify against us, O Lord, do thou act for the sake of thy name; for our backslidings are many; against thee have we sinned.
024	JER	014	008	O thou hope of Israel, his saviour in time of trouble, why shouldst thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfarer that turneth aside to lodge for a night?
024	JER	014	009	Why shouldst thou be as a man that is surprised, as a mighty man that cannot save? yet thou art in the midst of us, O Lord, and we are called by thy name: abandon us not.
024	JER	014	010	Thus hath said the Lord unto this people, Thus have they loved to wander about, their feet have they not restrained: therefore the Lord doth not receive them in favor; now will he remember their iniquity, and will punish their sins.
024	JER	014	011	Then said the Lord unto me, Pray not in behalf of this people for their good.
024	JER	014	012	When they fast, I will not hear their entreaty: and when they offer burnt-offering and meat-offering, I will not receive them in favor; but by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence, will I make an end of them.
024	JER	014	013	Then said I, Ah, Lord Eternal! behold, the prophets say unto them, Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but a permanent peace will I give you in this place.
024	JER	014	014	Then said the Lord unto me, Falsehood do the prophets prophesy in my name; I have not sent them, neither have I commanded them, neither have I spoken unto them: a vision of falsehood, and divination, and idolatrous folly, and the deceit of their heart do they prophesy unto you.
024	JER	014	015	Therefore thus hath said the Lord concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, when I have not sent them, while they say, Sword and famine shall not come in this land: By the sword and by the famine shall these prophets come to their end.
024	JER	014	016	And the people to whom they prophesy shall lie cast down in the streets of Jerusalem by means of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters; for I will pour out their wickedness over them.
024	JER	014	017	But thou shalt say unto them this word. My eyes shall run down with tears night and day, and they shall not cease; for with a great breach is the virgin-daughter of my people broken, with a very painful blow.
024	JER	014	018	If I go forth into the field, behold, there are the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, behold, there are those that are sick with famine! for both the prophet and the priest travel round into a land that they know not.
024	JER	014	019	Hast thou entirely rejected Judah? or hath thy soul loathing on Zion? why hast thou smitten us, so that there is no healing for us? we hoped for peace, and there is no good; and for the time of healing, and behold, there is terror!
024	JER	014	020	We know, O Lord, our wickedness, the iniquity of our fathers; for we have sinned against thee.
024	JER	014	021	Do not cast us off, for the sake of thy name, do not disgrace the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us.
024	JER	014	022	Are there any among the vanities of the nations those that bestow rain? or can the heavens give forth showers? Behold, thou art this, O Lord our God, and we will hope in thee; for thou hast done all these things.
024	JER	015	001	And the Lord said unto me, If Moses and Samuel were to stand before me, my favor would [still] not be toward this people: send them away out of my sight, that they may go forth.
024	JER	015	002	And it shall come to pass, if they should say unto thee, Whither shall we go forth, that thou shalt say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord, Such as are destined to death, to death; and such as are destined to the sword, to the sword; and such as are destined to famine, to famine; and such as are destined to captivity, to captivity.
024	JER	015	003	And I will appoint over them four species, saith the Lord: The sword to slay, and the dogs to drag away, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and to destroy.
024	JER	015	004	And I will cause them to become a horror unto all the kingdoms of the earth, on account of Menasseh the son of Hezekiah the king of Judah, because of what he did in Jerusalem.
024	JER	015	005	For who will have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who will condole with thee? or who will go aside to ask after thy welfare?
024	JER	015	006	Thou hast indeed forsaken me, saith the Lord, thou art gone backward; therefore do I stretch out my hand against thee, and destroy thee: I am weary with repenting.
024	JER	015	007	And I winnow them with a fan in the gates of the land: I make childless, I annihilate my people, [since] from their ways they have not turned away.
024	JER	015	008	Their widows are more numerous before me than the sand of the seas: I bring unto them, over the mothers of the young men, a waster at noonday; I cause to fall upon her suddenly the enemy with [his] terrors.
024	JER	015	009	She that had born seven children fadeth away; she breatheth out her soul, her sun is set while it is yet day; she is made ashamed and put to the blush: —and their residue will I give up to the sword before their enemies, saith the Lord.
024	JER	015	010	Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast born me, a man of contention and a man of strife to the whole land! I have not lent, nor have men lent to me: [yet] every one of them curseth me.
024	JER	015	011	The Lord said, Truly I will release thee for [thy] good; truly I will cause the enemy to meet thee in the time of distress and in the time of affliction.
024	JER	015	012	Can iron break in pieces the northern iron and copper?
024	JER	015	013	Thy wealth and thy treasures will I give up as spoil without price, and this for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.
024	JER	015	014	And I will cause them to pass over with thy enemies into a land which thou knowest not; for a fire is kindled in my anger, over you shall it burn.
024	JER	015	015	Thou well knowest it, O Lord! remember me and think of me, and avenge me on my persecutors; not according to thy long-suffering act thou for me: know, that for thy sake I have borne shame.
024	JER	015	016	When thy words were made manifest to me, then I greedily received them; and thy word became unto me the gladness and joy of my heart; for thy name is called upon me, O Lord of hosts.
024	JER	015	017	I sat not in the assembly of the mirthful, and was rejoiced; because of thy inspiration I sat solitary; for thou hadst filled me with indignation.
024	JER	015	018	Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable? it refuseth to be healed; it is truly become unto me as a deceptive spring, as waters that are not reliable.
024	JER	015	019	Therefore thus hath said the Lord, If thou return, and I bring thee back again, then shalt thou stand before me; and if thou bring forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: these shall return unto thee; but thou shalt not return unto them.
024	JER	015	020	And I will make thee unto this people as a fortified brazen wall; and they will fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the Lord.
024	JER	015	021	And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the grasp of the tyrants.
024	JER	016	001	And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
024	JER	016	002	Thou shalt not take thyself a wife, neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in this place.
024	JER	016	003	For thus hath said the Lord concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that bear them, and concerning their fathers that beget them in this land:
024	JER	016	004	A death through diseases of famine shall they die; they shall not be lamented for; nor shall they be buried; for dung upon the face of the earth shall they be: and by the sword and by famine shall they come to their end; and their carcasses shall be for food unto the fowls of heaven, and unto the beasts of the earth.
024	JER	016	005	For thus hath said the Lord, Enter not into the house of mourning, neither go to lament nor to condole with them; for I have taken away my peace from this people, saith the Lord, yea, kindness and mercy.
024	JER	016	006	And both the great and the small shall die in this land, — they shall not be buried, and men shall not lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them;
024	JER	016	007	Nor shall they break bread for them at their mourning, to comfort them for the dead; nor shall they give them to drink the cup of consolation for their father and for their mother.
024	JER	016	008	And into the house of feasting shalt thou not enter, to sit with them, to eat and to drink.
024	JER	016	009	For thus hath said the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place before your eyes, and in your days, the voice of gladness, and the voice of joy, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride.
024	JER	016	010	And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt tell this people all these words, and they should say unto thee, Wherefore hath the Lord spoken against us all this great evil? and what is our iniquity? and what is our sin that we have committed against the Lord our God?
024	JER	016	011	That thou shalt say unto them, Because your fathers forsook me, saith the Lord, and walked after other gods, and served them, and bowed down unto them, and me they forsook, and my law they kept not;
024	JER	016	012	And ye act worse than your fathers; for, behold, ye walk every one after the stubbornness of his evil heart, so as not to hearken unto me;
024	JER	016	013	Therefore will I hurl you out of this land into the land of which ye had no knowledge, neither ye nor your fathers; and ye will serve there other gods by day and by night; so that I will not grant you any favor.
024	JER	016	014	Therefore, behold, days are coming, saith the Lord, when it shall not he said any more, As the Lord liveth, who hath brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;
024	JER	016	015	But, As the Lord liveth, who hath brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the countries whither he had driven them: and I will cause them to return unto their land which I have given unto their fathers.
024	JER	016	016	Behold, I will send for many fishermen, saith the Lord, and they shall fish them; and after that will I send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the clefts of the rocks.
024	JER	016	017	For my eyes are directed upon all their ways, they are not hidden from my face, nor is their iniquity concealed from my eyes.
024	JER	016	018	And [thus] will I pay them at the first their two-fold iniquity and their sin; because they have defiled my land, filling my heritage with the carcasses of their detestable and abominable idols.
024	JER	016	019	O Lord, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge on the day of trouble, unto thee shall nations come from the ends of the earth, and say, Nothing but falsehood had our fathers inherited, vanity, wherein there is no profit.
024	JER	016	020	How? can a man make unto himself gods, which are yet no gods?
024	JER	016	021	Therefore, behold, I will cause them to know, at this time will I cause them to know, my hand and my might: and they shall know that my name is The Eternal.
024	JER	017	001	The sin of Judah is written down with a pen of iron, with the point of a diamond: it is engraved upon the table of their heart, and on the horns of your altars.
024	JER	017	002	Like their remembrance of their children, so are [to them] their altars and their groves by [every] green tree upon the high hills.
024	JER	017	003	O my mountain in the field, thy substance, all thy treasures will I give up for spoil, thy high-places [reared] with sin, throughout all thy borders.
024	JER	017	004	And thou shalt be cast out, yea through thy own guilt, from thy heritage which I have given thee; and I will cause thee to serve thy enemies in a land which thou knowest not; for a fire have ye kindled in my anger, for ever shall it burn.
024	JER	017	005	Thus hath said the Lord, Cursed is the man that trusteth in man, and placeth on flesh his dependence, while from the Lord his heart departeth.
024	JER	017	006	And he shall be like a lonely tree in the desert, which feeleth not when the good cometh; but abideth in the parched places in the wilderness, in a salty land which cannot be inhabited.
024	JER	017	007	Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord, and the Lord will be his trust.
024	JER	017	008	And he shall be like a tree that is planted by the waters, and by a stream spreadeth out its roots, which feeleth not when heat cometh, but its leaf remaineth green; and in a year of drought it is undisturbed by care, and ceaseth not from yielding fruit.
024	JER	017	009	Deceitful is the heart above all things, and sick: who can know it?
024	JER	017	010	I the Lord search the heart, probe the reins: yea, to give unto every man according to his ways, according to the fruit of his deeds.
024	JER	017	011	As a cuckoo that sitteth on eggs which he hath not laid, so is he that get the riches, and not by right; in the midst of his days shall he leave them, and at his end shall be called wicked.
024	JER	017	012	A throne of glory, exalted from the beginning, is the place of our sanctuary!
024	JER	017	013	Hope of Israel, O Lord, all that forsake thee shall be made ashamed, and the backsliders among me shall be written down on the earth; because they have forsaken the fountain of living waters, the Lord.
024	JER	017	014	Heal me, O Lord, and I shall be healed: save me, and I shall be saved; for my praise art thou.
024	JER	017	015	Behold, they say unto me, Where is the word of the Lord? let it come now.
024	JER	017	016	As for me, I have not hastened to be a shepherd to follow thee; and the woeful day have I not longed for; thou knowest it: what came out of my lips was known before thee.
024	JER	017	017	Be not a terror unto me: thou art my protection on the day of evil.
024	JER	017	018	Let those be made ashamed that persecute me, but let not me be made ashamed: let them be dismayed, but let me not be dismayed: bring upon them the day of evil, and strike them with a double breach.
024	JER	017	019	Thus said the Lord unto me, Go and stand in the gate of the children of the people, whereby the kings of Judah usually enter, and by which they usually go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem;
024	JER	017	020	And say unto them, Hear ye the word of the Lord, ye kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter in by these gates.
024	JER	017	021	Thus hath said the Lord, Take heed for your souls, and bear no burden on the sabbath-day, nor bring it in through the gates of Jerusalem;
024	JER	017	022	Nor shall you carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath-day, and no manner of work shall ye do, but hallow ye the sabbath-day, as I have commanded your fathers;
024	JER	017	023	But they hearkened not, and inclined not their ear; and they made their neck stiff, so as not to hearken, and not to receive instruction.
024	JER	017	024	And it shall come to pass, if ye will diligently hearken unto me, saith the Lord, so as to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath-day, and to hallow the sabbath-day, so as to do no work thereon:
024	JER	017	025	Then shall there enter through the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and this city shall be inhabited for ever.
024	JER	017	026	And there shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the environs of Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the lowlands, and from the mountain, and from the south, those that bring burnt-offerings, and sacrifices, and meat-offerings, and frankincense, and those that bring thanksgiving-offerings, unto the house of the Lord.
024	JER	017	027	But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath-day, and not to bear a burden, and to enter in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath-day: then will I kindle a fire in its gates, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.
024	JER	018	001	The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying,
024	JER	018	002	Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there will I let thee hear my words.
024	JER	018	003	Then went I down to the potter's house, and, behold, he was doing work on the wheels.
024	JER	018	004	And the vessel that he was making became spoiled as [happeneth] with the clay in the hand of the potter; and he made again thereof another vessel, as it seemed good in the eyes of the potter to make it.
024	JER	018	005	Then came the word of the Lord to me, saying,
024	JER	018	006	Shall I not be able to do unto you as this potter, O house of Israel? saith the Lord. Behold, as the clay is in the potter's hand, so are ye in my hand, O house of Israel.
024	JER	018	007	At one instant I speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy it;
024	JER	018	008	But should that nation, against whom I have spoken, return from their wrong-doing: then will I bethink me of the evil that I had thought to do unto them.
024	JER	018	009	And at one instant I speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it;
024	JER	018	010	But should it do what is evil in my eyes, so as not to hearken to my voice: then will I bethink me of the good, wherewith I had thought to benefit the same.
024	JER	018	011	And now do say to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, as followeth, Thus hath said the Lord, Behold, I form against you evil, and devise against you a device: do but return now every one from his evil way, and amend your ways and your deeds.
024	JER	018	012	And they said, It is useless: for after our own thoughts will we walk, and we will every one do after the stubbornness of his evil heart.
024	JER	018	013	Therefore thus hath said the Lord, Only ask among the nations, Who hath heard the like things? a very horrible act hath the virgin of Israel committed.
024	JER	018	014	Doth the snow of Lebanon ever quit the rock of the field? or do the far-coming, cold, flowing waters ever fail?
024	JER	018	015	That my people have forgotten me, that they have burnt incense to false gods, and are made to stumble on their ways, the ancient beaten tracks, to walk in paths, on a road which is not leveled?
024	JER	018	016	To make their land desolate, a perpetual derision: every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished, and shake his head.
024	JER	018	017	Like an east wind will I scatter them before the enemy; with the back, and not the face, will I regard them on the day of their calamity.
024	JER	018	018	And they said, Come, and let us contrive devices against Jeremiah; for the law will not be lost from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not listen to any of his words.
024	JER	018	019	Listen to me, O Lord, and hearken to the voice of those that contend with me.
024	JER	018	020	Shall evil be recompensed instead of good, that they have dug a pit for my life? Remember my standing before thee to speak good concerning them, to cause thy wrath to turn away from them.
024	JER	018	021	Therefore give up their children to the famine, and let their life ebb out by means of the sword; and let their wives be bereaved of their children, and widows; and let their men be slain by death; their young men smitten by the sword in the battle.
024	JER	018	022	Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou bringest a troop over them suddenly; for they have dug a pit to catch me, and laid concealed snares for my feet.
024	JER	018	023	Yet thou, Lord, knowest well all their counsel against me to [procure my] death: forgive not their iniquity, and let their sin not be blotted out from before thee; but let them be brought to stumbling before thee; in the time of thy anger deal thus with them.
024	JER	019	001	Thus said the Lord, Go and buy a bottle from a maker of earthenware, and [take] some of the elders of the people, and of the elders of the priests;
024	JER	019	002	And go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by the entry of the gate Charsith, and proclaim there the words that I will speak unto thee.
024	JER	019	003	And say, Hear ye the word of the Lord, O kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem, Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will bring evil over this place, so that the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.
024	JER	019	004	For the reason that they have forsaken me, and have defiled this place, and have burnt incense in it unto other gods, which they had not known, either they or their fathers, or the kings of Judah, and have filled this place with the blood of innocents;
024	JER	019	005	And they have built the high-places of Ba'al, to burn their sons with fire as burnt-offerings unto Ba'al, which I had not commanded, nor spoken, and which had not come into my mind:
024	JER	019	006	Therefore, behold, days are coming, saith the Lord, that this place shall no more be called The Thopheth, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but, The valley of slaughter.
024	JER	019	007	And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hand of those that seek their life: and I will give their carcasses as food unto the fowls of the heaven, and unto the beasts of the earth.
024	JER	019	008	And I will render this city desolate, and an [object of] derision: every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all its plagues.
024	JER	019	009	And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they shall eat every one the flesh of his associate, in the siege and straitness, wherewith their enemies, and those that seek their life, shall distress them.
024	JER	019	010	Then shalt thou break the bottle before the eyes of the men that are going with thee.
024	JER	019	011	And thou shalt say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, In this manner will I break this people and this city, as one breaketh a potter's vessel, that cannot be restored again; and in Thopheth shall they bury, for want of room to bury.
024	JER	019	012	Thus will I do unto this place, saith the Lord, and to its inhabitants, and to make this city as Thopheth:
024	JER	019	013	And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, which are unclean, shall become as the place of the Thopheth, with all the houses upon the roofs of which they have burnt incense to all the host of heaven, and have poured out drink-offerings to other gods.
024	JER	019	014	Then came Jeremiah from the Thopheth, whither the Lord had sent him to prophesy; and he placed himself in the court of the house of the Lord; and said to all the people,
024	JER	019	015	Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will bring upon this city and upon all its towns all the evil that I have spoken against it; because they have hardened their neck, so as not to hear my words.
024	JER	020	001	But when Pashchur the son of Immer the priest, who was chief superintendent in the house of the Lord, heard Jeremiah prophesying these words:
024	JER	020	002	Then smote Pashchur Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of Benjamin, which was in the house of the Lord.
024	JER	020	003	And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashchur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. And Jeremiah said unto him, Not Pashchur [Fulness of Freedom] hath the Lord called thy name, but Magor-missabib [Terror all around].
024	JER	020	004	For thus hath said the Lord, Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends; and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thy eyes shall see it; and all Judah will I give into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall lead them into exile to Babylon, and shall smite them with the sword.
024	JER	020	005	And I will give up all the wealth of this city, and all its acquisitions, and all its precious things; and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, who shall plunder them, and take them and carry them away to Babylon.
024	JER	020	006	And thou, Pashchur, and all the inhabitants of thy house, shall go into captivity; and to Babylon shalt thou come, and there thou shalt die, and there shalt thou be buried, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied with falsehood.
024	JER	020	007	Thou didst persuade me, O Lord, and I was persuaded; thou laidst thy [hand] strongly on me, and didst prevail: I am laughed at all the time, every one mocketh me.
024	JER	020	008	For as often as I speak must I cry out, violence and wasting must I proclaim; because the word of the Lord is become unto me a disgrace, and a derision, all the time.
024	JER	020	009	And I thought, I will not make mention of him, and I will not speak any more in his name. But it became in my heart as a burning fire enclosed within my bones, and I was weary with enduring, and I could not overcome it.
024	JER	020	010	For I heard the defaming of many, angry assemblies on every side, “Tell, and we will tell of him.” All the men who ought to seek my welfare, watch for my fall; saying, “Peradventure he may he enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and we will then take our revenge on him.”
024	JER	020	011	But the Lord is with me as a mighty powerful one; therefore my persecutors will stumble, and they will not prevail: they will be greatly ashamed, for they will not prosper; [it is] an everlasting confusion which will never be forgotten.
024	JER	020	012	But, O Lord of hosts, that probest the righteous, seest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them; for unto thee have I laid open my cause.
024	JER	020	013	Sing unto the Lord, praise ye the Lord; for he hath delivered the soul of the needy from the hand of evil-doers.
024	JER	020	014	Cursed be the day whereon I was born: the day on which my mother bore me shall not be blessed.
024	JER	020	015	Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A man-child is born unto thee. How very glad did he make him!
024	JER	020	016	And may that same man become like the cities which the Lord overthrew, and bethought himself not; and may he hear a cry of anguish in the morning, and a tumultuous noise at noontide;
024	JER	020	017	Because I was not slain [as I escaped] from the womb; or that my mother might have become unto me my grave, and her womb have been affected with a perpetual pregnancy.
024	JER	020	018	Wherefore was this that I came forth out of the womb to see trouble and sorrow, that my days should pass away in shame?
024	JER	021	001	The word which came unto Jeremiah from the Lord, when king Zedekiah sent unto him Pashchur the son of Malkiyah, and Zephanyah the son of Ma'asseyah the priest, saying,
024	JER	021	002	Inquire, I pray thee, in our behalf of the Lord; for Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon maketh war against us; peradventure the Lord will deal with us according to all his wondrous deeds, so that he may withdraw from us.
024	JER	021	003	Then said Jeremiah unto them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah:
024	JER	021	004	Thus hath said the Lord the God of Israel, Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, wherewith ye fight against the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans, who besiege you without the walls, and I will assemble them into the midst of this city.
024	JER	021	005	And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, and in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath.
024	JER	021	006	And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast: of a great pestilence shall they die.
024	JER	021	007	And afterward, saith the Lord, will I give up Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, and those that are left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek their life: and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword; he will not spare them, nor have pity, nor have mercy.
024	JER	021	008	And unto this people shalt thou say, Thus hath said the Lord, Behold, I set before you the way of life, and the way of death.
024	JER	021	009	He that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword, or by the famine, or by the pestilence; but he that goeth out, and runneth away to the Chaldeans that besiege you, shall remain alive, and his life shall be unto him as a booty.
024	JER	021	010	For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good, saith the Lord: into the hand of the king of Babylon shall it be given up, and he will burn it with fire.
024	JER	021	011	And to the house of the king of Judah [say], Hear ye the word of the Lord:
024	JER	021	012	O house of David, thus hath said the Lord, Exercise justice on [every] morning, and deliver him that is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor; lest my fury go forth like fire, and burn so that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.
024	JER	021	013	Behold, I am against thee, O inhabitress of the valley, [about] the rock of the plain, saith the Lord; who say, Who shall descend down against us? or who shall enter into our habitations?
024	JER	021	014	But I will inflict punishment on you according to the fruit of your doings, saith the Lord: and I will kindle a fire in its forest, and it shall devour all its environs.
024	JER	022	001	Thus said the Lord, Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word;
024	JER	022	002	And thou shalt say, Hear the word of the Lord, O king of Judah, that sittest upon the throne of David, thou, and thy servants, and thy people that enter in by these gates:
024	JER	022	003	Thus hath said the Lord, Execute ye justice and righteousness, and deliver him that is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor; and the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow shall ye not oppress, and do them no violence, and shed no innocent blood in this place.
024	JER	022	004	For if ye indeed will do this thing, then shall enter in through the gates of this house kings sitting after David upon his throne, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people.
024	JER	022	005	But if ye will not hear these words, then do I swear by myself, saith the Lord, that this house shall become a ruin.
024	JER	022	006	For thus hath said the Lord concerning the house of the king of Judah, A Gil'ad [though] thou art unto me, a summit of the Lebanon: yet I will surely change thee into a wilderness, cities which are not inhabited.
024	JER	022	007	And I will make ready against thee destroyers, every one with his weapons: and they shall cut down the choice of thy cedars, and cast them into the fire.
024	JER	022	008	And [when] many nations [then] pass by this city, they will say every man to his neighbor, Wherefore hath the Lord done the like unto this great city?
024	JER	022	009	Then shall they say, Because they had forsaken the covenant of the Lord their God, and bowed down unto other gods, and served them.
024	JER	022	010	Weep not for the dead, and do not bemoan him: weep sorely for him that goeth away; for he shall never return any more, and see the land of his birth.
024	JER	022	011	For thus hath said the Lord respecting Shallum the son of Josiah the king of Judah, who reigneth in the place of Josiah his father, who is gone forth out of this place, He shall never return thither any more;
024	JER	022	012	But in the place whither they have led him into exile, there shall he die; but this land shall he not see any more.
024	JER	022	013	Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by injustice; that maketh his neighbor work without wages, and giveth him not the reward for his labor;
024	JER	022	014	That saith, I will build me a roomy house, and ample chambers, and cutteth himself out windows, and ceileth it with cedar, and painteth it with colors.
024	JER	022	015	Shalt thou reign, because thou strivest to excel with cedar buildings? behold, thy father ate and drank, but he executed justice and righteousness: then was it well with him!
024	JER	022	016	He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then was it well: is not this the proper knowledge of me? saith the Lord.
024	JER	022	017	But thy eyes and thy heart are directed on nothing but upon thy own gain, and upon innocent blood to shed it, and upon oppression, and upon extortion, to practise them.
024	JER	022	018	Therefore thus hath said the Lord concerning Jehoyakim the son of Josiah the king of Judah, They shall not lament for him, with, “Woe, my brother!” and, “Woe, sister!” they shall not lament for him, with “Woe, lord!” and, “Woe, to his glory!”
024	JER	022	019	With the burial of an ass shall he be buried, dragged about and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.
024	JER	022	020	Ascend the Lebanon, and cry aloud; and let thy voice resound in Bashan; and cry aloud from 'Aharim; for crushed are all thy lovers.
024	JER	022	021	I spoke unto thee in thy prosperity; but thou saidst, I will not hear. This hath been thy manner from thy very youth, that thou didst not hearken to my voice.
024	JER	022	022	The wind shall scatter abroad all thy shepherds, and thy lovers shall go into captivity: surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded because of all thy wickedness.
024	JER	022	023	O inhabitress of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how full of grace wilt thou be! when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a woman in travail!
024	JER	022	024	As I live, saith the Lord, though Conyahu the son of Jehoyakim the king of Judah were a signet upon my right hand, yet for a surety would I thence pluck thee;
024	JER	022	025	And I will give thee into the hand of those that seek thy life, and into the hand of those of whom thou art afraid, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.
024	JER	022	026	And I will hurl thee out, and thy mother that hath born thee, into another country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye die.
024	JER	022	027	But to the land whitherward they direct their soul to return, thither shall they not return.
024	JER	022	028	Is this man Conyahu a despised broken image? or a vessel without value? wherefore are they hurled out, he and his seed, and are cast forth into a land which they know not?
024	JER	022	029	O land, land, land! hear the word of the Lord.
024	JER	022	030	Thus hath said the Lord, Write ye down this man as childless, as a man that shall not prosper in his days; for no man of his seed shall succeed to sit upon the throne of David, and to rule any more in Judah.
024	JER	023	001	Woe unto the shepherds that destroy and scatter the flocks of my pasture! saith the Lord.
024	JER	023	002	Therefore thus hath said the Lord the God of Israel concerning the shepherds that feed my people, Ye have scattered my flocks, and driven them away, and have not taken care of them: now, behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings, saith the Lord.
024	JER	023	003	And I will indeed gather the remnant of my flock together out of all the countries whither I have driven them; and I will bring them back again to their folds: and they shall be fruitful and multiply.
024	JER	023	004	And I will raise up over them shepherds who shall feed them: and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, and none of them shall be missing, saith the Lord.
024	JER	023	005	Behold, days are coming, saith the Lord, when I will raise up unto David a righteous sprout, and he shall reign as king, and prosper, and he shall execute justice and righteousness on the earth.
024	JER	023	006	In his days shall Judah be helped, and Israel shall dwell in safety: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, The Lord is our righteousness.
024	JER	023	007	Therefore, behold, days are coming, saith the Lord, when they shall no more say, As the Lord liveth, who hath brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;
024	JER	023	008	But, As the Lord liveth, who hath brought up and who hath led forth the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and out of all countries whither I had driven them: and they shall dwell in their own land.
024	JER	023	009	To the prophets—Broken is my heart within me; all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a person whom wine hath overcome, because of the Lord, and because of his holy words.
024	JER	023	010	For of adulterers is the land full; for because of false swearing mourneth the land, dried up are the pastures in the wilderness; because their course was for evil, and their strength was for injustice.
024	JER	023	011	For both prophet and priest are hypocrites: yea, in my own house have I found their wickedness, saith the Lord.
024	JER	023	012	Therefore shall their way be unto them as slippery ways in the darkness; they shall be pushed forward, and fall thereon; for I will bring upon them evil, the year of their punishment, saith the Lord.
024	JER	023	013	And on the prophets of Samaria have I seen absurdity: they prophesied by Ba'al, and misled my people Israel.
024	JER	023	014	But on the prophets of Jerusalem have I seen a horrible thing; they commit adultery, and walk in falsehood; and they strengthen the hands of evil-doers, so that not one of these doth return from his wickedness: they are become unto me all of them as Sodom, and its inhabitants as Gomorrah.
024	JER	023	015	Therefore thus hath said the Lord of hosts concerning the prophets, Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink poison-water; for from the prophets of Jerusalem is hypocrisy gone forth over all the land.
024	JER	023	016	Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you, they bring you unto vanity: a vision of their own heart do they ever speak, not out of the mouth of the Lord.
024	JER	023	017	They say indeed unto those that incense me, The Lord hath spoken, Peace shall ye have; and unto every one that walketh in the stubbornness of his own heart, they said, There shall come no evil upon you.
024	JER	023	018	For who hath stood in the secret counsel of the Lord, that he could perceive and hear his word? who hath listened to his word and heard it?
024	JER	023	019	Behold, the storm-wind of the Lord is gone forth in fury, yea, a whirling storm: upon the head of the wicked shall it fall grievously.
024	JER	023	020	The anger of the Lord will not return, until he have executed, and until he have fulfilled the purposes of his heart: in the end of days shall ye understand this fully.
024	JER	023	021	I had not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I had not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.
024	JER	023	022	But if they had stood in my secret counsel, they should have announced my words to my people, and have caused them to turn back from their evil way, and from the wrongfulness of their doings.
024	JER	023	023	Am I a God for those near at hand, saith the Lord, and not a God for those who are afar off?
024	JER	023	024	If a man should hide himself in secret places should I not then see him? saith the Lord. Do I not fill the heavens and the earth? saith the Lord.
024	JER	023	025	I have heard what the prophets have said, that prophesy falsely in my name, saying, I have dreamt, I have dreamt.
024	JER	023	026	How long shall it be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy falsehood? yea, the prophets of the deceit of their own heart, —
024	JER	023	027	[How long] do they think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they relate every man to his neighbor, as their fathers forgot my name for the sake of Ba'al?
024	JER	023	028	The prophet that hath had a dream, let him relate his dream; and he that hath received my word, let him speak my word of truth. What hath the straw to do with the corn? saith the Lord.
024	JER	023	029	Is not thus my word, like the fire? saith the Lord, and like a hammer that shivereth the rock?
024	JER	023	030	Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, saith the Lord, that steal my words every one from his neighbor.
024	JER	023	031	Behold, I am against the prophets, saith the Lord, that use their own word, and say, [The Lord] saith.
024	JER	023	032	Behold, I am against those that prophesy with false dreams, saith the Lord, and do relate them, and mislead my people by their falsehoods, and by their vain boasting: while I have not sent them, nor commanded them; and they cannot bring the least profit to this people, saith the Lord.
024	JER	023	033	And if this people, or the prophet, or a priest, should ask thee, saying, What is the message of the Lord? then shalt thou say unto them, Because of this “What is the message?” will I even cast you off, saith the Lord.
024	JER	023	034	And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that will say, “A message of the Lord,” I will even inflict punishment on that man and on his house.
024	JER	023	035	Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbor, and every one to his brother, What hath the Lord answered? and, What hath the Lord spoken?
024	JER	023	036	But “A message of the Lord” shall ye not mention any more; for the message cometh indeed to the man of his [prophetic] word; but ye pervert the words of the living God, of the Lord of hosts our God.
024	JER	023	037	Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath the Lord answered thee? and, What hath the Lord spoken?
024	JER	023	038	But if ye will say, “A message of the Lord,” then thus saith the Lord, Because ye say this word, “A message of the Lord,” and I have sent unto you, saying, Ye shall not say, “A message of the Lord:”
024	JER	023	039	Therefore, behold, I am here, and I will tear you completely away, and I will cast you off, and the city that I have given to you and to your fathers, out of my presence;
024	JER	023	040	And I will lay upon you an everlasting disgrace, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.
024	JER	024	001	The Lord caused me to see, and, behold, there were two baskets of figs placed before the temple of the Lord, after Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon had carried away into exile Yechonyahu the son of Yehoyakim the king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the carpenters and the locksmiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.
024	JER	024	002	The one basket [had] very good figs, like the figs that are first ripe: and the other basket [had] very bad figs, which could not be eaten, from being so bad.
024	JER	024	003	Then said the Lord unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs: the good figs, are very good; and the bad ones, are very bad, which cannot be eaten, from being so bad.
024	JER	024	004	And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
024	JER	024	005	Thus hath said the Lord, the God of Israel, Like these good figs, so will I acknowledge the exiles of Judah, whom I have sent away from this place into the land of the Chaldeans, for good.
024	JER	024	006	And I will set my eye upon them for good, and I will cause them to return again to this land; and I will build them up, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.
024	JER	024	007	And I will give them a heart to know me, that I am the Lord: and they shall be unto me for a people, and I will be unto them for God! for they will return unto me with all their heart.
024	JER	024	008	And like the bad figs, which cannot be eaten, from being so bad, surely thus hath said the Lord, So I will render Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and those that dwell in the land of Egypt;
024	JER	024	009	And I will make them a horror because of [their] mishaps unto all the kingdoms of the earth, a disgrace and a proverb, a byword and a curse, in all the places whither I will drive them.
024	JER	024	010	And I will send out against them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, till they be destroyed from off the land that I had given unto them and to their fathers.
024	JER	025	001	The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoyakim the son of Josiah the king of Judah, which is the first year of Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon;
024	JER	025	002	Which Jeremiah the prophet spoke concerning all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying,
024	JER	025	003	From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon the king of Judah, even until this day, that is now three and twenty years, the word of the Lord hath come unto me, and I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye have not hearkened.
024	JER	025	004	And the Lord hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets, making [them] rise early and sending [them]; but ye have not hearkened, and have not inclined your ear to hear.
024	JER	025	005	They said, O do turn away every one from his evil way, and from the wrongfulness of your doings; and ye shall remain in the land that the Lord hath given unto you and to your fathers, for from eternity to eternity;
024	JER	025	006	And go not after other gods to serve them, and to bow down to them, and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands; and I will not injure you.
024	JER	025	007	Yet have ye not hearkened unto me, saith the Lord: in order that ye might provoke me to anger with the works of your own hands to your own injury.
024	JER	025	008	Therefore thus hath said the Lord of hosts, Because ye have not hearkened to my words:
024	JER	025	009	Behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith the Lord, and to Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and I will bring them over this land, and over its inhabitants, and over all these nations round about, and I will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and a derision, and perpetual ruins.
024	JER	025	010	And I will banish from them the voice of gladness, and the voice of joy, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the mill, and the light of the lamp.
024	JER	025	011	And this whole land shall become a ruin and an [object of] astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.
024	JER	025	012	And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are completed, that I will visit on the king of Babylon, and on that nation, saith the Lord, their iniquity, and on the land of the Chaldeans, and will change it into perpetual desolations.
024	JER	025	013	And I will bring over that land all my words which I have spoken concerning it, all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah hath prophesied concerning all the nations.
024	JER	025	014	For when many nations and great kings shall have made them also serve: I will then recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the work of their own hands.
024	JER	025	015	For thus hath said the Lord the God of Israel unto me, Take the cup of the wine of this fury out of my hand, and cause all the nations to whom I send thee to drink it.
024	JER	025	016	And they shall drink, and reel about, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them.
024	JER	025	017	And I took the cup out of the hand of the Lord, and caused to drink all the nations, unto whom the Lord had sent me:
024	JER	025	018	Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and its kings, and its princes, to make them a ruin, an astonishment, a derision, and a curse; as it is this day;
024	JER	025	019	Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his people;
024	JER	025	020	And all the confederated nations, and all the kings of the land of 'Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Gazzah, and 'Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod;
024	JER	025	021	Edom, and Moab, and the children of 'Ammon;
024	JER	025	022	And all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the isle which is beyond the sea;
024	JER	025	023	Dedan, and Thema, and Buz, and all those that have their hair cut round;
024	JER	025	024	And all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the confederated nations that dwell in the wilderness;
024	JER	025	025	And all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of 'Elam, and all the kings of Media;
024	JER	025	026	And all the kings of the north, that are far and that are near, one with another, and all the kingdoms of the world, which are upon the face of the earth; and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.
024	JER	025	027	And thou shalt say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Drink ye, and become drunken, and vomit, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword, which I am sending among you.
024	JER	025	028	And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup of thy hand to drink, that thou shalt say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, Ye must certainly drink;
024	JER	025	029	For lo, on the city which is called by my name, I begin to inflict evil, and ye will remain utterly unpunished? Ye shall not remain unpunished; for a sword am I calling up over all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the Lord of hosts.
024	JER	025	030	But thou, do thou prophesy concerning them all these words, and say unto them, The Lord will cry aloud from on high, and from his holy habitation will he send forth his voice; he will cry out very loudly over his habitation; the vintner's call, as they that tread out the grapes, will he lift up against all the inhabitants of the earth.
024	JER	025	031	A tumultuous noise cometh even to the ends of the earth; for the Lord hath a controversy with the nations, he holdeth judgment over all flesh: the wicked, —these he giveth up to the sword, saith the Lord.
024	JER	025	032	Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, Behold, evil goeth forth from nation to nation, and a great storm-wind waketh up from the farthest ends of the earth.
024	JER	025	033	And the slain of the Lord shall be on that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, nor gathered up, nor buried; they shall be as dung upon the surface of the ground.
024	JER	025	034	Wail, ye shepherds, and cry; and roll yourselves about [in the dust], ye leaders of the flocks; for full are your days for you to be slaughtered, and I will scatter you; and you shall fall like a costly vessel.
024	JER	025	035	And lost shall be the place of refuge for the shepherds, and the escape for the leaders of the flocks to escape.
024	JER	025	036	There is the voice of the cry of anguish of the shepherds, and the wailing of the leaders of the flocks; for the Lord hath devastated their pasture.
024	JER	025	037	And in silent desolation lie the pasture-lands of peace, because of the fierceness of the anger of the Lord.
024	JER	025	038	He hath forsaken his covert, like the young lion; for their land is become desolate, because of the fierceness of the wasting [sword], and because of the fierceness of his anger.
024	JER	026	001	In the beginning of the reign of Jehoyakim the son of Josiah the king of Judah came this word from the Lord, saying,
024	JER	026	002	Thus hath said the Lord, Place thyself in the court of the house of the Lord, and speak against all of the cities of Judah, who come to prostrate themselves in the house of the Lord, all the words that I have commanded thee to speak unto them: omit not a word [thereof];
024	JER	026	003	Perhaps it be that they will hearken, and return every man from his evil way, that I may bethink me of the evil, which I purpose to do unto them, because of the wrongfulness of their doings.
024	JER	026	004	And thou shalt say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord, if ye will not hearken unto me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you,
024	JER	026	005	To hearken unto the words of my servants the prophets, whom I send unto you, yea, making them rise up early, and sending them, while ye have not hearkened:
024	JER	026	006	Then will I render this house like Shiloh, and this city will I render a curse unto all the nations of the earth.
024	JER	026	007	And the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the Lord:
024	JER	026	008	And it came to pass, when Jeremiah had finished speaking all that the Lord had commanded [him] to speak unto all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people seized on him, saying, Thou shalt surely die.
024	JER	026	009	Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the Lord, saying, Like Shiloh shall this house be, and this city shall be ruined, [left] without an inhabitant? And all the people assembled themselves against Jeremiah in the house of the Lord.
024	JER	026	010	But when the princes of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king's house unto the house of the Lord, and sat down at the entrance of the new gate of the Lord's house.
024	JER	026	011	Then said the priests and the prophets unto the princes and unto all the people, as followeth, This man deserveth the punishment of death; for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your own ears.
024	JER	026	012	Then said Jeremiah unto all the princes and unto all the people, as followeth, The Lord hath sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard.
024	JER	026	013	But now amend your ways and your doings, and hearken to the voice of the Lord your God: and the Lord will bethink him of the evil that he hath spoken against you.
024	JER	026	014	As for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as seemeth good and just in your eyes.
024	JER	026	015	But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye will surely place [the guilt of] innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon its inhabitants; for in truth hath the Lord sent me unto you to speak in your ears all these words.
024	JER	026	016	Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets, This man is not deserving the punishment of death; for in the name of the Lord our God hath he spoken unto us.
024	JER	026	017	And then rose up certain men of the elders of the land, and said to all the assembly of the people, as followeth,
024	JER	026	018	Michah the Morashthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah the king of Judah. and said to all the people of Judah, as followeth, Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, Zion shall be ploughed up like a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps of ruins, and the mountain of the house, woody high-places.
024	JER	026	019	Did Hezekiah the king of Judah and all Judah attempt to put him to death? behold, he did fear the Lord, and besought the Lord, and the Lord bethought him of the evil which he had spoken against them. And shall we bring a great wickedness on our souls?
024	JER	026	020	And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the Lord, Uriyah the son of Shema'yahu of Kiryath-ye'arim, who prophesied against this city and against this land in accordance with all the words of Jeremiah;
024	JER	026	021	And when king Jehoyakim, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death; but when Uriyahu heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and arrived in Egypt;
024	JER	026	022	But king Jehoyakim sent some men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the son of 'Achbor, and some men with him into Egypt:
024	JER	026	023	And they fetched Uriyahu out of Egypt, and brought him unto king Jehoyakim, who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body upon the graves of the common people.
024	JER	026	024	But the hand of Achikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, so as not to give him up into the hand of the people to put him to death.
024	JER	027	001	In the beginning of the reign of Jehoyakim the son of Josiah the king of Judah came this word unto Jeremiah from the Lord, saying,
024	JER	027	002	Thus said the Lord to me, Make for thyself bands and yoke-bars, and put them around thy neck,
024	JER	027	003	And send such to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the children of 'Ammon, and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Zidon, by means of the messengers who come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah the king of Judah;
024	JER	027	004	And thou shalt charge them unto their masters, saying, Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Thus shall ye say unto your masters,
024	JER	027	005	It is I who have made the earth, the men, and the beasts that are upon the face of the earth, by my great power and by my outstretched arm, and I have given it unto the one who seemeth proper in my eyes.
024	JER	027	006	And now it is I who have given all these countries into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and also the beasts of the field have I given him to serve him.
024	JER	027	007	And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's son, until the time of his land is also come in its turn: when many nations and great kings shall make it serve.
024	JER	027	008	And it shall come to pass, that the nation and the kingdom which will not serve him, Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and that will not put its neck in the yoke of the king of Babylon, —even that nation will I punish with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, saith the Lord, until I have made an end of them by his hand.
024	JER	027	009	But do ye not hearken to your prophets, and to your diviners, and to your dreamers, and to your enchanters, and to your sorcerers, who speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon;
024	JER	027	010	For falsehood do they prophesy unto you, in order to remove you far from your land; and that I might drive you out, and that ye might perish.
024	JER	027	011	But the nation that will bring its neck into the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, —that one will I then let remain quietly in its own land, saith the Lord: and it shall till it, and dwell therein.
024	JER	027	012	And unto Zedekiah the king of Judah did I speak in accordance with all these words, saying, Bring your neck into the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, that ye may live.
024	JER	027	013	Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by pestilence, as the Lord hath spoken concerning the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?
024	JER	027	014	And do ye not hearken unto the words of the prophets that say unto you, as followeth, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon; for a falsehood do they prophesy unto you.
024	JER	027	015	For I have not sent them, saith the Lord, yet they prophesy in my name falsely: in order that I might drive you out, and that ye might perish, ye, and the prophets that prophesy unto you.
024	JER	027	016	And unto the priests and unto all this people did I speak, saying, Thus hath said the Lord, Do not hearken to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the house of the Lord shall be brought again from Babylon now speedily; for a falsehood do they prophesy unto you.
024	JER	027	017	Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, that ye may live: wherefore should this city become a ruin?
024	JER	027	018	And if they be prophets, and if the word of the Lord be with them, let them now make intercession with the Lord of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of the Lord, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, may not be carried to Babylon.
024	JER	027	019	For thus hath said the Lord of hosts of the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that are left in this city,
024	JER	027	020	Which Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon did not take away, when he carried away into exile Jechonyah the son of Jehoyakim the king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon, with all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;
024	JER	027	021	[Yea] for thus hath said the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that are left in the house of the Lord, and in the house of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem,
024	JER	027	022	Unto Babylon shall they be carried, and there shall they remain until the day that I think of them, saith the Lord, when I will bring them up, and restore them to this place.
024	JER	028	001	And it came to pass in the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah the king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, that there said unto me Chananyah the son of 'Azzur the prophet, who was from Gib'on, in the house of the Lord, before the eyes of the priests, and of all the people, as followeth,
024	JER	028	002	Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon;
024	JER	028	003	Within yet two years' time will I cause to be brought back unto this place all the vessels of the house of the Lord, which Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon hath taken away from this place, and which he hath carried to Babylon:
024	JER	028	004	And Jechonyah the son of Jehoyakim the king of Judah, and all the exiles of Judah that are gone to Babylon, will I cause to return to this place, saith the Lord; for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.
024	JER	028	005	Then said Jeremiah the prophet unto Chananyah the prophet before the eyes of the priests, and before the eyes of all the people that stood in the house of the Lord,
024	JER	028	006	Yea, then said Jeremiah the prophet, Amen, may the Lord do so: may the Lord fulfill thy words which thou hast prophesied, to cause the vessels of the Lord's house, and all that have been carried into exile, to be brought back from Babylon unto this place.
024	JER	028	007	Nevertheless hear thou now this word which I speak before thy ears, and before the ears of all the people:
024	JER	028	008	The prophets that have been before me and before thee from olden times prophesied both concerning many countries, and against great kingdoms, respecting war, and respecting evil, and respecting pestilence.
024	JER	028	009	The prophet who prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet doth come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, [as the one] whom the Lord hath sent in truth.
024	JER	028	010	Then took Chananyah the prophet the yoke-bar from off the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, and broke it.
024	JER	028	011	And Chananyah said before the eyes of all the people, as followeth, Thus hath said the Lord, Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon within two years' time from the neck of all the nations. And Jeremiah the prophet went his way.
024	JER	028	012	Then came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah, after Chananyah the prophet had broken the yoke-bar from off the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
024	JER	028	013	Go and say unto Chananyah as followeth, Thus hath said the Lord, Yoke-bars of wood hast thou broken; but thou shalt make in their stead yoke-bars of iron.
024	JER	028	014	For thus hath said the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, A yoke of iron have I placed upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon; and they shall work for him: and also the beasts of the field have I given him.
024	JER	028	015	Then said Jeremiah the prophet unto Chananyah the prophet, Hear now, Chananyah, The Lord did not send thee; but thou hast caused this people to trust on a falsehood.
024	JER	028	016	Therefore thus hath said the Lord, Behold, I will send thee away from off the face of the earth: this year shalt thou die, because thou hast spoken rebellion against the Lord.
024	JER	028	017	So Chananyah the prophet died in that same year, in the seventh month.
024	JER	029	001	And these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders of the exiles, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon;
024	JER	029	002	(After king Jechonyah and the queen-mother, and the court-officers, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and the locksmiths, were departed from Jerusalem;)
024	JER	029	003	By the hand of El'assah the son of Shaphan, and Gemaryah the son of Chilkiyah, [whom Zedekiah the king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon,] saying,
024	JER	029	004	Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all the exiles, whom I have caused to be carried into exile from Jerusalem unto Babylon,
024	JER	029	005	Build ye houses, and dwell therein; and plant gardens, and eat their fruit;
024	JER	029	006	Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; that ye may multiply there, and not be diminished.
024	JER	029	007	And seek the welfare of the city whither I have banished you, and pray in its behalf unto the Lord; for in its welfare shall ye fare well.
024	JER	029	008	For thus hath said the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Let not your prophets, that are in the midst of you, and your diviners, deceive you, and do not hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamt;
024	JER	029	009	For with falsehood do they prophesy unto you in my name: I have not sent them, saith the Lord.
024	JER	029	010	For thus hath said the Lord, Because only after the accomplishment of seventy years for Babylon, will I visit you, and fulfill respecting you my good word, in causing you to return to this place.
024	JER	029	011	For I alone know the thoughts that I entertain respecting you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you a [happy] future and hope.
024	JER	029	012	And you will call upon me, and ye will go and will pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you.
024	JER	029	013	And ye will seek me, and shall find me, for ye will search for me with all your heart.
024	JER	029	014	And I will be found of you, saith the Lord; and I will bring back your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places whither I have driven you, saith the Lord; and I will cause you to return unto the place whence I have banished you.
024	JER	029	015	Because ye have said, The Lord hath raised us up prophets in Babylon.
024	JER	029	016	But thus hath said the Lord concerning the king that sitteth upon the throne of David, and concerning all the people that dwell in this city, your brethren that are not gone forth with you into exile;
024	JER	029	017	Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, Behold, I will send out against them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence; and I will render them like the detestable figs, that cannot be eaten, from being so bad.
024	JER	029	018	And I will pursue after them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will make them a horror unto all the kingdoms of the earth, a curse, and an astonishment, and a derision, and a disgrace, among all the nations whither I have driven them;
024	JER	029	019	For the reason that they have not hearkened to my words, saith the Lord, since I sent unto them my servants the prophets, causing them to rise up early and sending them; but ye would not hear, saith the Lord.
024	JER	029	020	But ye—hear ye the word of the Lord, all ye exiles whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon.
024	JER	029	021	Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Achab the son of Kolayah, and of Zedekiah the son of Ma'asseyah, who prophesy unto you in my name falsehood, Behold, I will give them up into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon: and he shall smite them before your eyes.
024	JER	029	022	And a curse shall be derived from them for all the exiles of Judah who are in Babylon, saying, “May the Lord make thee like Zedekiah and like Achab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;”
024	JER	029	023	Because they have done scandalous deeds in Israel, and have committed adultery with the wives of their neighbors, and have spoken in my name falsehood, which I had not commanded them; whereas I am the one that know, and am the witness, saith the Lord.
024	JER	029	024	And to Shema'yahu the Nechelamite shalt thou say, as followeth,
024	JER	029	025	Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou hast sent in thy name letters unto all the people that are at Jerusalem, and to Zephanyah the son of Ma'asseyah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,
024	JER	029	026	The Lord hath appointed thee priest in the place of Jehoyada' the priest, that ye should be superintendents in the house of the Lord, for every man that is mad, and that prophesieth, that thou shouldst put him in the stocks, and in prison:
024	JER	029	027	And now, why hast thou not rebuked Jeremiah of 'Anathoth, who prophesieth to you?
024	JER	029	028	For the reason that he hath sent unto us to Babylon saying, It will last a long time: build ye houses, and dwell therein; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit thereof.
024	JER	029	029	And Zephanyah the priest read the letter before the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.
024	JER	029	030	Then came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah, saying,
024	JER	029	031	Send to all the exiles, saying, Thus hath said the Lord concerning Shema'yah the Nechlamite, Whereas Shema'yah hath prophesied unto you, while I have not sent him, and he hath caused you to rely on a falsehood:
024	JER	029	032	Therefore thus hath said the Lord, Behold, I will inflict punishment on Shema'yah the Nechlamite, and on his seed; he shall not have a man to dwell in the midst of this people; and he shall not behold the good that I am doing for my people, saith the Lord; because he hath spoken revolt against the Lord.
024	JER	030	001	The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying,
024	JER	030	002	Thus hath said the Lord the God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book.
024	JER	030	003	For, behold, days are coming, saith the Lord, when I will bring back again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the Lord; and I will cause them to return to the land that I have given to their fathers, and they shall possess it.
024	JER	030	004	And these are the words that the Lord spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah;
024	JER	030	005	For thus hath said the Lord, A voice of terror have we heard, dread, and no peace.
024	JER	030	006	Ask ye now, and see whether a male doth give birth to a child? wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in giving birth? and why are all faces turned pale?
024	JER	030	007	Alas, for that day is great, there is none like it; and a time of distress it is unto Jacob; yet out of it shall he be saved.
024	JER	030	008	And it shall come to pass on that day, saith the Lord of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and thy bands will I burst asunder; and strangers shall not make him serve any more;
024	JER	030	009	But they shall serve the Lord their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.
024	JER	030	010	And thou—do not fear, O my servant Jacob, saith the Lord; and be not dismayed, O Israel; for, behold, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity: and Jacob shall return, and shall be at rest, and be secure, with none to terrify him.
024	JER	030	011	For with thee am I, saith the Lord, to save thee: though I make a full end of all the nations whither I have scattered thee, yet of thee will I not make a full end; but I will correct thee in moderation, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished.
024	JER	030	012	For thus hath said the Lord, Incurable is thy bruise, and painful, thy wound.
024	JER	030	013	There is no one to plead thy cause, to bind up [thy wound]: useful remedies there are none for thee.
024	JER	030	014	All thy lovers have forgotten thee; thee they seek not; for with the blow of an enemy have I smitten thee, with cruel chastisement, for the multitude of thy iniquity, because thy sins were so numerous.
024	JER	030	015	Why wilt thou cry out because of thy breach? for thy pain which is incurable? because of the multitude of thy iniquity, because thy sins were so numerous, have I done these things unto thee.
024	JER	030	016	Nevertheless all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thy adversaries, all of them, shall go into captivity; and they that plunder thee shall be [given up] to plunder, and all that prey upon thee will I give up for a prey.
024	JER	030	017	For I will place a healing plaster on thy bruise, and of thy wounds will I cure thee, saith the Lord; because they called thee “an Outcast.” “This is Zion, whom no one seeketh after.”
024	JER	030	018	Thus hath said the Lord, Behold, I will bring back again the captivity of the tents of Jacob, and on his dwelling-places will I have mercy; and the city shall be rebuilt upon her own heap of ruins, and the palace shall be inhabited after its [ancient] manner.
024	JER	030	019	And there shall proceed out of them thanksgiving, and the voice of those that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be diminished; I will also make them numerous, and they shall not be made few in number.
024	JER	030	020	And their children shall be as aforetimes, and their congregation shall be firmly established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them.
024	JER	030	021	And their leader shall be of themselves, and their ruler shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me; for who is this that will venture of his own heart to approach unto me? saith the Lord.
024	JER	030	022	And ye shall be unto me for a people, and I will be unto you for a God.
024	JER	030	023	Behold, the storm-wind of the Lord goeth forth with fury, an abiding storm-wind: upon the head of the wicked shall it fall.
024	JER	030	024	The fierceness of the anger of the Lord will not turn back, until he have done, and until he have fulfilled the purposes of his heart: in the latter days shall ye understand this.
024	JER	031	001	At the same time, saith the Lord, will I be the God for all the families of Israel, and they shall be unto me for a people.
024	JER	031	002	Thus hath said the Lord, The people of those that are escaped of the sword found grace in the wilderness, —even Israel, when it went to find rest.
024	JER	031	003	“From afar is the Lord appeared unto me,” [saying,] Yea, with an everlasting love have I loved thee; therefore have I guided thee with loving-kindness.
024	JER	031	004	Yet again will I build thee up, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel: yet again shalt thou adorn thy timbrels, and go forth in the dances of those that make merry.
024	JER	031	005	Yet again shalt thou plant vineyards upon the mountains of Samaria: the planters shall plant, and shall redeem the fruit.
024	JER	031	006	For there cometh a day, that the watchers call out upon the mountain of Ephraim, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion unto the Lord our God.
024	JER	031	007	For thus hath said the Lord, Sing for Jacob with joy, and shout at the head of the nations: publish ye, praise ye, and say, The Lord hath helped thy people, the remnant of Israel.
024	JER	031	008	Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and I will gather them from the farthest ends of the earth, among them the blind and the lame, the pregnant woman and she that travaileth with child together: a great assembly shall they return hither.
024	JER	031	009	With weeping shall they come, and with supplications will I bring them in: I will lead them by brooks of water in a straight way, whereon they shall not stumble; for I am become a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my first-born.
024	JER	031	010	Hear the word of the Lord, O ye nations, and tell it in the isles afar off, and say, He that scattereth Israel will gather him, and keep him, as a shepherd his flock.
024	JER	031	011	For the Lord hath ransomed Jacob, and redeemed him out of the hand of one stronger than he.
024	JER	031	012	And they shall come and sing on the height of Zion, and shall come together as a stream to the goodness of the Lord, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flocks and of the herds, and their soul shall be as a well-watered garden; and they shall not farther experience grief any more.
024	JER	031	013	Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, and youth and old men together: and I will change their mourning into gladness, and I will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.
024	JER	031	014	And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the Lord.
024	JER	031	015	Thus hath said the Lord, A voice is heard in Ramah, groaning, weeping, and bitter lamentation; Rachel is weeping for her children: she refuseth to be comforted for her children because they are not [here].
024	JER	031	016	Thus hath said the Lord, Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thy eyes from tears; for there is a reward for thy work, saith the Lord, and they shall return from the land of the enemy.
024	JER	031	017	And there is hope for [thee in] thy future, saith the Lord, and thy children shall return to their own borders.
024	JER	031	018	I have indeed heard Ephraim bemoaning himself, “Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as an untamed calf; cause me to return, and I will return; for thou art the Lord my God.
024	JER	031	019	Surely after my returning, I repent; and after I am made conscious [by punishment], I smite upon my thigh: I am ashamed, yea, I am confounded, because I bear the disgrace of my youth.”
024	JER	031	020	Is not Ephraim a dear son unto me? or a child that I dandle? for whenever I speak of him, I do earnestly remember him again: therefore are my inward parts moved for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the Lord.
024	JER	031	021	Set thyself up waymarks, place thyself pillars; direct thy heart toward the highway, the way which thou didst go: return, O virgin of Israel, return to these thy cities.
024	JER	031	022	How long wilt thou roam about, O thou backsliding daughter? for the Lord hath created a new thing on the earth, The woman will go about [seeking for] the husband.
024	JER	031	023	Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Yet again shall they say this word in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof, when I will bring back again their captivity, —May the Lord bless thee, O habitation of righteousness, O holy mountain.
024	JER	031	024	And there shall dwell therein Judah, and in all his cities together, husbandmen, and they that move about with the flocks.
024	JER	031	025	For I have satiated the weary soul, and every grieving soul have I gratified.
024	JER	031	026	For this did I awake, and looked about, and my sleep was sweet unto me.
024	JER	031	027	Behold, days are coming, saith the Lord, when I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man; and with the seed of cattle.
024	JER	031	028	And it shall come to pass, that just as I have watched over them, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to overthrow, and to destroy, and to do harm: so will I watch over them, to build up, and to plant, saith the Lord.
024	JER	031	029	In those days shall they not say any more, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge;
024	JER	031	030	But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the sour grapes—his teeth shall be set on edge.
024	JER	031	031	Behold, days are coming, saith the Lord, when I will make with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah, a new covenant;
024	JER	031	032	Not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day that I took hold of them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they have broken, although I was become their husband, saith the Lord;
024	JER	031	033	But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel, after those days, saith the Lord, I place my law in their inward parts, and upon their heart will I write it; and I will be unto them for a God, and they shall be unto me for a people.
024	JER	031	034	And they shall not teach any more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for they all shall know me, from the least of them even unto their greatest, saith the Lord; for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin will I not remember any more.
024	JER	031	035	Thus hath said the Lord, who bestoweth the sun for a light by day, the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, who stirreth up the sea that its waves roar—The Lord of hosts is his name:
024	JER	031	036	If these ordinances ever depart from before me, saith the Lord, then also shall the seed of Israel cease from being a nation before me during all time.
024	JER	031	037	Thus hath said the Lord, If the heavens can be measured above, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath: then also will I reject all the seed of Israel, for all that they have done, saith the Lord.
024	JER	031	038	Behold, days are coming, saith the Lord, when the city shall be built up to the Lord from the tower of Chananel unto the corner-gate.
024	JER	031	039	And the measuring-line shall yet again go forth opposite it over the hill Gareb, and shall take a turn to Go'ath.
024	JER	031	040	And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all fields as far as the brook Kidron, unto the corner of the horse-gate toward the east, shall be holy unto the Lord: it shall not be plucked up, nor overthrown any more to eternity.
024	JER	032	001	The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the tenth year of Zedekiah the king of Judah, which is the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.
024	JER	032	002	And at that time the king of Babylon's army was besieging Jerusalem; and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which was in the house of the king of Judah;
024	JER	032	003	Because Zedekiah the king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore art thou prophesying, saying, Thus hath said the Lord, Behold, I will give up this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall capture it.
024	JER	032	004	And Zedekiah the king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, because he shall surely be given up into the hand of the king of Babylon, and his mouth shall speak to his mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;
024	JER	032	005	And to Babylon shall he lead Zedekiah, and there shall he remain until I think of him, saith the Lord: though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper.
024	JER	032	006	And Jeremiah said, The word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
024	JER	032	007	Behold, Chanamel the son of Shallum thy uncle is coming unto thee, saying, Buy for thyself my field that is in 'Anathoth; for unto thee belongeth the right of redemption to buy it.
024	JER	032	008	And there came to me Chanamel my uncle's son according to the word of the Lord into the court of the prison, and he said unto me, Buy, I pray thee, my field, that is in 'Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin; for to thee belongeth the right of inheritance, and to thee belongeth the redemption, buy it for thyself: then did I know that it was the word of the Lord.
024	JER	032	009	And I bought the field from Chanamel my uncle's son, that is in 'Anathoth; and I weighed out unto him the money, seven shekels, and ten pieces of silver.
024	JER	032	010	And I wrote it in a deed, and sealed it, and had it certified by witnesses, and weighed the money in balances.
024	JER	032	011	And I took the deed of the purchase, both that which was sealed, according to the law and custom, and that which was open;
024	JER	032	012	And I gave the deed of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriyah, the son of Machseyah, before the eyes of Chanamel my kinsman, and before the eyes of the witnesses that had signed the deed of the purchase, before the eyes of all the Jews that were sitting in the court of the prison.
024	JER	032	013	And I charged Baruch before their eyes, saying,
024	JER	032	014	Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Take these deeds, this deed of the purchase, both the sealed, and this open deed, and place them in an earthen vessel, in order that they may last many days.
024	JER	032	015	For thus hath said the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Yet again shall there be bought houses and fields and vineyards in this land.
024	JER	032	016	And I prayed to the Lord after I had delivered the deed of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriyah, saying,
024	JER	032	017	Ah Lord Eternal! behold, it is thou that hast made the heavens and the earth by thy great power and by thy outstretched arm; nothing is too wonderful for thee;
024	JER	032	018	Thou exercisest kindness unto the thousandth [generation], and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers unto the bosom of their children after them; [thou art] the Great, the Mighty God, the Lord of hosts is his name;
024	JER	032	019	Great in counsel, and mighty in execution: [thou] whose eyes are open over all the ways of the sons of man, to give unto every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings;
024	JER	032	020	Who hast displayed signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, up to this day, and in Israel, and among other men; and thou hast made thyself a name, as it is at this day;
024	JER	032	021	And thou didst bring forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terror;
024	JER	032	022	And thou gavest them this land, which thou hadst sworn to their fathers to give unto them, a land flowing with milk and honey;
024	JER	032	023	And they came in, and took possession of it; but they hearkened not to thy voice, and in thy law they did not walk; all that thou hadst commanded them to do they did not do: and thou hast therefore caused all this evil to befall them.
024	JER	032	024	Behold the mounds reach unto the city to capture it; and the city is given up into the hand of the Chaldeans, who fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest it.
024	JER	032	025	And yet thou hast said unto me, O Lord Eternal, Buy for thyself the field for money, and have it certified by witnesses: while the city is given up into the hand of the Chaldeans.
024	JER	032	026	Then came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah, saying,
024	JER	032	027	Behold, I am the Lord, the God of all flesh: shall any thing be too wonderful for me?
024	JER	032	028	Therefore thus hath said the Lord, Behold, I will give up this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, and he shall capture it:
024	JER	032	029	And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set this city on fire, and burn it, with the houses upon the roofs of which they have offered incense unto Ba'al, and have poured out drink-offerings unto other gods, in order to provoke me to anger;
024	JER	032	030	For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have been doing only what is evil in my eyes from their youth; for the children of Israel have been only provoking me to anger with the work of their hands, saith the Lord.
024	JER	032	031	For to excite my anger and my fury hath been unto me this city from the day that they built it, even until this day; so that I will remove it from before my presence:
024	JER	032	032	Because of all the wickedness of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
024	JER	032	033	And they turned unto me the back, and not the face: though [my prophets] taught them, rising up early and teaching; yet they hearkened not to receive instruction.
024	JER	032	034	But they placed their abominations in the house, which is called by my name, to defile it.
024	JER	032	035	And they built the high-places of Ba'al, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through [the fire] unto Molech; which I had not commanded them, and which had not come into my mind, to practise this abomination, in order to mislead Judah to sin.
024	JER	032	036	But now, therefore, thus hath said the Lord, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof ye say, it is given up into the hand of the king of Babylon through the sword, and through the famine, and through the pestilence:
024	JER	032	037	Behold, I will gather them out of all the countries, whither I have driven them in my anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them back again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell in safety;
024	JER	032	038	And they shall be unto me for a people, and I will be unto them for a God:
024	JER	032	039	And I will give them one heart, and one manner, to fear me at all times, that it may be well with them, and with their children after them;
024	JER	032	040	And I will make with them an everlasting covenant, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good on my part; and my fear will I place in their heart, so that they may not depart from me.
024	JER	032	041	And I will be glad over them to do them good; and I will plant them in this land in truth, with all my heart and with all my soul.
024	JER	032	042	For thus hath said the Lord, Just as I have brought upon this people all this great evil, so will I bring upon them all the good that I speak concerning them.
024	JER	032	043	And the field shall yet be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is desolate without man or beast, it is given up into the hand of the Chaldeans.
024	JER	032	044	Men shall buy fields for money, and write it in deeds, and seal it, and certify it by witnesses, in the land of Benjamin, and in the environs of Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountain, and in the cities of the lowlands, and in the cities of the south; for I will cause their captivity to return, saith the Lord.
024	JER	033	001	And the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah the second time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison, saying,
024	JER	033	002	Thus hath said the Lord who doth this, the Lord that formeth it, to establish it: the Eternal is his name;
024	JER	033	003	Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and I will tell thee great and unheard of things, which thou knowest not.
024	JER	033	004	For thus hath said the Lord, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are thrown down by means of the mounds, and by means of the sword;
024	JER	033	005	As they come to fight with the Chaldeans, but only to fill those with the corpses of the men whom I slay in my anger and in my fury, and for all whose wickedness I have hidden my face from this city:
024	JER	033	006	Behold, I will bring it healing and cure, and I will cure them, and I will display unto them the abundance of peace and truth.
024	JER	033	007	And I will cause to return the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel, and I will build them up, as at the first.
024	JER	033	008	And I will cleanse them from all their guiltiness, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned toward me, and whereby they have transgressed against me.
024	JER	033	009	And it shall be to me for a name of gladness, a praise and an honor with all the nations of the earth, who will hear all the good that I am doing unto them: and they shall dread and tremble because of all the good and because of all the happiness that I prepare unto it.
024	JER	033	010	Thus hath said the Lord, Yet again shall there be heard in this place, of which ye say, “It is ruined, without man and without beast” [[even] in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast,]
024	JER	033	011	The voice of gladness, and the voice of joy, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of those that say, “Give thanks unto the Lord of hosts; for the Lord is good; because to eternity endureth his kindness:” of those that bring thanksgiving-offering unto the house of the Lord. For I will cause to return the captivity of the land, as at the first, saith the Lord.
024	JER	033	012	Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, Yet again shall there be in this place, which is ruined, without man and even without beast, and in all its cities, a habitation of shepherds who cause their flocks to lie down.
024	JER	033	013	In the cities of the mountain, in the cities of the lowlands, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the environs of Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks yet pass again under the hands of him that counteth them, saith the Lord.
024	JER	033	014	Behold, days are coming, saith the Lord, when I will fulfill that good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and respecting the house of Judah.
024	JER	033	015	In those days, and at that time, will I cause to grow up unto David the sprout of righteousness: and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.
024	JER	033	016	In those days shall Judah be helped, and Jerusalem shall dwell in safety: and this is what she shall be called, The Lord is our righteousness.
024	JER	033	017	For thus hath said the Lord, There shall never be wanting unto David a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel;
024	JER	033	018	And unto the priests the Levites there shall not be wanting a man before me, to offer burnt-offerings, and to burn meat-offerings, and to prepare sacrifices at all times.
024	JER	033	019	And the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah, saying,
024	JER	033	020	Thus hath said the Lord, If ye can break my covenant with the day, and my covenant with the night, and so, that there be not day and night in their season:
024	JER	033	021	Then also shall my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and [that] with the Levites the priests, my ministers.
024	JER	033	022	As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, and the sand of the sea not be measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites that minister unto me.
024	JER	033	023	And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying,
024	JER	033	024	Hast thou not observed what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which the Lord hath made choice of, even these hath he rejected: and they [thus] have despised my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.
024	JER	033	025	Thus hath said the Lord, If my covenant be not with day and night, if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth:
024	JER	033	026	Then also will I reject the seed of Jacob, and David my servant, so as not to take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; for I will cause their captivity to return, and have mercy on them.
024	JER	034	001	The word which came unto Jeremiah from the Lord, when Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the country ruled by his power, and all the people, fought against Jerusalem, and against all its cities, saying,
024	JER	034	002	Thus hath said the Lord, the God of Israel, Go and speak to Zedekiah the king of Judah, and say to him, Thus hath said the Lord, Behold, I will give up this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, that he may burn it with fire:
024	JER	034	003	And thou thyself shalt not escape out of his hand; but thou shalt surely be caught, and be delivered into his hand; and thy eyes shall see the eyes of the king of Babylon, and his mouth shall speak with thy mouth, and to Babylon shalt thou go.
024	JER	034	004	Yet hear the word of the Lord, O Zedekiah king of Judah, Thus hath said the Lord respecting thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword:
024	JER	034	005	In peace shalt thou die; and as burnings were made for thy fathers, the former kings who were before thee, so shall they make burnings for thee; and “Ah lord” shall they lament for thee; for I have spoken the word, saith the Lord.
024	JER	034	006	And Jeremiah the prophet spoke unto Zedekiah the king of Judah all these words in Jerusalem,
024	JER	034	007	When the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against 'Azekah; for these had been left of the cities of Judah as fortified cities.
024	JER	034	008	The word which came unto Jeremiah from the Lord, after king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who were at Jerusalem, to proclaim among themselves freedom;
024	JER	034	009	That every man should dismiss his man-servant, and every man his maid-servant, being a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman, free; so that no man among them should exact labor of a Jew, his brother.
024	JER	034	010	And all the princes had hearkened, with all the people, who had entered into the covenant, that every one should dismiss his man-servant, and every one his maid-servant, free, that no one should exact labor of them any more: and they had obeyed, and dismissed them.
024	JER	034	011	But they had turned afterward, and they had brought back the men-servants and the maid-servants whom they had dismissed as free, and had subjected them to become men-servants and maid-servants.
024	JER	034	012	And the word of the Lord [then] came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying,
024	JER	034	013	Thus hath said the Lord, the God of Israel, —I myself made a covenant with your fathers on the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondmen, saying,
024	JER	034	014	At the end of seven years shall ye dismiss every man his brother the Hebrew, who may have been sold unto thee; and when he hath served thee six years, then shalt thou dismiss him from thee; but your fathers hearkened not unto me, and inclined not their ear.
024	JER	034	015	And ye had turned this day, and done what is right in my eyes, to proclaim freedom every man to his neighbor; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house over which my name is called;
024	JER	034	016	But ye have turned again, and profaned my name, and ye have brought back every man his man-servant, and every man his woman-servant, whom ye had dismissed as free at their pleasure, and have subjected them to be unto you for men-servants and for women-servants.
024	JER	034	017	Therefore thus hath said the Lord, Ye indeed have not hearkened unto me, to proclaim freedom, every one to his brother, and every one to his neighbor: behold, I proclaim a freedom over you, saith the Lord, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you a horror unto all the kingdoms of the earth.
024	JER	034	018	And I will give up the men that have transgressed my covenant, who have not fulfilled the words of the covenant which they had made before me, at the calf which they cut in twain, and between the parts whereof they passed,
024	JER	034	019	The princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the court-servants, and the priests, and all the people of the land, who have passed between the parts of the calf;
024	JER	034	020	[Yea] I will give them up into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek their life; and their dead bodies shall become food unto the fowls of the heavens, and to the beasts of the earth.
024	JER	034	021	And Zedekiah the king of Judah and his princes will I give up into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek their life, and into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, that are [now] gone away from you.
024	JER	034	022	Behold, I will command, speaketh the Lord, and I will bring them back to this city; and they shall fight against it, and capture it, and burn it with fire: and the cities of Judah will I make a desert without an inhabitant.
024	JER	035	001	The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, [in] the days of Jehoyakim the son of Josiah the king of Judah, saying,
024	JER	035	002	Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak with them, and bring them into the house of the Lord, into one of the chambers, and offer them wine to drink.
024	JER	035	003	Then I took Yaazanyah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Chabazzinyah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites;
024	JER	035	004	And I brought them into the house of the Lord, into the chamber of the sons of Chanan, the son of Yigdalyahu, the man of God, which was alongside of the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of Ma'aseyahu the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door:
024	JER	035	005	And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites goblets full of wine, and cups; and I said unto them, Drink wine.
024	JER	035	006	But they said, We will not drink wine; for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father hath laid a charge on us, saying, Ye shall not drink wine, neither ye, nor your sons for ever;
024	JER	035	007	Nor shall ye build any house, nor sow seed, nor plant a vineyard, nor have [any such]; but in tents shall ye dwell all your days, in order that ye may live many days on the face of the land where ye may sojourn.
024	JER	035	008	And we have hearkened unto the voice of Jehonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he hath charged us, not to drink any wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, and our daughters;
024	JER	035	009	And not to build houses for our dwelling: and we never had any vineyard, or field, or seed;
024	JER	035	010	But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done in accordance with all that Jonadab our father commanded us.
024	JER	035	011	But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go into Jerusalem because of the army of the Chaldeans, and because of the army of the Syrians; and so we dwell at Jerusalem.
024	JER	035	012	Then came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah, saying,
024	JER	035	013	Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Go and say to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words? saith the Lord.
024	JER	035	014	Fulfilled are the words of Jehonadab the son of Rechab, that he hath commanded his sons not to drink wine: and they have not drunk any even unto this day; because they have obeyed the commandment of their father; but I, I have spoken unto you, early in the day and speaking; but ye have not hearkened unto me.
024	JER	035	015	And I have sent unto you all my servants the prophets, making them rise up early and sending them, saying, Do but return every man from his evil way, and amend your deeds, and go not after other gods to serve them: and so shall ye remain in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers; but ye have not inclined your ear, and have not hearkened unto me.
024	JER	035	016	Because the sons of Jehonadab the son of Rechab have fulfilled the commandment of their father, which he hath commanded them; but as this people have not hearkened unto me:
024	JER	035	017	Therefore thus hath said the Lord, the God of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have spoken concerning them; because I spoke unto them, but they would not hear; and I called unto them, but they would not answer.
024	JER	035	018	And unto the house of the Rechabites said Jeremiah, Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Whereas ye have hearkened to the charge of Jonadab your father, and have kept all his commandments, and have done in accordance with all that he hath commanded you:
024	JER	035	019	Therefore thus hath said the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, There shall not be wanting unto Jehonadab the son of Rechab a man to stand before me at all times.
024	JER	036	001	And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoyakim the son of Josiah the king of Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from the Lord, saying,
024	JER	036	002	Take thee a roll-book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day that I spoke unto thee, from the days of Josiah, even until this day.
024	JER	036	003	Peradventure it be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them: in order that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.
024	JER	036	004	Then did Jeremiah call Baruch the son of Neriyah: and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the Lord, which he had spoken unto him, upon a roll-book.
024	JER	036	005	And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I am not able to enter into the house of the Lord:
024	JER	036	006	Therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the Lord before the ears of the people in the house of the Lord on the fast-day; and also before the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities shalt thou read them.
024	JER	036	007	Perhaps it may be that they will humbly present their supplication before the Lord, and will return every one from his evil way; for great are the anger and the fury that the Lord hath decreed against this people.
024	JER	036	008	And Baruch the son of Neriyah did in accordance with all that Jeremiah the prophet had commanded him, to read in the book the words of the Lord in the house of the Lord.
024	JER	036	009	And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoyakim the son of Josiah the king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before the Lord for all the people in Jerusalem, and for all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem.
024	JER	036	010	And Baruch read in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the Lord, in the chamber of Gemaryahu the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the upper court, at the entrance of the new gate of the Lord's house, before the ears of all the people.
024	JER	036	011	And when Michayhu the son of Gemaryahu, the son of Shaphan, had heard all the words of the Lord out of the book:
024	JER	036	012	He went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber; and, lo, all the princes were sitting there, even Elishama' the scribe, and Delayahu the son of Shema'yahu, and Elnathan the son of 'Achbor, and Gemaryahu the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Chananyahu, and all the princes.
024	JER	036	013	And Michayhu told unto them all the words which he had heard, when Baruch read in the book before the ears of the people.
024	JER	036	014	Thereupon sent all the princes Jehudi the son of Nethanyahu, the son of Shelemyahu, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, The roll wherein thou hast read before the ears of the people, —this take in thy hand, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriyahu took the roll in his hand, and came unto them.
024	JER	036	015	And they said unto him, Sit down, we pray thee, and read it before our ears. So Baruch read it before their ears.
024	JER	036	016	Now it came to pass, when they heard all the words, they looked terrified at each other, and they said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.
024	JER	036	017	And they asked Baruch, saying, Do tell us, How didst thou write down all these words from his mouth?
024	JER	036	018	Then said Baruch unto them, With his mouth did he utter clearly all these words unto me, and I wrote them in the book with ink.
024	JER	036	019	Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thyself, thou with Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye are.
024	JER	036	020	And they went in to the king into the court, but the roll they had put in safe keeping in the chamber of Elishama' the scribe; and they told before the ears of the king all the words.
024	JER	036	021	But the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll; and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama' the scribe. And Jehudi read it before the ears of the king, and before the ears of all the princes who stood around the king.
024	JER	036	022	Now the king was sitting in the winter-house in the ninth month: and a pan of coals was burning before him.
024	JER	036	023	And it came to pass, when Jehudi had read three or four pages, that he cut it with the writer's knife, and cast it into the fire that was in the coal-pan, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was in the coal-pan.
024	JER	036	024	Yet they were not terrified, nor did they rend their garments, either the king, or any of his servants that had heard all these words.
024	JER	036	025	And although Elnathan and Delayahu and Gemaryahu had also made intercession with the king that he might not burn the roll, he would not listen to them.
024	JER	036	026	And the king commanded Yerachmeel the son of the king, and Serayahu the son of 'Azriel, and Shelemyahu the son of 'Abdeel, to seize on Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet; but the Lord hid them.
024	JER	036	027	Then came the word of the Lord to Jeremiah, after the king had burnt the roll, and the words which Baruch had written down from the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,
024	JER	036	028	Take thee again another roll, and write on it all the former words that have been on the first roll, which Jehoyakim the king of Judah hath burnt.
024	JER	036	029	And concerning Jehoyakim the king of Judah shalt thou say, Thus hath said the Lord, Thou hast indeed burnt this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease therefrom man and beast!
024	JER	036	030	Therefore thus hath said the Lord concerning Jehoyakim the king of Judah, He shall have no one to sit upon the throne of David; and his dead body shall be cast out to the heat in the day, and to the cold in the night.
024	JER	036	031	And I will visit on him and on his seed and on his servants their iniquity; and I will bring over them, and over the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and against the men of Judah, all the evil that I have spoken against them, while they did not hearken.
024	JER	036	032	And Jeremiah took another roll, and gave it to Baruch the son of Neriyahu the scribe; who wrote thereon from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoyakim the king of Judah had burnt in the fire: and there were yet added unto them many words like them.
024	JER	037	001	And Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned as king in the place of Conyahu the son of Jehoyakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah.
024	JER	037	002	But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken unto the words of the Lord, which he had spoken by means of Jeremiah the prophet.
024	JER	037	003	And king Zedekiah sent Jehuchal the son of Shelemyah and Zephanyahu the son of Ma'asseyah the priest unto Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Pray now in our behalf unto the Lord our God.
024	JER	037	004	Now Jeremiah came and went out among the people; and they put him not into the prison-house.
024	JER	037	005	But the army of Pharaoh was come forth out of Egypt: and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard the report of them, they withdrew from Jerusalem.
024	JER	037	006	Then came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
024	JER	037	007	Thus hath said the Lord, the God of Israel, Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah, that hath sent you unto me to inquire of me, Behold, Pharaoh's army, which is come forth to help you, returneth into its own land to Egypt.
024	JER	037	008	But the Chaldeans will come again, and fight against this city, and capture it, and burn it with fire.
024	JER	037	009	Thus hath said the Lord, Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans will certainly go away from us; for they will not go away.
024	JER	037	010	For if even ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained among them [only such] men as are pierced through: yet should they rise up, every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.
024	JER	037	011	And it came to pass, when the army of the Chaldeans had withdrawn from Jerusalem because of the army of Pharaoh,
024	JER	037	012	That Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to make his escape thence in the midst of the people.
024	JER	037	013	But as he was in the gate of Benjamin, there was there a captain of the guardsmen, whose name was Yiriyah, the son of Shelemyah, the son of Chananyah; and he seized hold of Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou runnest away to the Chaldeans.
024	JER	037	014	But Jeremiah said, It is false; I am not running away to the Chaldeans. But he listened not to him; and Yiriyah seized hold of Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.
024	JER	037	015	Thereupon were the princes wroth with Jeremiah, and struck him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe; for that had they made into a prison-house.
024	JER	037	016	When Jeremiah had been placed in the dungeon, within the traders' shops, where Jeremiah remained many days:
024	JER	037	017	King Zedekiah sent, and had him taken out, and the king asked him in his house in secret, and said, “Is there any word from the Lord?” And Jeremiah said, “There is:” and he said, Into the hand of the king of Babylon shalt thou be given up.
024	JER	037	018	And Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I sinned against thee, and against thy servants, and against this people, that ye have put me into the prison-house?
024	JER	037	019	And where are now your prophets who have prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon will not come against you, and against this land?
024	JER	037	020	Yet now, do but hear, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let me offer my humble supplication, I pray thee, before thee, that thou wilt not make me return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.
024	JER	037	021	Then commanded king Zedekiah that they should put Jeremiah in ward in the court of the prison, and that they should give him a loaf of bread for every day out of the bakers' street, until all the bread was spent out of the city. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.
024	JER	038	001	And Shephatyah the son of Matthan, and Gedalyahu the son of Pashchur, and Juchal the son of Shelemyahu, and Pashchur the son of Malkiyah, heard the words that Jeremiah was speaking unto all the people, saying,
024	JER	038	002	Thus hath said the Lord, He that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live; and he shall have his life as a booty, and shall live.
024	JER	038	003	Thus hath said the Lord, This city shall surely be given up into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he shall capture it.
024	JER	038	004	Thereupon said the princes unto the king, We beseech thee, let this man be put to death; for the cause that he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that are yet left in this city, and the hands of all the people, by speaking such words unto them; for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but their hurt.
024	JER	038	005	Then said king Zedekiah, Behold, he is in your hand; for the king is not able to do any thing against you.
024	JER	038	006	Then did they take Jeremiah, and cast him into the pit of Malkiyahu the son of the king, that was in the court of the prison: and they let Jeremiah down with cords; but in the pit there was no water, but mire; so that Jeremiah sunk into the mire.
024	JER	038	007	Now when 'Ebed-melech the Cushi, a eunuch who was in the king's house, heard that they had placed Jeremiah into the pit; while the king was sitting in the gate of Benjamin:
024	JER	038	008	'Ebed-melech went forth out of the king's house, and spoke to the king, saying,
024	JER	038	009	My lord, O king, these men have done wrong in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the pit; and he would have had to die [as it is] in the place where he was for hunger; for there is no more bread in the city.
024	JER	038	010	The king then commanded 'Ebed-melech the Cushi, saying, Take with thee from here thirty men, and bring up Jeremiah the prophet out of the pit, before he die.
024	JER	038	011	So 'Ebed-melech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence cast-off clothes and old rags, and let them down into the pit to Jeremiah by cords.
024	JER	038	012	And Ebed-melech the Cushi said unto Jeremiah, Put, I pray, these cast-off clothes and old rags under thy arm-pits beneath the cords. And Jeremiah did so.
024	JER	038	013	So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and brought him up out of the pit: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.
024	JER	038	014	Then sent king Zedekiah, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that was in the house of the Lord; and the king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee something: conceal nothing from me.
024	JER	038	015	Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, If I should tell it unto thee, behold, thou wilt surely put me to death; and if I should give thee counsel, thou wilt not hearken unto me.
024	JER	038	016	So king Zedekiah swore unto Jeremiah secretly, saying, As the Lord liveth, who hath made for us this soul, I will not put thee to death, nor will I give thee up into the hand of these men that seek thy life.
024	JER	038	017	Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus hath said the Lord, the God of hosts, the God of Israel, If thou wilt indeed go forth unto the princes of the king of Babylon, then shall thy soul live, and this city shall not be burnt with fire; and thou shalt live, thou with thy household;
024	JER	038	018	But if thou wilt not go forth to the princes of the king of Babylon, then shall this city be given up into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou thyself shalt not escape out of their hand.
024	JER	038	019	Then said king Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, I am in dread of the Jews that have run away to the Chaldeans, lest these deliver me into their hand, and they might ill-use me.
024	JER	038	020	But Jeremiah said, They will not give [thee] up. Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of the Lord, in that which I speak unto thee; so it shall be well unto thee, and thy soul shall live.
024	JER	038	021	But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the Lord hath shown me:
024	JER	038	022	And behold, all the women that are left in the house of the king of Judah shall be led forth to the princes of the king of Babylon; and these women shall say, “They have enticed, and have overpersuaded thee—thy men that should have sought thy welfare; thy feet are [now] sunk in the mire, and they have withdrawn themselves backward.”
024	JER	038	023	And all thy wives and thy children shall they bring out to the Chaldeans; and thou thyself shalt not escape out of their hand; for by the hand of the king of Babylon shalt thou be caught; and this city wilt thou cause to be burnt with fire.
024	JER	038	024	Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, that thou mayest not die.
024	JER	038	025	And if the princes should hear that I have spoken with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee, tell us, we pray thee, what thou hast spoken unto the king, conceal it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king hath spoken unto thee:
024	JER	038	026	Then shalt thou say unto them, I presented my humble supplication before the king, that he would not send me back to the house of Jonathan, to die there.
024	JER	038	027	And all the princes came unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told them in accordance with all these words that the king had commanded. And they turned away silent from him; for the matter had not been made public.
024	JER	038	028	And Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken. And it came to pass when Jerusalem was captured,
024	JER	039	001	In the ninth year of Zedekiah the king of Judah, in the tenth month, that Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon came with all his army against Jerusalem, and they besieged it.
024	JER	039	002	[And] in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, was the city broken in.
024	JER	039	003	And then came all the princes of the king of Babylon, and sat down in the middle gate; [namely,] Neregal-sharezer, Samgar-nebu, Sarsechim, the chief of the eunuchs, Neregal-sharezer, the chief of the magi, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon.
024	JER	039	004	And it came to pass when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all the men of war, that they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, by the gate between the two walls: and he went out by the way of the plain.
024	JER	039	005	But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them, and they overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and they took him, and brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Chamath: and he called him to account.
024	JER	039	006	And the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes; also all the nobles of Judah did the king of Babylon slaughter.
024	JER	039	007	And the eyes of Zedekiah did he blind; and he bound him with brazen fetters, to carry him to Babylon.
024	JER	039	008	And the house of the king, and the houses of the people did the Chaldeans burn with fire, and the walls of Jerusalem did they pull down.
024	JER	039	009	And the rest of the people that remained in the city, and those who had run away that had run away to him, with the rest of the people that remained, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry off into exile to Babylon.
024	JER	039	010	But of the poorest of the people, who had nothing, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard leave some in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and arable fields at the same time.
024	JER	039	011	And Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah through means of Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,
024	JER	039	012	Take him, and direct thy eyes to him, and do him not the least harm; but as he may speak unto thee, even so do thou with him.
024	JER	039	013	Then sent Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, and Nebushazban, the chief of the eunuchs, and Neregal-sharezer, the chief of the magi, and all the chiefs of the king of Babylon, —
024	JER	039	014	Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and they committed him unto Gedalyahu the son of Achikam the son of Shaphan, to carry him home: and he remained in the midst of the people.
024	JER	039	015	But unto Jeremiah was come the word of the Lord while he was shut up in the court of the prison, saying,
024	JER	039	016	Go and say to 'Ebed-melech the Cushi as followeth, Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will bring my words [to fulfillment] against this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be accomplished before thee on that day.
024	JER	039	017	But I will deliver thee on that day, saith the Lord; and thou shalt not be given up into the hand of the men of whom thou hast dread.
024	JER	039	018	For I will surely let thee escape, and thou shalt not fall by the sword; but thy life shall be unto thee as a booty; because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the Lord.
024	JER	040	001	The word that came unto Jeremiah from the Lord, after Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had dismissed him from Ramah, when he had taken him as he was bound in chains in the midst of all the exiles of Jerusalem and Judah, who were carried away into exile unto Babylon.
024	JER	040	002	Then took the captain of the guard Jeremiah, and said unto him, The Lord thy God had spoken this evil over this place;
024	JER	040	003	Now the Lord hath brought it [to fulfillment], and hath done according as he had spoken; because ye had sinned against the Lord, and had not hearkened to his voice; and therefore is this thing come upon you.
024	JER	040	004	And now, behold, I have freed thee this day from the chains which were upon thy hand. If it seem good in thy eyes to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will direct my eye unto thee; but if it seem ill in thy eyes to come with me to Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land is before thee; whither it seemeth good and proper in thy eyes to go, thither go.
024	JER	040	005	And as he did not yet turn about, [he said,] Go then back to Gedalyah the son of Achikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath appointed governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him in the midst of the people; or wheresoever it seemeth proper in thy eyes to go, go. And the captain of the guard gave him an allowance and a present, and then dismissed him.
024	JER	040	006	So did Jeremiah come unto Gedalyah the son of Achikam to Mizpah; and he dwelt with him in the midst of the people that had been left in the land.
024	JER	040	007	Now when all the captains of the armies who were in the field, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedalyahu the son of Achikam governor over the land, and that he had entrusted unto him men, and women, and children, and these of the poorest of the land, of those that had not been carried away into exile to Babylon:
024	JER	040	008	Then came they to Gedalyah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethanyahu, and Jochanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareach, and Serayah the son of Tanchumeth, and the sons of 'Ephai the Netophathite, and Yezanyahu the son of a Ma'achathite, they and their men.
024	JER	040	009	And Gedalyahu the son of Achikam the son of Shaphan swore unto them and unto their men, saying, Have no fear to serve the Chaldeans: remain in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it will be well with you.
024	JER	040	010	As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to stand before the Chaldeans, who will come unto us; but ye, gather ye together wine, and summer-fruits, and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities of which ye have taken possession.
024	JER	040	011	And so likewise all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the children of 'Ammon, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant unto Judah, and that he had appointed over them Gedalyahu the son of Achikam the son of Shaphan;
024	JER	040	012	And then did all the Jews return out of all places whither they had been driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedalyahu, unto Mizpah, and gathered together wine and summer-fruits in very great abundance.
024	JER	040	013	And Jochanan the son of Kareach, and all the captains of the armies that were in the field, came to Gedalyahu to Mizpah,
024	JER	040	014	And they said unto him, Dost thou at all know that Ba'alis the king of the children of 'Ammon hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethanyah to deprive thee of life? But Gedalyahu the son of Achikam believed them not.
024	JER	040	015	And Jochanan the son of Kareach said to Gedalyahu secretly in Mizpah, as followeth, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethanyah, and no man shall know of it: wherefore should he deprive thee of life, whereby all the Jews who are gathered unto thee would be scattered, and the remnant of Judah be lost?
024	JER	040	016	But Gedalyahu the son of Achikam said unto Jochanan the son of Kareach, Thou shalt not do this thing; for thou speakest a falsehood concerning Ishmael.
024	JER	041	001	Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethanyah the son of Elishama', of the royal seed, and the chiefs of the king, even ten men with him, came unto Gedalyahu the son of Achikam to Mizpah; and they ate there bread together in Mizpah.
024	JER	041	002	Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethanyah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedalyahu the son of Achikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and put to death him, whom the king of Babylon had appointed governor over the land.
024	JER	041	003	And all the Jews that were with him, even with Gedalyahu, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, even the men of war, did Ishmael slay.
024	JER	041	004	And it came to pass on the second day after he had put Gedalyahu to death, while no man knew of it,
024	JER	041	005	That there came certain men from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, eighty men [in all], having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with meat-offerings and frankincense in their hand, to bring the same to the house of the Lord.
024	JER	041	006	And Ishmael the son of Nethanyah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, going along and weeping: and it came to pass as he met them, that he said unto them, Come to Gedalyahu the son of Achikam.
024	JER	041	007	And it happened, as they entered into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethanyah slaughtered them, [and cast them] into the midst of the cistern, he, and the men that were with him.
024	JER	041	008	But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not; for we have some things hidden in the field, [such as] wheat, and barley, and oil, and honey. So he forbore, and slew them not in the midst of their brethren.
024	JER	041	009	And the cistern wherein Ishmael cast all the corpses of the men, whom he had slain in company with Gedalyahu, is the same which king Assa had made on account of Ba'sha the king of Israel: this did Ishmael the son of Nethanyah fill with slain persons.
024	JER	041	010	Then did Ishmael carry away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, the king's daughters, and all the people that were remaining in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had entrusted to Gedalyahu the son of Achikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethanyah carried them away captive, and went off to pass over to the children of Ammon.
024	JER	041	011	But when Jochanan the son of Kareach, and all the captains of the armies that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethanyah had done:
024	JER	041	012	Then did they take all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethanyah, and found him by the great water[-pool] that is near Gib'on.
024	JER	041	013	And it came to pass, when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Jochanan the son of Kareach, and all the captains of the armies that were with him, that they were rejoiced.
024	JER	041	014	And all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned about and returned, and went unto Jochanan the son of Kareach.
024	JER	041	015	But Ishmael the son of Nethanyah escaped with eight men from the presence of Jochanan, and he went to the children of 'Ammon.
024	JER	041	016	Then took Jochanan the son of Kareach, and all the captains of the armies that were with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethanyah, from Mizpah, after he had slain Gedalyah the son of Achikam, the adult males, the men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gib'on;
024	JER	041	017	And they went, and remained in Geruth-Kimham, which is by Beth-lechem, to go to enter into Egypt,
024	JER	041	018	Because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them; because Ishmael the son of Nethanyah had slain Gedalyahu the son of Achikam, whom the king of Babylon had appointed governor over the land.
024	JER	042	001	Then came near all the captains of the armies, and Jochanan the son of Kareach, and Yezanyah the son of Hosha'yah, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest,
024	JER	042	002	And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our humble supplication be accepted before thee, and pray in our behalf unto the Lord thy God, in behalf of all this remnant; [for we are left but a few of many, as thy own eyes do see us:]
024	JER	042	003	That the Lord thy God may tell us the way whereon we should walk, and the thing that we should do.
024	JER	042	004	Then said Jeremiah the prophet unto them, I have heard you: behold, I will pray unto the Lord your God according to your words; and it shall come to pass, that whatsoever thing the Lord will answer you, I will tell unto you; I will withhold not a word from you.
024	JER	042	005	But they said to Jeremiah, May the Lord be a true and faithful witness against us, if we do not act entirely according to all the word with which the Lord thy God may send thee to us:
024	JER	042	006	Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will hearken to the voice of the Lord our God, to whom we send thee; in order that it may be well with us, when we hearken to the voice of the Lord our God.
024	JER	042	007	And it came to pass at the end of ten days, that the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah.
024	JER	042	008	Then called he Jochanan the son of Kareach, and all the captains of the armies who were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,
024	JER	042	009	And he said unto them, Thus hath said the Lord, the God of Israel, unto whom ye sent me to present your humble supplication before him:
024	JER	042	010	If ye will indeed remain in this land, then will I build you up, and I will not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up; for I have bethought me of the evil that I have done unto you.
024	JER	042	011	Be ye not afraid because of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid: have no fear of him, saith the Lord; for I am with you to save you, and to deliver you out of his hand.
024	JER	042	012	And I will give unto you mercy, that he may have mercy upon you, and let you return to your own land.
024	JER	042	013	But if ye say, We will not remain in this land, so as not to hearken to the voice of the Lord your God,
024	JER	042	014	Saying, No; but into the land of Egypt will we go, that we may not see war, nor hear the sound of the cornet, and that we may not have hunger for bread; and there will we dwell;
024	JER	042	015	And now therefore hear the word of the Lord, ye remnant of Judah, Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, If ye will indeed set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go thither to sojourn there:
024	JER	042	016	Then shall the sword, of which ye are afraid, there overtake you in the land of Egypt; and the famine, whereof ye are in dread, shall there cleave close unto you in Egypt; and there shall ye die.
024	JER	042	017	So shall be all the men that have set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there, —they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; and they shall have none that remaineth or escapeth from the evil that I am bringing over them.
024	JER	042	018	For thus hath said the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, As my anger and my fury were poured forth over the inhabitants of Jerusalem: so shall my fury be poured forth over you, when ye enter into Egypt; and ye shall become an oath, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a disgrace; and ye shall never see this place again.
024	JER	042	019	The Lord hath spoken concerning you, O ye remnant of Judah, “Ye shall not go into Egypt:” ye must know for certain that I have warned you this day.
024	JER	042	020	For ye have dissembled in regard to what your intentions are; for ye sent me unto the Lord your God, saying, Pray in our behalf unto the Lord our God: and in accordance with all that the Lord our God may say, so tell unto us, and we will do it.
024	JER	042	021	And I have told it to you this day; but ye have not hearkened to the voice of the Lord your God, and this in all with which he hath sent me unto you.
024	JER	042	022	But now know for certain that ye shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye desire to go to sojourn there.
024	JER	043	001	And it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto the whole people all the words of the Lord their God, with which the Lord their God had sent him to them, [namely,] all these words,
024	JER	043	002	That then spoke 'Azaryah the son of Hosha'yah, and Jochanan the son of Kareach, and all the presumptuous men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsely: the Lord our God hath not sent thee to say, Ye shall not go into Egypt to sojourn there;
024	JER	043	003	But Baruch the son of Neriyah setteth thee on against us, in order to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may put us to death, or carry us away as exiles to Babylon.
024	JER	043	004	So Jochanan the son of Kareach, and all the captains of the armies, and all the people, hearkened not to the voice of the Lord, to remain in the land of Judah.
024	JER	043	005	But Jochanan the son of Kareach, and all the captains of the armies, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all the nations, whither they had been driven, to sojourn in the land of Judah;
024	JER	043	006	The men, and the women, and the children, and the king's daughters, and every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedalyahu the son of Achikam the son of Shaphan; and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriyah;
024	JER	043	007	And they entered into the land of Egypt; for they hearkened not to the voice of the Lord; and they came as far as Thachpanches.
024	JER	043	008	Then came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah in Thachpanches, saying,
024	JER	043	009	Take great stones in thy hand, and hide them in the mortar in the brick-kiln which is at the entrance of Pharaoh's house in Thachpanches, before the eyes of the Jewish men;
024	JER	043	010	And thou shalt say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will send for and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and I will set his throne above these stones that I have hidden; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them.
024	JER	043	011	And he shall come and smite the land of Egypt: such as are destined for death shall be given to death; and such as are destined for captivity, to captivity; and such as are destined for the sword, to the sword.
024	JER	043	012	And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt, and he shall burn them, and carry them away captive: and he shall wrap around him the land of Egypt, as a shepherd wrappeth his garment around him; and he shall go forth from there in peace.
024	JER	043	013	And he shall break the statues of Bethshemesh, which is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire.
024	JER	044	001	The word that came to Jeremiah for all the Jews who dwell in the land of Egypt, who dwell at Migdol, and at Thachpanches, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying,
024	JER	044	002	Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, You yourselves have seen all the evil that I have brought over Jerusalem, and over all the cities of Judah; and, behold, they are ruins this day, and no man is dwelling in them;
024	JER	044	003	Because of their wickedness which they had committed to provoke me to anger, by going to burn incense, to serve other gods, whom they did not know, either they, you, or your fathers.
024	JER	044	004	And I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, making them rise early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not commit this abominable thing which I hate.
024	JER	044	005	But they hearkened not, and inclined not their ear to turn away from their wickedness, so as not to burn incense unto other gods.
024	JER	044	006	Whereupon my fury and my anger were poured forth, and were enkindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: and they are become ruins, a desert, as at this day.
024	JER	044	007	And now thus hath said the Lord, the God of hosts, the God of Israel, Wherefore do ye commit so great an evil against your souls, so as to cut off unto you man and woman, child and suckling, out of the midst of Judah, so as not to leave you any remainder,
024	JER	044	008	By provoking me unto wrath with the works of your hands, in burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye are come to sojourn there, in order to cut yourselves off, and in order that ye might become a curse and a disgrace among all the nations of the earth?
024	JER	044	009	Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they had committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?
024	JER	044	010	They are not humbled even up to this day, and they are not afraid, and they walk not in my law, nor in my statutes, that I have set before you and before your fathers.
024	JER	044	011	Therefore thus hath said the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah.
024	JER	044	012	And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all come to their end, and in the land of Egypt shall they fall: by the sword [and] by the famine shall they come to their end; from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by the famine shall they die; and they shall become an oath, an astonishment, and a curse, and a disgrace.
024	JER	044	013	And I will inflict punishment on those that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have inflicted punishment on Jerusalem, through the sword, through the famine, and through the pestilence:
024	JER	044	014	So that there shall be no one that escapeth or remaineth of the remnant of Judah, who are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, that they should return into the land of Judah, to which they direct [the desire of] their soul to return thither to dwell there; for they shall not return, but such as shall escape.
024	JER	044	015	Then did all the men who knew that their wives were burning incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, and all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answer Jeremiah, saying,
024	JER	044	016	Respecting the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee.
024	JER	044	017	For to a surety we will do all the word that is gone forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: when we had plenty of food, and fared well, and saw no evil.
024	JER	044	018	But since the time we have left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto her, have we had a lack of every thing; and we have come to our end through the sword and through the famine.
024	JER	044	019	And when we burnt incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink-offerings unto her, —was this without [the consent of] our husbands, that we did make cakes for her to make her image, and pour out drink-offerings unto her?
024	JER	044	020	Then said Jeremiah unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people who had answered him [with that] word, saying,
024	JER	044	021	Behold, it was the incense that ye burnt in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, which the Lord remembered, and which came into his mind;
024	JER	044	022	So that the Lord could no longer endure it, because of the evil of your doings, because of the abominations which ye had committed: therefore is your land become a ruin, and an [object of] astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day.
024	JER	044	023	Because that ye had burnt incense, and because ye had sinned against the Lord, and had not hearkened to the voice of the Lord, and had not walked in his law, in his statutes, and in his testimonies: therefore did this evil befall you, as it is this day.
024	JER	044	024	And Jeremiah said [farther] to all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of the Lord, all Judah that are in the land of Egypt,
024	JER	044	025	Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouth, and fulfilled with your hands, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto her: ye will fully accomplish your vows, and fully perform your vows.
024	JER	044	026	Therefore hear ye the word of the Lord, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt, Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the Lord, that my name shall no more be called by the mouth of any man of Judah, saying, “As the Lord Eternal liveth,” in all the land of Egypt.
024	JER	044	027	Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall come to their end through the sword and through the famine, until they be destroyed.
024	JER	044	028	Yet some that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, but few in number; and all the remnant of Judah, that are come into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose words shall stand firm, mine, or theirs.
024	JER	044	029	And this shall be unto you the sign, saith the Lord, that I will inflict punishment on you in this place, in order that ye may know that my words shall surely stand firm against you for evil:
024	JER	044	030	Thus hath said the Lord, Behold, I will give Pharaoh-chophra' the king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of those that seek his life, as I gave Zedekiah the king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, his enemy, and who had sought his life.
024	JER	045	001	The word which Jeremiah the prophet spoke unto Baruch the son of Neriyah, when he wrote these words in a book out of the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoyakim the son of Josiah the king of Judah, saying,
024	JER	045	002	Thus hath said the Lord, the God of Israel, concerning thee, O Baruch:
024	JER	045	003	Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for the Lord hath added grief to my pain; I am wearied in my sighing, and rest have I not found;
024	JER	045	004	Thus shalt thou say unto him, Thus hath the Lord said, Behold, what I have built will I pull down, and what I have planted I will pluck up; and so it is with this whole land.
024	JER	045	005	And wouldst thou indeed seek great things for thyself? seek them not; for, behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the Lord; but I will give thy life unto thee as a booty in all the places whither thou mayest go.
024	JER	046	001	The word of the Lord which came to Jeremiah the prophet against the nations:
024	JER	046	002	Concerning Egypt, against the army of Pharaoh-necho the king of Egypt, which was [posted] by the river Euphrates in Karkemish, which Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoyakim the son of Josiah the king of Judah.
024	JER	046	003	Make ye ready shield and buckler, and draw near to the battle.
024	JER	046	004	Harness the horses, and mount, ye horsemen, and stand forth with helmets: sharpen the spears, and put on the coats of mail.
024	JER	046	005	Wherefore have I seen them dismayed, moving backward? while their mighty ones are beaten down, and seek safety in flight, and look not back? There is terror round about, saith the Lord.
024	JER	046	006	The swift cannot flee away, nor can the mighty man escape: toward the north by the shore of the river Euphrates do they stumble and fall.
024	JER	046	007	Who is this that cometh up like a stream, whose waters are upheaved like the rivers?
024	JER	046	008	Egypt cometh up like a stream, and like the rivers are the waters upheaved; and he saith, I will go up, I will cover the land; I will destroy the city and those that dwell therein.
024	JER	046	009	Come up, ye horses; and rush along wildly, ye chariots; and let the mighty men come forth: Cush and Put, that grasp the shield, and the Ludim, that grasp and bend the bow.
024	JER	046	010	And this same day is for the Lord, the Eternal of hosts, a day of vengeance, to be avenged on his adversaries; that the sword may devour, and may be satiated and made drunken with their blood; for there is a sacrifice for the Lord the Eternal of hosts in the north country by the river Euphrates.
024	JER	046	011	Go up into Gil'ad, and fetch balm, O virgin, daughter of Egypt: in vain usest thou many remedies; there is no recovery for thee.
024	JER	046	012	Nations have heard of thy shame, and thy cry of anguish hath filled the earth; for the mighty man over the mighty have they stumbled, together are both of them fallen.
024	JER	046	013	The word which the Lord spoke to Jeremiah the prophet, concerning the coming of Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, to smite the land of Egypt.
024	JER	046	014	Announce ye in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Noph and in Thachpanches: say ye, Stand fast, and prepare thyself; for the sword devoureth round about thee.
024	JER	046	015	Why are thy valiant men swept away? not one hath stood, because the Lord did drive him off.
024	JER	046	016	He caused many to stumble; yea, one also fell over the other; and they said, Arise, and let us return to our own people, and to the land of our birth, from before the wasting sword.
024	JER	046	017	They called out there, Pharaoh is king of Egypt, it was but vaunting, he hath let the time appointed pass by.
024	JER	046	018	As I live, saith the King, the Lord of hosts is his name, Surely as Thabor is among the mountains, and as Carmel is by the sea, so shall he come.
024	JER	046	019	Appurtenances of exile make for thyself, O thou inhabitress, daughter of Egypt; for Noph shall be made a waste and be left desolate without an inhabitant.
024	JER	046	020	O fairest heifer, Egypt! the butcher from the north cometh, he cometh.
024	JER	046	021	Also her hired troops in the midst of her are like fatted calves; for they also are turned round, are fled away together, they do not stand; because the day of their calamity is come upon them, the time of their punishment.
024	JER	046	022	Her cry shall come like [the hissing of] a serpent; for with an army shall they march, and with axes do they come against her, like hewers of wood.
024	JER	046	023	They cut down her forest, saith the Lord, though it cannot be searched out; because they are more than the grasshoppers, and there is no number to them.
024	JER	046	024	Ashamed hath been made the daughter of Egypt: she hath been given up into the hand of the people of the north.
024	JER	046	025	The Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, hath said, Behold, I will send visitation on Ahmon of No, and on Pharaoh, and on Egypt, and on her gods, and on her kings; even on Pharaoh, and on those that trust on him;
024	JER	046	026	And I will give them up into the hand of those that seek their life, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants: and afterward shall she be inhabited, as in the days of old, saith the Lord.
024	JER	046	027	But thou, —fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, and be not dismayed, O Israel; for, behold, I will save thee from afar off, and thy seed from the land of their captivity: and Jacob shall return, and he shall be at rest and at ease, with none to make him afraid.
024	JER	046	028	Thou, —fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith the Lord; for I am with thee: and although I make a full end of all the nations whither I have driven thee, yet of thee will I not make a full end; and I will correct thee in measure; yet wholly will I not leave thee unpunished.
024	JER	047	001	The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines, before the time that Pharaoh smote Gazzah.
024	JER	047	002	Thus hath said the Lord, Behold, waters are coming up out of the north, and they shall become an overflowing stream, and shall overflow the land, and what filleth it; the city, and those that dwell therein: and the men shall cry aloud, and every inhabitant of the land shall wail.
024	JER	047	003	Because of the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his stud-horses, because of the rushing sound of his chariots, the rumbling of his wheels, fathers do not turn round to their children from their feebleness of hands;
024	JER	047	004	Because of the day that cometh to devastate all the Philistines, to cut off from Tyre and Zidon every helper that remaineth; for the Lord devastateth the Philistines, the remnant of the isle of Caphthor.
024	JER	047	005	Baldness is come upon Gazzah; ruined is Ashkelon with the remnant of their valley: how long yet wilt thou cut thyself?
024	JER	047	006	Woe! thou sword of the Lord, how long yet wilt thou not be quiet? withdraw thyself into thy scabbard, take thee rest, and be still.
024	JER	047	007	Yet how canst thou be quiet? When the Lord hath given it a charge, against Ashkelon, and against the sea-coast—thither hath he destined it.
024	JER	048	001	Against Moab. Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Woe unto Nebo! for it is wasted; made ashamed, captured is Kiryathayim; made ashamed is Misgab and dismayed.
024	JER	048	002	There is no more praise of Moab: in Cheshbon have they devised evil against it, “Come, and let us cut it off from being a nation.” Also thou Madmen shalt be ruined; after thee shall pursue the sword.
024	JER	048	003	There is a voice of crying from Choronayim, destruction and a great breach.
024	JER	048	004	Broken down is Moab: her little ones send forth a cry of distress.
024	JER	048	005	For the ascent of Luchith is ascended with weeping and tears; for on the descent of Choronayim the enemies have heard the cry of destruction.
024	JER	048	006	Flee, save your life, and be ye like the solitary tree in the wilderness.
024	JER	048	007	For, because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, thou also shalt be conquered: and Kemosh shall go forth into exile, [with] his priests and his princes together.
024	JER	048	008	And the water shall come over every city, and no city shall escape: and lost shall be the valley, and destroyed shall be the plain, as the Lord hath said.
024	JER	048	009	Give wings unto Moab, that she may flee and get away; since her cities shall become desolate, without any to dwell therein.
024	JER	048	010	Cursed be he that doth the work of the Lord negligently, and cursed be he that withholdeth his sword from blood.
024	JER	048	011	Moab was ever at ease from his youth, and he was resting on his lees, and was not emptied from vessel to vessel, and had not gone into exile: therefore had his taste remained in him, and his scent was not changed.
024	JER	048	012	Therefore, behold, days are coming, saith the Lord, when I will send unto him tappers, that shall tap him, and they shall empty his vessels, and dash in pieces their bottles.
024	JER	048	013	And Moab shall be ashamed of Kemosh, as the house of Israel were made ashamed because of Beth-el their confidence.
024	JER	048	014	How can ye say, We are mighty and men of bravery for the war?
024	JER	048	015	Moab is wasted, and into his cities hath [the enemy] ascended, and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the King, the Lord of hosts is his name.
024	JER	048	016	Near is the calamity of Moab to come, and his misfortune hasteneth fast.
024	JER	048	017	All ye that are about him bemoan him; and all ye that know his name: say, How is the strong staff broken, the beautiful stick!
024	JER	048	018	Come down from thy glory, and sit in thirst, thou inhabitress, daughter of Dibon; for the waster of Moab cometh up against thee, he destroyeth thy strong-holds.
024	JER	048	019	Stand by the way, and look out, O inhabitress of 'Aro'er: ask him that fleeth, and her that escapeth, say, What hath been done?
024	JER	048	020	Moab hath been made ashamed; for it is broken down; wail, and cry aloud: tell ye it by the Arnon, that Moab is wasted,
024	JER	048	021	And punishment is come over the land of the plain, over Cholon, and over Yahzah, and over Mepha'ath,
024	JER	048	022	And over Dibon, and over Nebo, and over Beth-diblathayim,
024	JER	048	023	And over Kiryathayim, and over Beth-gamul, and over Beth-me'on,
024	JER	048	024	And over Keriyoth, and over Bozrah, and over all the cities of the land of Moab, that are far and that are near.
024	JER	048	025	Hewn away is the horn of Moab, and his arm is broken, saith the Lord.
024	JER	048	026	Make him drunken; for he magnified himself against the Lord: and Moab shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall become [an object] of derision.
024	JER	048	027	For was not Israel a derision unto thee? or was he found among thieves? that whenever thou spokest of him, thou hadst to shake [thy head]?
024	JER	048	028	Leave the cities, and dwell on rocks, O ye that dwell in Moab; and be ye like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides of the mouth of rocky clefts.
024	JER	048	029	We have heard the pride of Moab, who is so exceedingly proud, his haughtiness, and his pride, and his arrogance, and the overbearingness of his heart.
024	JER	048	030	I will know, saith the Lord, his wrath, and how causeless it is: his liars have done what is not right.
024	JER	048	031	Therefore will I wail for Moab, and for all Moab will I cry out; for the men of Kir-cheres shall people moan.
024	JER	048	032	With the weeping of Ya'zer will I weep for thee, O vine of Sibmah; thy tendrils [once] passed over the sea, they reached as far as to the sea of Ya'zer: over thy summer-fruits and over thy vintage the waster is fallen.
024	JER	048	033	And banished are joy and gladness from Carmel, and from the land of Moab; and I have caused the wine to cease from the wine-presses; none shall tread the press with the vintner's call; battle cry—nor vintner's call.
024	JER	048	034	From the loud cry of Cheshbon as far as El'aleh, even unto Yahaz, have they sent forth their voice, from Zo'ar even unto Choronayim, to the third 'Eglath; for the waters also of Nimrim shall become desolate.
024	JER	048	035	Moreover will I cause to cease unto Moab, saith the Lord, him that offereth on the high-places, and him that burneth incense to his gods.
024	JER	048	036	Therefore shall my heart groan for Moab like flutes, and my heart shall groan like flutes for the men of Kir-cheres; for the cause that the remnant of the riches he had gotten are lost.
024	JER	048	037	For every head is bald, and every beard is shorn: upon all the hands are cuttings, and upon the loins is sackcloth.
024	JER	048	038	Upon all the roofs of Moab, and in her streets, there is everywhere lamentation; for I have broken Moab like a vessel which hath no value, saith the Lord.
024	JER	048	039	Oh, how is it broken down! wail! how hath Moab turned the back with shame! and Moab shall be a derision and a dismay to all those around him.
024	JER	048	040	For thus hath said the Lord, Behold, as the eagle shall he fly, and he shall spread out his wings over Moab.
024	JER	048	041	Captured are the fortresses, and the strong-holds are conquered: and the heart of the mighty men of Moab shall be on that day as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
024	JER	048	042	And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people; because it hath magnified himself against the Lord.
024	JER	048	043	Terror, and the pit, and the snare, shall be upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith the Lord.
024	JER	048	044	He that fleeth from the terror shall fall into the pit; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be caught in the snare; for I will bring upon it, even upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith the Lord.
024	JER	048	045	Under the shadow of Cheshbon stand still, deprived of strength, those that flee; but a fire cometh forth out of Cheshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sichon, and it devoureth the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the children of vaunting.
024	JER	048	046	Woe unto thee, O Moab! lost is the people of Kemosh; for thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters into captivity.
024	JER	048	047	Yet will I bring back again the captivity of Moab in the end of days, saith the Lord. Thus far is the punishment of Moab.
024	JER	049	001	Against the children of 'Ammon, Thus hath said the Lord, Hath Israel no sons? or hath he no heir? why then doth Malcolm possess Gad, and why do his people dwell in his cities?
024	JER	049	002	Therefore, behold, days are coming, saith the Lord, when I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the children of 'Ammon; and it shall become a desolate heap, and its villages shall be burnt with fire: then shall Israel drive out those that drove them out, saith the Lord.
024	JER	049	003	Wail, O Cheshbon, for 'Ai is wasted; cry aloud, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird yourselves with sackcloth; lament, and roam about among the sheepfolds; for Malcolm shall go into exile, [with] his priest and his princes together.
024	JER	049	004	Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys? thy valley floweth [with blood], O backsliding daughter, that trusted in her treasures, saying, Who can come unto me?
024	JER	049	005	Behold, I will bring terror upon thee, saith the Lord the Eternal of hosts, from all those that are around thee: and ye shall be driven out every man in his own way; and none shall gather up the fugitive.
024	JER	049	006	And afterward will I bring back again the captivity of the children of 'Ammon, saith the Lord.
024	JER	049	007	Concerning Edom, thus hath said the Lord of hosts, Is there no more wisdom in Theman? is counsel vanished from the prudent? is their wisdom become corrupt?
024	JER	049	008	They flee, turn round, seek their abode in deep places, — the inhabitants of Dedan; for the calamity of Esau do I bring upon him, the time when I visit him with punishment.
024	JER	049	009	If grape-gatherers had come to thee, would they not have left some gleanings? if thieves by night, they would destroy only till they had satisfied themselves;
024	JER	049	010	But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret haunts, so that he will not be able to hide himself: his seed is wasted, and his brethren, and his neighbors, and he is no more.
024	JER	049	011	Leave thy fatherless children, I will have to preserve them alive: and thy widows must trust in me.
024	JER	049	012	For thus hath said the Lord, Behold, they whose right it was not to drink the cup have been compelled to drink it, and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink it.
024	JER	049	013	For by myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, that Bozrah shall become an astonishment, a disgrace, a ruin, and a curse; and all its cities shall become perpetual ruins.
024	JER	049	014	A report have I heard from the Lord, and an ambassador is sent among the nations, [saying,] Gather yourselves together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle.
024	JER	049	015	For, lo, I render thee small among the nations, despised among men.
024	JER	049	016	Thy hastiness hath deceived thee, the presumption of thy heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldst make thy nest as high as the eagle, thence would I bring thee down, saith the Lord.
024	JER	049	017	And Edom shall become [an object of] astonishment: every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all its wounds.
024	JER	049	018	Like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighbors, saith the Lord, so shall no man dwell there, nor shall a son of man sojourn therein.
024	JER	049	019	Behold, like a lion will he come up from the overflow of the Jordan against the strong habitation; for I will hasten him, [and] make him suddenly prevail against her; and him who is chosen will I array against her; for who is like me? and who will challenge me to battle? and who is that shepherd that can stand before me?
024	JER	049	020	Therefore hear the counsel of the Lord, that he hath resolved against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath devised against the inhabitants of Theman: Surely the least of the flocks shall drag them away; surely he will devastate over them their habitation.
024	JER	049	021	At the noise of their fall the earth quaketh: [there is] an outcry, —at the Red Sea their voice is heard.
024	JER	049	022	Behold, like the eagle shall he come up and fly along, and spread out his wings over Bozrah: and the heart of the mighty men of Edom shall be on that day as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
024	JER	049	023	Concerning Damascus. Chamath and Arpad are made ashamed; for evil tidings have they heard, they are fainthearted: on the sea there is care, it is not able to be quiet.
024	JER	049	024	Damascus is become feeble, she turneth about to flee, and trembling hath taken hold on her: pangs and throes have seized her, as a woman in travail.
024	JER	049	025	“How is the city of praise not forsaken, the town of my joy!”
024	JER	049	026	Therefore shall her young men fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall perish on that day, saith the Lord of hosts.
024	JER	049	027	And I will kindle a fire on the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of Ben-hadad.
024	JER	049	028	Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Chazor, which Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon smote, thus hath said the Lord, Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and devastate the men of the east.
024	JER	049	029	Their tents and their flocks shall they take away; their curtains, and all their vessels and their camels shall they take to themselves: and they shall call out over them, Terror is on every side.
024	JER	049	030	Flee, fly away far off, seek your abode in deep places, O ye inhabitants of Chazor, saith the Lord; for Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a device against you.
024	JER	049	031	Arise, get you up unto the nation that is at ease, that dwelleth in security, saith the Lord, which hath neither gates nor bars, which dwelleth alone.
024	JER	049	032	And their camels shall become a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter unto all winds those that have the hair cut round; and from all sides will I bring their calamity, saith the Lord.
024	JER	049	033	And Chazor shall become a dwelling for monsters, a desolation for ever: there shall no man dwell there, nor shall a son of man sojourn therein.
024	JER	049	034	The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning 'Elam, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah the king of Judah, saying,
024	JER	049	035	Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, Behold, I will break the bow of 'Elam, the chief of their strength.
024	JER	049	036	And I will bring over 'Elam the four winds from the four quarters of the heavens, and I will scatter them toward all these winds: and there shall not be any nation whither shall not come the outcasts of 'Elam.
024	JER	049	037	For I will cause 'Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before those that seek their life: and I will bring over them evil, the fierceness of my anger, saith the Lord: and I will send out after them the sword, till I have made an end of them.
024	JER	049	038	And I will set up my throne in 'Elam, and I will destroy thence king and princes, saith the Lord.
024	JER	049	039	But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring back again the captivity of 'Elam, saith the Lord.
024	JER	050	001	The word that the Lord spoke concerning Babylon, concerning the land of the Chaldeans, by means of Jeremiah the prophet.
024	JER	050	002	Announce ye among the nations, and publish, and lift up a standard; publish, conceal not; say, Babylon is captured, Bel is put to shame, Merodach is broken in pieces; put to shame are her idols; broken in pieces are her images.
024	JER	050	003	For there is come up against her a nation out of the north, which will change her land into a desert, so that there shall not be any one dwelling therein: both man and beast are fled away, they are departed.
024	JER	050	004	In those days, and at that time, saith the Lord, shall the children of Israel come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping shall they go, and the Lord their God shall they seek.
024	JER	050	005	After Zion shall they ask, with their faces on the way thitherward, [saying,] Come: and they will join themselves to the Lord in a perpetual covenant that shall not be forgotten.
024	JER	050	006	Lost sheep were my people; their shepherds had caused them to go astray, they had let them roam wildly on the mountains: from mountain to hill did they go, they forgot their resting-place.
024	JER	050	007	All that found them devoured them; and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the Lord, the habitation of righteousness, and the hope of their fathers, the Lord.
024	JER	050	008	Fly away out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be ye as the he-goats before the flocks.
024	JER	050	009	For, lo, I will awaken and cause to come up against Babylon an assemblage of great nations from the north country; and they shall set themselves in battle-array against her; from there shall she be captured: their arrows are as those of a skilful mighty one, none of which ever returneth in vain.
024	JER	050	010	And Chaldea shall be given up to spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied, saith the Lord.
024	JER	050	011	Though ye rejoice, though ye be glad, O ye plunderers of my heritage, though ye be grown fat as the heifer at grass, and neigh as stud-horses:
024	JER	050	012	Your mother is made greatly ashamed; she that bore you is put to the blush; behold, the end of nations shall be wilderness, dry land, and desert.
024	JER	050	013	Because of the wrath of the Lord shall it not be inhabited, and it shall be wholly desolate: every one that passeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss over all her wounds.
024	JER	050	014	Put yourselves in battle-array against Babylon round about, all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare not the arrows: for against the Lord hath she sinned.
024	JER	050	015	Shout against her round about; she hath stretched out her hand: fallen are her foundations, thrown down are her walls; for it is the vengeance of the Lord; take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, so do unto her.
024	JER	050	016	Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest; because of the wasting sword shall they turn about every one to his people, and every one to his own land shall they flee.
024	JER	050	017	A scattered lamb is Israel; the lions have driven him away: first the king of Assyria devoured him; and this last one broke his bones, [even] Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon.
024	JER	050	018	Therefore thus hath said the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will inflict punishment on the king of Babylon and on his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria.
024	JER	050	019	And I will bring Israel back again to his habitation, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan: and upon the mountain of Ephraim and Gil'ad shall his soul be satisfied.
024	JER	050	020	In those days, and at that time, saith the Lord, shall the iniquity of Israel be sought for, and it shall not be there; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found; for I will pardon those whom I will leave remaining.
024	JER	050	021	Against the land of twofold rebellion—even against it go thou up, and against the inhabitants of the country of punishment: lay in ruins and utterly destroy their offspring, saith the Lord, and do in accordance with all that I have commanded thee.
024	JER	050	022	A sound of battle [is heard] in the land, and of great destruction.
024	JER	050	023	How is cut asunder and broken the hammer of all the earth! how is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations!
024	JER	050	024	I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also captured, O Babylon, while thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hadst entered into a contest against the Lord.
024	JER	050	025	The Lord hath opened his treasury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation; for it is a work for the Lord, the Eternal of hosts, in the land of the Chaldeans.
024	JER	050	026	Come against her from the end of the earth, open her garners; tread her down as sheaves of corn, and destroy her utterly: let there not be left of her a remnant even.
024	JER	050	027	Destroy all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: Woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation.
024	JER	050	028	There is the voice of those that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to tell in Zion the vengeance of the Lord our God, the vengeance for his temple.
024	JER	050	029	Call together the archers against Babylon; all ye that bend the bow, encamp against her round about; let there be no escape for her: recompense her according to her work; in accordance with all that she hath done, do unto her; for against the Lord hath she acted presumptuously, against the Holy One of Israel.
024	JER	050	030	therefore shall her young men fall in her streets, and all her men of war shall perish on that day, saith the Lord.
024	JER	050	031	Behold, I am against thee, O presumptuous one! saith the Lord, the Eternal of hosts; for thy day is come, the time that I will visit thee [with punishment].
024	JER	050	032	And the presumptuous shall stumble and fall, with none to raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all his environs.
024	JER	050	033	Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, The children of Israel and the children of Judah are oppressed together: and all that took them captive hold them fast; they refuse to dismiss them.
024	JER	050	034	Their Redeemer is strong; The Lord of hosts is his name: he will surely contend in their cause, in order that he may give rest to the land, and make the inhabitants of Babylon tremble.
024	JER	050	035	The sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith the Lord, and against the inhabitants of Babylon, and against her princes, and against her wise men.
024	JER	050	036	The sword is against the lying soothsayers, and they shall be made foolish: the sword is against her mighty men, and they shall be dismayed.
024	JER	050	037	The sword is against their horses, and against their chariots, and against all the confederates that are in the midst of her, and they shall become as women: the sword is against her treasures, and they shall be plundered.
024	JER	050	038	The drought is against her waters, and they shall be dried up; for it is the land of graven images, and with their horrid idols do they play the madman.
024	JER	050	039	Therefore shall martens dwell [there] with jackals, and the ostriches shall dwell therein: and it shall be not inhabited any more for ever; and it shall not be dwelt in from generation to generation.
024	JER	050	040	Like the overthrow by God of Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighbors, saith the Lord, so shall no man dwell there, nor shall any son of man sojourn therein.
024	JER	050	041	Behold, a people cometh from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be awakened from the farthest ends of the earth.
024	JER	050	042	Bow and lance do they firmly grasp; they are cruel, and show not any mercy; their voice roareth like the sea, and upon horses do they ride, placed in array, like one man, for the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon.
024	JER	050	043	The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands are grown feeble: anguish hath taken fast hold of him, pangs as of a woman in travail.
024	JER	050	044	Behold, like a lion shall he come up from the overflow of the Jordan unto the strong habitation; for I will hasten them [and] make them suddenly prevail over her, and him who is chosen will I array against her; for who like me? and who will challenge me to battle? and who is that shepherd that can stand before me?
024	JER	050	045	Therefore hear ye the counsel of the Lord, that he hath resolved against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath devised against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the flock shall drag them away; surely he will devastate over them their habitation.
024	JER	050	046	At the noise of the conquest of Babylon the earth quaketh, and the outcry is heard among the nations.
024	JER	051	001	Thus hath said the Lord, Behold, I will awaken against Babylon, and against those that dwell in the midst of my opponents, a destroying wind;
024	JER	051	002	And I will send out unto Babylon fanners, and they shall fan her, and shall empty out her land; for they shall be against her round about on the day of trouble.
024	JER	051	003	Let the archer come against any one that bendeth his bow, and against him that lifteth himself up in his armor: and spare ye not her young men: destroy ye utterly all her host.
024	JER	051	004	And the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and they that are pierced through, in her streets.
024	JER	051	005	For not widowed are Israel and Judah of their God, of the Lord of hosts; for the land of those was filled with guiltiness against the Holy One of Israel.
024	JER	051	006	Flee ye out of the midst of Babylon, and save ye every man his life: perish not for her iniquity; for this is a time of vengeance unto the Lord; a recompense is he paying out unto her.
024	JER	051	007	A golden cup hath Babylon been in the hand of the Lord, that made drunken all the earth: of her wine have nations drunk; therefore are the nations rendered mad.
024	JER	051	008	Suddenly is Babylon fallen and broken: wail ye for her; fetch balm for her wound, perhaps she may be healed.
024	JER	051	009	“We would have healed Babylon, but she was not healed: forsake her, and let us go every one unto his own country; for her punishment reacheth unto the heavens, and it is lifted up even to the skies.”
024	JER	051	010	The Lord hath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us relate in Zion the work of the Lord our God.
024	JER	051	011	Make bright the arrows; fill the quivers: the Lord hath awakened the spirit of the kings of Media; for against Babylon is his intention, to destroy it; because it is the vengeance of the Lord, the vengeance for his temple.
024	JER	051	012	Against the walls of Babylon lift up the standard, strengthen the watch, set up the watchmen, make ready the ambushes; for the Lord hath both intended and done what he had spoken against the inhabitants of Babylon.
024	JER	051	013	O thou that dwellest upon many waters, great in treasures, thy end is come, the full measure of thy selfish robbery.
024	JER	051	014	Sworn hath the Lord of hosts by himself, Surely I will fill thee with men, as with locusts: and they shall lift up the battle-cry against thee.
024	JER	051	015	He made the earth by his power, he established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding he stretched out the heavens.
024	JER	051	016	At the sound when he giveth a multitude of waters in the heavens, and causeth clouds to ascend from the ends of the earth; when he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures:
024	JER	051	017	Then standeth every man as brutish without knowledge; ashamed is every goldsmith because of the graven image; for falsehood is his molten work, and there is no breath therein.
024	JER	051	018	They are vanity, the work of deception: in the time of their punishment shall they vanish.
024	JER	051	019	Not like these is the portion of Jacob; for He is the former of all things, and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance: The Lord of hosts is his name.
024	JER	051	020	Thou art a hammer unto me, weapons of war; and I strike down with thee nations, and I destroy with thee kingdoms;
024	JER	051	021	And I strike down with thee the horse and his rider; and I strike down with thee the chariot and its rider;
024	JER	051	022	And I strike down with thee man and woman; and I strike down with thee the aged and the lad; and I strike down with thee the young man and the virgin:
024	JER	051	023	And I strike down with thee the shepherd and his flock; and I strike down with thee the husbandman and his yoke of oxen; and I strike down with thee governors and rulers.
024	JER	051	024	But [now] will I repay unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion before your eyes, saith the Lord.
024	JER	051	025	Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, saith the Lord, which destroyest all the earth; and I will stretch out my hand over thee, and I will roll thee down from the rocks, and will render thee a burnt mountain.
024	JER	051	026	And they shall not take from thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but everlasting ruins shalt thou be, saith the Lord.
024	JER	051	027	Lift ye up a standard in the land, blow ye the cornet among the nations, make ready against her nations, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz; appoint against her a commander; cause the horses to come up like the hairy locusts.
024	JER	051	028	Make ready against her the nations with the kings of Media, its governors, and all its rulers, and all the land of their dominion.
024	JER	051	029	And the earth quaketh and trembleth; for every one of the purposes of the Lord is fulfilled against Babylon, to change the land of Babylon into a desolate country without an inhabitant.
024	JER	051	030	The mighty men of Babylon have ceased to fight, they sit still in [their] strongholds; their might is vanished; they are become as women: they have burnt her dwelling-places; her bars are broken.
024	JER	051	031	One runner shall run to meet another runner, and one messenger to meet another messenger, to tell unto the king of Babylon that his city is captured at all ends,
024	JER	051	032	And that the passages have been seized, and that they have burnt the reeds with fire, and that the men of war are affrighted.
024	JER	051	033	For thus hath said the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, the daughter of Babylon is like a threshing-floor, at the time they thresh therein; but yet a little while more, when the time of harvest shall come for her.
024	JER	051	034	“Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon devoured me, he crushed me, he set me down as an empty vessel, he swallowed me up like a huge serpent, he filled his belly with my delicacies: he drove me out.
024	JER	051	035	the violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon,” will the inhabitress of Zion say; and “My blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea,” will Jerusalem say.
024	JER	051	036	Therefore thus hath said the Lord, Behold, I will contend in thy cause, and execute vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea, and cause her springs to fail.
024	JER	051	037	And Babylon shall become ruinous heaps, a dwelling-place for monsters, an astonishment, and a derision, without an inhabitant.
024	JER	051	038	Together like lions shall they roar: they shall yell like the lions' whelps.
024	JER	051	039	When they are heated will I prepare their drinking-feasts, and I will make them drunken, in order that they may be joyful, and [then] sleep a perpetual sleep, and not awake again, saith the Lord.
024	JER	051	040	I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like wethers with he-goats.
024	JER	051	041	How is Sheshach captured! and how is conquered the praise of the whole earth! how is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations!
024	JER	051	042	The sea is come up over Babylon: with the multitude of its waves is she covered.
024	JER	051	043	Her cities are become desolate places, a dry land, and a wilderness, a land wherein not any man shall dwell, and through which no son of man shall pass along.
024	JER	051	044	And I will inflict punishment on Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth what he hath swallowed up out of his mouth; and nations shall not assemble together like a stream unto him any more; yea, the wall of Babylon also is fallen.
024	JER	051	045	Go ye out of the midst of her, my people, and save ye every man his life from the fierceness of the anger of the Lord.
024	JER	051	046	And so that your heart may not faint, and ye fear at the report that is heard in the land: when the report cometh in one year, and after that in another year cometh another report, and when violence [be done] in the land, [by] ruler against ruler.
024	JER	051	047	Therefore, behold, days are coming, when I will inflict punishment on the graven images of Babylon, and her whole land shall be put to shame, and all her slain shall fail in the midst of her.
024	JER	051	048	And then shall the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, sing because of Babylon; for from the north shall come unto her the destroyers, saith the Lord.
024	JER	051	049	Also Babylon is destined to fall, O ye slain ones of Israel, also at Babylon fall the slain of all the land.
024	JER	051	050	[But] ye that have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still: remember afar off the Lord, and let Jerusalem rise up in your heart.
024	JER	051	051	“We had been made ashamed, because we had heard reproach: confusion had covered our faces; because strangers were come into the sanctuaries of the Lord's house.”
024	JER	051	052	Therefore, behold, days are coming, saith the Lord, when I will inflict punishment on her graven images: and through all her land shall groan the deadly wounded.
024	JER	051	053	Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength; yet from me should destroyers come unto her, saith the Lord.
024	JER	051	054	A sound of a painful cry cometh from Babylon, and of a great breach from the land of the Chaldeans;
024	JER	051	055	Because the Lord wasteth Babylon, and destroyeth out of her the loud noise; but their waves roar like great waters, the noise of their voice is sent forth;
024	JER	051	056	Because the destroyer is come over her, over Babylon, and her mighty men are caught, every one of their bows is broken; for the God of recompenses, the Lord, will surely requite.
024	JER	051	057	And I will make drunken her princes, and her wise men, her governors, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not awake again, saith the King, The Lord of hosts is his name.
024	JER	051	058	Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, Every one of the broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly overthrown, and her high gates shall be burnt with fire; so that nations shall have labored in vain, and the people for the fire, and so shall they have wearied themselves.
024	JER	051	059	The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Serayah the son of Neriyah, the son of Machseyah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah unto Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And this Serayah was chief chamberlain.
024	JER	051	060	And Jeremiah wrote down all the evil that should come upon Babylon in one book, namely, all these words that are written concerning Babylon.
024	JER	051	061	And Jeremiah said to Serayah, As thou comest to Babylon, see to it, that thou read all these words;
024	JER	051	062	And thou shalt say, O Lord, thou thyself hast spoken concerning this place, to cut it off, so that there shall not be in it an inhabitant, either man or beast; but that it shall become a desolate place for ever.
024	JER	051	063	And it shall be, when thou hast finished reading this book, that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and throw it into the midst of the Euphrates;
024	JER	051	064	And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise again from the evil that I will bring upon her: and her people shall be wearied. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.
024	JER	052	001	One and twenty years was Zedekiah old when he became king, and eleven years did he reign in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Chamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
024	JER	052	002	And he did what is evil in the eyes of the Lord, in accordance with all that Jehoyakim had done.
024	JER	052	003	For through the anger of the Lord it came to pass against Jerusalem and Judah, till he had cast them out of his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
024	JER	052	004	And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and they encamped against it, and built against it works of attack round about.
024	JER	052	005	So the city was placed in a state of siege until the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
024	JER	052	006	And in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, when the famine was severe in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land:
024	JER	052	007	The city was broken in, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was near the king's garden; [while the Chaldeans were round about the city;] and they went by the way of the plain.
024	JER	052	008	But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and they overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and all his army was scattered from him.
024	JER	052	009	And they caught the king, and they brought him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Chamath: and he called him to account.
024	JER	052	010	And the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: and also all the princes of Judah did he slaughter in Riblah.
024	JER	052	011	And the eyes of Zedekiah did he blind; and the king of Babylon bound him with brazen fetters, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in the ward-house till the day of his death.
024	JER	052	012	And in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, [who] served the king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem.
024	JER	052	013	And he burnt the house of the Lord, and the king's house: and all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great men, did he burn with fire:
024	JER	052	014	And all the walls of Jerusalem round about did all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, pull down.
024	JER	052	015	And certain of the poorest of the people, and the residue of the people that had been left in the city, and the deserters, that had run away to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away into exile.
024	JER	052	016	But certain of the poorest of the land did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard leave for vine-dressers and for husbandmen.
024	JER	052	017	Also the pillars of copper that were in the house of the Lord, and the bases, and the copper sea that was in the house of the Lord, did the Chaldeans break, and they carried off all their copper to Babylon.
024	JER	052	018	And the pots, and the shovels, and the knives, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of copper wherewith they used to perform the service, did they take away.
024	JER	052	019	And the basins, and the censers, and the bowls, and the pots, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the purifying-tubes: of what was of gold the gold, and of what was of silver the silver, did the captain of the guard take away.
024	JER	052	020	The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve copper oxen that served instead of the bases, which king Solomon had made for the house of the Lord: the copper of all these vessels could not be weighed.
024	JER	052	021	And as regardeth the pillars, eighteen cubits was the height of each one pillar; and a thread of twelve cubits would compass it; and its thickness was four fingers: it was hollow.
024	JER	052	022	And a capital was upon it of copper; and the height of the one capital was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the capital round about, all of copper. And the like was the case with the second pillar and the pomegranates.
024	JER	052	023	And the pomegranates were ninety and six on every side: all the pomegranates upon the network were one hundred round about.
024	JER	052	024	And the captain of the guard took Serayah the chief priest, and Zephanyah the priest second in rank, and the three door-keepers;
024	JER	052	025	And out of the city he took a certain court-officer, who had the supervision of the men of war: and seven men of those that had free access to the kings presence, who were found in the city; and the scribe of the chief of the army, who ordered to the army the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city;
024	JER	052	026	And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and led them away unto the king of Babylon to Riblah.
024	JER	052	027	And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Chamath. Thus Judah was carried away into exile out of his own country.
024	JER	052	028	This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away into exile: in the seventh year, three thousand and twenty and three Jews;
024	JER	052	029	In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar from Jerusalem, eight hundred thirty and two persons;
024	JER	052	030	In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away into exile of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons; all the persons were four thousand and six hundred.
024	JER	052	031	And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the exile of Jehoyachin the king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the five and twentieth day of the month that Evil-merodach the king of Babylon in the [first] year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoyachin the king of Judah, and brought him forth out of the prison-house;
024	JER	052	032	And he spoke kindly with him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon,
024	JER	052	033	And he changed his prison-garments: and he ate bread before him continually all the days of his life.
024	JER	052	034	And his allowance was a continual allowance given him by the king, the necessary ration for the day on its day, until the day of his death, all the days of his life.

025	LAM	001	001	Oh how doth she sit solitary—the city that was full of people is become like a widow! she that was so great among the nations, the princess among the provinces, is become tributary!
025	LAM	001	002	She weepeth sorely in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks; she hath none to comfort her among all her lovers; all her friends have dealt treacherously toward her, they are become her enemies.
025	LAM	001	003	Exiled is Judah because of affliction, and because of the greatness of servitude she dwelleth indeed among the nations, she findeth no rest: all her pursuers have overtaken her between the narrow passes.
025	LAM	001	004	The ways to Zion are in mourning, because none come to the solemn feasts; all her gates are desolate; her priests sigh; her virgins moan, and she suffereth herself from bitter grief.
025	LAM	001	005	Her adversaries are become chiefs, her enemies prosper; for the Lord hath caused her to grieve because of the multitude of her transgressions: her babes are gone into captivity before the adversary.
025	LAM	001	006	And there is gone forth from the daughter of Zion all her splendor: her princes are become like harts that have found no pasture, and they flee without strength before the pursuer.
025	LAM	001	007	Jerusalem remembereth in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her magnificent things which have been in the days of old: when her people fell into the hand of the adversary, with none to help her, the adversaries looked at her, they laughed at the cessation [of her glory].
025	LAM	001	008	A grievous sin did Jerusalem commit, therefore is she become a wanderer: all that honored her hold her in contempt, because they have seen her nakedness; she also sigheth, and turneth [ashamed] backward.
025	LAM	001	009	[With] her uncleanness on her skirts, she thought not of her latter end: therefore is she come down wonderfully, without one to comfort her. Behold, O Lord, my affliction; for the enemy hath become great [above me].
025	LAM	001	010	His hand hath the adversary spread out over all her magnificent things; for she hath seen nations entering into her sanctuary, of whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thy congregation.
025	LAM	001	011	all her people sigh, they are seeking bread; they have given their precious things for food to refresh their soul: see, O Lord, and look, how I have been brought low.
025	LAM	001	012	“I adjure you, all that pass this way, behold, and see if there be any pain like unto my pain, which hath been inflicted on me, wherewith the Lord hath aggrieved me on the day of his fierce anger.
025	LAM	001	013	From on high hath he sent a fire into my bones, and breaketh [them] one by one: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath caused me to return backward; he hath made me desolate, sick all the day.
025	LAM	001	014	Bound fast is the yoke of my transgressions by his hand, — they are wreathed, and come up upon my neck; he hath made my strength to stumble: the Lord hath given me up into the hands of [those against whom] I am not able to rise up.
025	LAM	001	015	The Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of me; he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men: a winepress hath the Lord trodden over the virgin, the daughter of Judah.
025	LAM	001	016	For these things do I weep; my eye, my eye runneth down with water; because far from me is the comforter that should refresh my soul: my children are in misery, because the enemy hath prevailed.”
025	LAM	001	017	Zion spreadeth forth her hands, without one to comfort her; the Lord hath given a charge concerning Jacob to all his adversaries round about him: Jerusalem is become as an unclean woman among them.
025	LAM	001	018	“Righteous is the Lord; for against his orders have I rebelled: oh do hear, all ye people, and see my pain! my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.
025	LAM	001	019	I called for my lovers, but they deceived me: my priests and my elders perished in the city; for they sought food for themselves to refresh their soul.
025	LAM	001	020	See, O Lord! how I am in distress; my bowels are heated; my heart is turned round within me; because I have grievously rebelled: abroad bereaveth the sword, at home, like the pestilence.
025	LAM	001	021	They hear how greatly I sigh, [yet] there is none to comfort me; all my enemies have heard of my misfortune, they are glad that thou hast done it: oh that thou wouldst bring the day which thou hast proclaimed [against me], that they may become like me.
025	LAM	001	022	Let all their wickedness come before thee, and do unto them as thou hast done unto me because of all my transgressions; for many are my sighs, and my heart is sick.”
025	LAM	002	001	Oh how hath the Lord covered in his anger the daughter of Zion with a cloud; he hath cast down from heaven unto the earth the ornament of Israel; and he hath not remembered his footstool on the day of his anger!
025	LAM	002	002	The Lord hath destroyed and hath not pitied all the habitation of Jacob: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong-holds of the daughter of Judah: he hath thrown them down to the ground; he hath defiled the kingdom and its princes.
025	LAM	002	003	He hath hewn away in his fierce anger the whole horn of Israel; he hath drawn back his right hand before the enemy; and he burnt against Jacob like a flaming fire, which devoureth round about.
025	LAM	002	004	He bent his bow like an enemy; he held out his right hand as an adversary, and slew all that were pleasant to the eye: in the tent of the daughter of Zion did he pour out like fire his fury.
025	LAM	002	005	The Lord became like an enemy; he destroyed Israel, he destroyed all her palaces, he ruined her strong-holds, and he increased in the midst of the daughter of Judah groaning and wailing.
025	LAM	002	006	And he violently wasted, as if it were a garden, his tabernacle; he destroyed his place of assembly: [yea,] the Lord hath caused to be forgotten in Zion the solemn feast and the day of rest, and hath despised in the indignation of his anger both king and priest.
025	LAM	002	007	The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath made void his sanctuary, he hath surrendered into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces: they have made their voice to resound in the house of the Lord, as on a day of a solemn feast.
025	LAM	002	008	The Lord hath resolved to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion; he stretched out the measuring-line, he withdrew not his hand from destroying: and he caused the rampart and the wall to mourn; together they languish.
025	LAM	002	009	Sunk into the ground are her gates, he hath ruined and broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the nations without any law; her prophets also obtain no more any vision from the Lord.
025	LAM	002	010	The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, they keep silence: they have thrown dust upon their head; they have girt themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem have brought down low their head to the ground.
025	LAM	002	011	My eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are heated, my liver is poured upon the earth because of the breach of the daughter of my people; because babes and sucklings faint away in the streets of the town.
025	LAM	002	012	To their mothers they say, Where is corn and wine? when they faint away like the deadly wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul is poured out on the bosom of their mother.
025	LAM	002	013	What shall I take to witness for thee? what shall I compare unto thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I find equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for great like the sea is thy breach; who can bring healing to thee?
025	LAM	002	014	Thy prophets foresaw for thee vain and deceptive things; and they did not lay open thy iniquity, to cause thy backsliders to return: but they foresaw for thee prophecies of falsehood and seduction.
025	LAM	002	015	All that pass by [this] way clap their hands on account of thee; they hiss and shake their head over the daughter of Jerusalem: [saying,] Is this the city that men called The perfection of beauty. The joy for all the earth?
025	LAM	002	016	All thy enemies open wide their mouth against thee; they hiss and gnash their teeth; they say, We have swallowed her up: ah, truly this is the day that we hoped for; we have found, we have seen it.
025	LAM	002	017	The Lord hath done what he had resolved; he hath accomplished his word which he had ordained already in the days of old; he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied; and he hath caused to rejoice over thee thy enemy, he hath raised on high the horn of thy adversaries.
025	LAM	002	018	Their heart crieth unto the Lord, O thou wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a stream day and night; allow thyself no rest; let not the apple of thy eye be still.
025	LAM	002	019	Arise, complain aloud in the night, in the beginning of the watches; pour out like water thy heart before the face of the Lord: lift up toward him thy hands because of the life of thy babes, that faint away for hunger at the corner of all the streets.
025	LAM	002	020	See, O Lord, and behold! to whom hast thou ever done the like? Shall women, then, eat their own fruit, the babes they have tenderly nursed? or shall there be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord the priest and the prophet?
025	LAM	002	021	There lie down on the ground in the streets the lad and the ancient: my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword: thou hast slain on the day of thy anger; thou hast slaughtered, thou hast not pitied.
025	LAM	002	022	Thou hast called, as it were on a festive day, my evil neighbors from round about; and there was not on the day of the Lord's anger one that escaped or remained: those that I had tenderly nursed and reared up my enemy brought to their end.
025	LAM	003	001	I am the man who hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.
025	LAM	003	002	Me hath he driven out, and led into darkness, but not into light.
025	LAM	003	003	Surely against me doth he turn again and again his hand all the day.
025	LAM	003	004	He hath caused my flesh and my skin to wear out, he hath broken my bones.
025	LAM	003	005	He hath built around me, and encompassed me with poison and hardship.
025	LAM	003	006	In dark places hath he set me to dwell, like the dead of olden times.
025	LAM	003	007	He hath placed a fence round about me, that I cannot get out; he hath made heavy my chain.
025	LAM	003	008	Also when I cry aloud and make entreaty, he shutteth out my prayer.
025	LAM	003	009	He hath fenced up my ways with hewn stone, my paths hath he made crooked.
025	LAM	003	010	A bear lying in wait is he to me, a lion in secret places.
025	LAM	003	011	On my ways hath he placed thorns, and torn me in pieces: he hath made me desolate.
025	LAM	003	012	He hath bent his bow, and placed me as a mark for the arrow.
025	LAM	003	013	He hath caused to enter into my reins the children of his quiver.
025	LAM	003	014	I am become a laughing-stock to all my people, their [jeering] song all the day.
025	LAM	003	015	He hath sated me with bitter things, he hath made me drunken with wormwood.
025	LAM	003	016	He hath also broken my teeth with gravel-stones, he hath covered me with ashes.
025	LAM	003	017	And my soul hath given up all thoughts of peace: I forget happiness.
025	LAM	003	018	And I said, Lost is my strength, my expectation also from the Lord.
025	LAM	003	019	Remembering my affliction and [the cause of] my complaint, wormwood and poison.
025	LAM	003	020	Remembering [this] continually my soul is bowed down deeply within me.
025	LAM	003	021	[Yet] this answer will I give to my heart: therefore will I wait [in confidence].
025	LAM	003	022	It is through the Lord's kindness that we are not consumed, because his mercies have no end;
025	LAM	003	023	They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness.
025	LAM	003	024	The Lord is my portion, saith my soul, therefore will I wait for him.
025	LAM	003	025	The Lord is good unto those that hope in him, to the soul that seeketh him.
025	LAM	003	026	It is good that one should wait and this in silence for the salvation of the Lord.
025	LAM	003	027	It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth;
025	LAM	003	028	That he sit in solitude and be silent; because He hath laid it upon him;
025	LAM	003	029	That he put his mouth in the dust; perhaps there still is hope;
025	LAM	003	030	That he offer his cheek to him that smiteth him; that he be satisfied with reproach.
025	LAM	003	031	For the Lord will not cast off for ever;
025	LAM	003	032	But though he have caused grief, yet will he have mercy according to the abundance of his kindnesses.
025	LAM	003	033	For he doth not afflict of his own will, and aggrieve the children of men.
025	LAM	003	034	To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth,
025	LAM	003	035	To pervert the justice [due to man] before the face of the Most High.
025	LAM	003	036	To subvert a man in his contest—should the Lord not see this?
025	LAM	003	037	Who is he that saith aught, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord hath not ordained it?
025	LAM	003	038	Do not out of the mouth of the Most High come both the evil things and the good?
025	LAM	003	039	Wherefore should a living man complain? let every man complain because of his sins.
025	LAM	003	040	Let us search through and investigate our ways, and let us return to the Lord.
025	LAM	003	041	Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens.
025	LAM	003	042	We have indeed transgressed and rebelled: thou hast truly not pardoned.
025	LAM	003	043	Thou hast covered [us] with thy anger, and made pursuit after us: thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.
025	LAM	003	044	Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that no prayer should pass through.
025	LAM	003	045	As something loathsome and rejected hast thou rendered us in the midst of the people.
025	LAM	003	046	Wide have all our enemies opened against us their mouth.
025	LAM	003	047	Terror and a snare are come upon us, [with] desolation and breaches.
025	LAM	003	048	With streams of water runneth my eye down, because of the breach of the daughter of my people.
025	LAM	003	049	My eye trickleth down, and resteth not, without any intermission,
025	LAM	003	050	Till the Lord look down, and behold from heaven.
025	LAM	003	051	My eye affecteth my soul because of all the daughters of my city.
025	LAM	003	052	Those who are my enemies, without a cause, have chased me about like a bird.
025	LAM	003	053	They have shut up in the dungeon my life, and have cast stones upon me.
025	LAM	003	054	Waters streamed over my head: I said, I am cut off.
025	LAM	003	055	I called on thy name, O Lord, out of the dungeon of the lowest depth.
025	LAM	003	056	Thou didst hear my voice: hide not thy ear to give me enlargement at my cry.
025	LAM	003	057	Thou wast ever near on the day that I called on thee: thou saidst, Fear not.
025	LAM	003	058	Thou didst plead, O Lord, the causes of my soul: thou didst [before this] redeem my life.
025	LAM	003	059	Thou hast [now] seen, O Lord, the wrong I suffer: judge thou my cause.
025	LAM	003	060	Thou hast seen all their vengeance, all their plans against me.
025	LAM	003	061	Thou hast heard their reviling, O Lord, all their plans against me,
025	LAM	003	062	The speeches of these that rise up against me, and their device against me all the day.
025	LAM	003	063	Oh look upon their sitting down, and their rising up: I am their [jeering] song.
025	LAM	003	064	Render unto them a recompense, O Lord, according to the work of their hands.
025	LAM	003	065	Give them confusion of heart, thy curse he upon them.
025	LAM	003	066	Pursue them in anger and destroy from under the heavens of the Lord.
025	LAM	004	001	Oh how is the gold become dim! how is the most fine gold changed! how are the stones of the sanctuary poured out at the corners of every street.
025	LAM	004	002	The precious sons of Zion, valued equal to pure gold, how are they now esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!
025	LAM	004	003	Even wild beasts offer the breast, they give suck to their young ones: the daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.
025	LAM	004	004	The tongue of the suckling cleaveth to its palate by reason of thirst: babes ask for bread, there is not one to break it for them.
025	LAM	004	005	Those that used to eat dainty food are desolate in the streets: they that were reared up on scarlet now embrace dunghills.
025	LAM	004	006	For greater is the iniquity of the daughter of my people than the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as it were in a moment, and no human hands were laid on her.
025	LAM	004	007	Her crowned princes were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more brilliant in body than pearls, more than the sapphire, their countenance:
025	LAM	004	008	Darker than black is now their visage; they are not to be recognized in the streets: their skin is shriveled fast upon their bones; it is dry, it is become like wood.
025	LAM	004	009	Happier are those slain by the sword than those slain by hunger; for those poured forth their blood, being pierced through, —[these perished] without the fruits of the field.
025	LAM	004	010	The hands of merciful women cooked their own children: they became food unto them in the downfall of the daughter of my people.
025	LAM	004	011	The Lord hath let loose all his fury: he hath poured out the fierceness of his anger: and he hath kindled a fire in Zion, which hath devoured her foundations.
025	LAM	004	012	The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not believe that an adversary or an enemy could ever enter within the gates of Jerusalem.
025	LAM	004	013	[But it hath happened] because of the sins of her prophets, the iniquities of her priests, that had shed in the midst of her the blood of the righteous.
025	LAM	004	014	They wandered about blindly in the streets, they became defiled with blood; so that men were not able to touch their garments.
025	LAM	004	015	Depart, ye unclean, they called out unto them: depart, depart, touch not. So they flee away and also wander about: men say among the nations, They shall no more sojourn there.
025	LAM	004	016	The anger of the Lord hath divided them; he will no more look at them: the faces of the priests they respected not, and the elders they spared not.
025	LAM	004	017	Even now our eyes anxiously wait for our valueless help: in our waiting have we waited for a nation that cannot help.
025	LAM	004	018	They hunt our steps, that we cannot walk in our streets: our end is near, our days are full: for our end is come.
025	LAM	004	019	Swifter were our pursuers than the eagles of heaven: upon the mountains did they hotly follow us: in the wilderness did they lie in wait for us.
025	LAM	004	020	The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the Lord, was caught in their pits, he, of whom we said, Under his shadow shall we live among the nations.
025	LAM	004	021	Be glad and rejoice, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of 'Uz: also unto thee shall the cup pass; thou wilt be drunken, and make thyself naked.
025	LAM	004	022	Brought to an end is thy iniquity, O daughter of Zion; He will no more carry thee away into exile: He visiteth thy iniquity, O daughter of Edom; He layeth open thy sins.
025	LAM	005	001	Remember, O Lord, what hath occurred to us, look down, and behold our disgrace.
025	LAM	005	002	Our inheritance is turned over to strangers, our houses to aliens.
025	LAM	005	003	Orphans are we become, and [we are] without a father, our mothers are like widows.
025	LAM	005	004	Our water have we drunk for money: our wood cometh to us for a purchase price.
025	LAM	005	005	Up to our necks are we pursued: we are fatigued, and no rest is allowed us.
025	LAM	005	006	To Egypt do we stretch out our hand, to Asshur, to be satisfied with bread.
025	LAM	005	007	Our fathers have sinned, and are no more; but we have indeed to bear their iniquities.
025	LAM	005	008	Servants rule over us: no one delivereth us out of their hand.
025	LAM	005	009	At the peril of our life must we bring home our bread, because of the sword of the wilderness.
025	LAM	005	010	Our skin gloweth like an oven, because of the heat of famine.
025	LAM	005	011	Women have they ravished in Zion, virgins, in the cities of Judah.
025	LAM	005	012	Princes were hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not honored.
025	LAM	005	013	Young men they bore to the mill, and boys stumbled under the wood.
025	LAM	005	014	The elders have ceased from the gate, young men, from their singing.
025	LAM	005	015	Ceased hath the joy of our heart: our dance is changed into mourning.
025	LAM	005	016	Fallen is the crown of our head: woe to us, for we have sinned.
025	LAM	005	017	Because of this is our heart made sick; for these things are our eyes dimmed;
025	LAM	005	018	Because of the mount of Zion which is wasted, foxes walk about on it.
025	LAM	005	019	O thou, Lord, wilt truly abide for ever, thy throne existeth throughout all generations.
025	LAM	005	020	Wherefore wilt thou forget us for ever! wilt thou forsake us for so long a time?
025	LAM	005	021	Cause us to return, O Lord, unto thee, and we will return: renew our days as of old.
025	LAM	005	022	For wouldst thou entirely reject us, be wroth with us to the uttermost?

# BOOK	026	EZE	Ezekiel	Ezekiel
026	EZE	001	001	And it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I was in the midst of the exiles by the river Kebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw divine visions.
026	EZE	001	002	On the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of the exile of king Jehoyachin,
026	EZE	001	003	Came the word of the Lord expressly unto Ezekiel the son of Buzi, the priest, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Kebar; and there came upon him there the inspiration of the Lord.
026	EZE	001	004	And I saw, and behold, a storm-wind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a flaming fire, and a brightness was on it round about; and out of the midst of it was like the glitter of amber, out of the midst of the fire.
026	EZE	001	005	And out of the midst thereof [I saw] the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: They had the likeness of a man.
026	EZE	001	006	And every one had four faces, and every one of them had four wings.
026	EZE	001	007	And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the glitter of burnished copper.
026	EZE	001	008	And hands of man [were visible] from beneath their wings on their four sides: and their faces and their wings [were alike] on all these four.
026	EZE	001	009	Their wings were joined one to the other: they turned not about in their going; they went every one in the direction of one of their faces.
026	EZE	001	010	And the likeness of their faces was the face of a man; and the face of a lion, on the right side for all four of them; and the face of an ox on the left side for all four of them; and the face of an eagle for all four of them.
026	EZE	001	011	Thus were their faces: and their wings were spread out upward; every one had two joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.
026	EZE	001	012	And they went every one in the direction of one of his faces: whither the spirit was directed to go, they went; they turned not about in their going.
026	EZE	001	013	As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like coals of fire, burning as with the appearance of torches; this [fire] it was which passed along between the living creatures: and a brightness was about the fire, and out of the fire went forth lightning.
026	EZE	001	014	And the living creatures ran backward and forward like the appearance of a flash of lightning.
026	EZE	001	015	And I looked on the living creatures, and, behold, there was one wheel upon the earth close by the living creatures, by their four front faces.
026	EZE	001	016	The appearance of the wheels and their work was like the color of a chrysolite; and all four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as though it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.
026	EZE	001	017	Toward their four sides they went in their going: they turned not round in their going.
026	EZE	001	018	As for their circumferences, they were so high that they excited fear: and their felloes were full of eyes round about on all these four.
026	EZE	001	019	And when the living creatures went, the wheels went near to them: and when the living creatures lifted themselves up from the earth, the wheels lifted themselves up.
026	EZE	001	020	Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went; [for] thither was [their] spirit to go: and the wheels lifted themselves up at the same time with them; for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
026	EZE	001	021	When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those lifted themselves up from the earth, the wheels lifted themselves up at the same time with them; for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
026	EZE	001	022	And the likeness of a vault was over the head of the living creatures, [shining] like the glitter of the purest crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.
026	EZE	001	023	And under the vault their wings were straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered them, and every one had two, which covered them, —[namely,] their bodies.
026	EZE	001	024	And I heard the sound of their wings, like the sound of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, when they went, the sound of [their] speech, as the noise of an army: when they stood still, they let down their wings.
026	EZE	001	025	And there was a voice from the vault that was over their head: when they stood still, they let down their wings.
026	EZE	001	026	And above the vault that was over their head was like the appearance of a sapphire-stone, the likeness of a throne: and upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.
026	EZE	001	027	And I saw as if it were the glitter of amber, as the appearance of fire within it round about, from the appearance of his loins upward; and from the appearance of his loins downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.
026	EZE	001	028	Like the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud on the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about: this was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard the voice of one that spoke.
026	EZE	002	001	And he said unto me, Son of man, stand up upon thy feet, and I will speak with thee.
026	EZE	002	002	And a spirit entered into me as he spoke unto me, and it placed me upon my feet, and I heard him that spoke unto me.
026	EZE	002	003	And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to rebellious tribes that have rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even until this very day.
026	EZE	002	004	And the children are impudent of face, and obdurate of heart: I send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	002	005	And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, [for they are a rebellious family,] shall yet know that a prophet hath been among them.
026	EZE	002	006	And thou, son of man, —thou shalt not be afraid of them, and of their words thou shalt have no fear, though they be briers and thorns with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: of their words be not afraid, and at their presence be not dismayed; for they are a rebellious family.
026	EZE	002	007	And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear; for they are rebellious.
026	EZE	002	008	But thou, son of man, hear what I am speaking unto thee, Be not thou rebellious like this rebellious family: open thy mouth, and eat what I give unto thee.
026	EZE	002	009	And then I looked, and behold, a hand was stretched out toward me; and, lo, a roll-book was therein;
026	EZE	002	010	And he spread it out before me; and it was written within and without: and there were written therein lamentations, and dirges, and woe.
026	EZE	003	001	And he said unto me, Son of man, eat what thou findest: eat this roll, and go, speak unto the house of Israel.
026	EZE	003	002	So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat this roll.
026	EZE	003	003	And he said unto me, Son of man, feed thy belly, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I am giving unto thee. And I ate it; and it was in my mouth like honey in sweetness.
026	EZE	003	004	And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.
026	EZE	003	005	For not to a people of an obscure speech and of a difficult tongue art thou sent, but to the house of Israel;
026	EZE	003	006	Not to many people of an obscure speech and of a difficult tongue, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would truly have hearkened unto thee.
026	EZE	003	007	But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me; for all the house of Israel have a bold forehead, and a hard heart.
026	EZE	003	008	Behold, I have made thy face strong against their face, and thy forehead strong against their forehead.
026	EZE	003	009	As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: thou shalt not fear them, nor shalt thou be dismayed at their presence, though they be a rebellious family.
026	EZE	003	010	And he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I will speak unto thee receive in thy heart, and hear [them] with thy ears.
026	EZE	003	011	And go, get thee to those in exile, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal: whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.
026	EZE	003	012	Then a spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, [saying,] Blessed be the glory of the Lord from his place.
026	EZE	003	013	[I heard] also the sound of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the sound of the wheels at the same time with them, and the sound of a great rushing.
026	EZE	003	014	So a spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I walked in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit, and the inspiration of the Lord was strong upon me.
026	EZE	003	015	Then came I to the exiles at Tel-abib, who dwelt by the river Kebar, and I remained where they dwelt, and I remained there in a state of confusion among them seven days.
026	EZE	003	016	And it came to pass at the end of seven days, That the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	003	017	Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: and thou shalt hear the word out of my mouth, and give them warning from me.
026	EZE	003	018	When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou dost not give him warning, and speakest not to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life: the same wicked man shall die through his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thy hand.
026	EZE	003	019	But thou, —if thou hast warned the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way: he shall indeed die in his iniquity; but thou hast surely delivered thy soul.
026	EZE	003	020	Again, When a righteous man do turn from his righteousness, and do what is wrong: then will I lay a stumbling-block before him, [so that] he shall die; yet if thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his acts of righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require from thy hand.
026	EZE	003	021	But if thou hast truly warned him, —the righteous, that the righteous should not sin, and he doth not sin: he shall surely live, because he attended to the warning, and thou hast surely delivered thy own soul.
026	EZE	003	022	And the inspiration of the Lord came there over me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the valley, and there will I speak with thee.
026	EZE	003	023	And I arose, and went forth into the valley; and, behold, there was the glory of the Lord standing, like that glory which I had seen by the river Kebar: and I fell down on my face.
026	EZE	003	024	Then entered a spirit into me, and placed me upright on my feet, and spoke with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself up within thy house.
026	EZE	003	025	But thou, O son of man, behold, they put ropes upon thee, and bind thee with them, that thou canst not go out among them:
026	EZE	003	026	And I will let thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not become to them a man who reproveth; for they are a rebellious family.
026	EZE	003	027	But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forebear; for they are a rebellious family.
026	EZE	004	001	But thou, O son of man, take thyself a tile, and lay it before thee, and engrave upon it a city, [namely,] Jerusalem:
026	EZE	004	002	And place around it a siege, and build works of attack against it, and cast up a mound against it; and arrange around it encampments, and place against it battering rams round about.
026	EZE	004	003	Moreover take thou unto thyself an iron pan, and set it up as a wall of iron between thee and the city: and direct thy face against it, that it may be placed in a state of siege, and lay siege against it. This shall be a sign for the house of Israel.
026	EZE	004	004	And as for thyself, lie upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: [after] the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it shalt thou bear their iniquity.
026	EZE	004	005	But as for myself, I lay upon thee the years of their iniquity, after the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.
026	EZE	004	006	And when thou hast made an end of them, thou shalt lie on thy right side, the second time, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: a day each for a year, a day for a year do I lay it on thee.
026	EZE	004	007	And toward the siege of Jerusalem shalt thou direct thy face with thy arm uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it.
026	EZE	004	008	And, behold, I will lay ropes upon thee, that thou mayest not turn thyself from one side to the other, till thou hast made an end of the days of thy siege.
026	EZE	004	009	But thou take unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentiles, and millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel, and make thyself bread thereof, [after] the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, three hundred and ninety days, shalt thou eat it.
026	EZE	004	010	And thy food which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels for every day: from one time to the other time shalt thou eat it.
026	EZE	004	011	And water shalt thou drink by measure, the sixth part of a hin: from one time to the other time shalt thou drink [it].
026	EZE	004	012	And in form of a barley-cake shalt thou eat it, and this shalt thou bake with balls of human excrement before their eyes.
026	EZE	004	013	And the Lord said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their bread unclean among the nations whither I will drive them.
026	EZE	004	014	Then said I, Ah Lord Eternal! behold, my soul hath not been defiled; and that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces, have I never eaten from my youth up even until now; and never is flesh of abomination come into my mouth.
026	EZE	004	015	Then said he unto me, Lo, I have given thee cow's dung instead of human excrement; and thou shalt prepare thy bread thereupon.
026	EZE	004	016	And he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem; and they shall eat bread by weight, and with anxious care; and they shall drink water by measure, and in confusion;
026	EZE	004	017	In order that they may want bread and water, and be confounded one with the other, and pine away for their iniquity.
026	EZE	005	001	And thou, son of man, take unto thyself a sharp sword, a barber's razor shalt thou take for it unto thyself, and cause it to pass over thy head and over thy beard: then take unto thee balances for weighing, and divide the hair.
026	EZE	005	002	One third part shalt thou burn with fire in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are completed; and thou shalt take another third part, and smite [it] round about it with the sword; and the other third part shalt thou scatter to the wind: and I will draw out a sword after the same.
026	EZE	005	003	And take thence a few in number, and tie them up in the corners of thy garment.
026	EZE	005	004	And from these again shalt thou take some, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire: therefrom shall a fire go forth unto all the house of Israel.
026	EZE	005	005	Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, This is Jerusalem, which I had set it in the midst of the nations and countries that are round about her.
026	EZE	005	006	But she rebelled against my ordinances more wickedly than the nations, and against my statutes, more than the countries that are round about her; for my ordinances they have despised, and as for my statutes, they have not walked in them.
026	EZE	005	007	Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Because ye have given yourselves up to evil more than the nations that are round about you, have not walked in my statutes, and have not executed my ordinances, and not even acted according to the ordinances of the nations that are round about you:
026	EZE	005	008	Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I, also I am against thee, and I will execute judgments in the midst of thee before the eyes of the nations.
026	EZE	005	009	And I will do in thee that which I have never done, and the like of which I will never do any more, because of all thy abominations.
026	EZE	005	010	Therefore fathers shall devour their children in the midst of thee, and children shall devour their fathers: and I will execute judgments on thee, and I will scatter all thy remnant unto all the winds.
026	EZE	005	011	Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord Eternal, Surely, because thou hast made unclean my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thy abominations: therefore will I also diminish [thee]; and my eye shall not show pity, and I also will not spare.
026	EZE	005	012	A third part of thee shall die through the pestilence, and come through famine to their end in the midst of thee; and another third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and the other third part will I scatter unto all the winds, and a sword will I draw out after them.
026	EZE	005	013	Thus shall my anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will satisfy myself: and they shall know that I the Lord have spoken it in my zeal, when I have let out all my fury on them.
026	EZE	005	014	Yea, I will render thee a ruin, and a disgrace among the nations that are round about thee, before the eyes of every one that passeth by.
026	EZE	005	015	And she shall be a disgrace and a taunt, a warning and an astonishment unto the nations that are round about thee, when I execute judgments on thee in anger and in fury and in furious chastisements, —I the Lord have spoken it, —
026	EZE	005	016	When I send out among them the dreadful arrows of famine, which [ever] were the cause of destruction, which I will send out to destroy you; and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break unto you the staff of bread:
026	EZE	005	017	So will I let loose over you famine and wild beasts, and they shall make thee childless; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and the sword will I bring over thee. I the Lord have spoken it.
026	EZE	006	001	And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	006	002	Son of man, set thy face against the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,
026	EZE	006	003	And thou shalt say, O mountains of Israel, hear ye the word of the Lord Eternal! Thus hath said the Lord Eternal to the mountains, and to the hills, to the brooks, and to the valleys, Behold, I, even I, will bring over you the sword, and I will destroy your high-places.
026	EZE	006	004	And your altars shall be made desolate, and your sun-images shall be broken: and I will cause your slain ones to fall before your idols.
026	EZE	006	005	And I will lay the carcasses of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.
026	EZE	006	006	In all your dwelling-places the cities shall be laid in ruins, and the high-places shall be made desolate; in order that your altars may be laid in ruins and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and annihilated, and your sun-images may be cut down, and your works may be blotted out.
026	EZE	006	007	And the slain shall fall in the midst of you: and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	006	008	Yet will I leave [some]; that ye shall have some that escape the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered in the [various] countries.
026	EZE	006	009	And those of you that escape shall remember me among the nations among whom they shall have been carried captive, when I shall have broken their licentious heart, which had departed from me, even with their eyes, which were gone astray after their idols: and they shall loathe themselves on account of the evil deeds which they have committed with all their abominations.
026	EZE	006	010	And they shall know that I am the Lord: not for naught have I spoken that I would do unto them this evil.
026	EZE	006	011	Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Strike thy hands together, and stamp with thy foot, and say, Alas for all the dreadful abominations of the house of Israel! who will have to fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.
026	EZE	006	012	He that is afar off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine: thus will I let out all my fury on them.
026	EZE	006	013	And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when their slain ones shall lie in the midst of their idols round about their altars, on every high hill, upon all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick-branched oak, —places where they presented sweet savor to all their idols.
026	EZE	006	014	And I will stretch out my hand over them, and I will render the land desolate and waste, more than the wilderness toward Diblath, in all their habitations: and they shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	007	001	And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	007	002	And thou, son of man, thus hath said the Lord Eternal concerning the land of Israel, There is an end! the end is coming over the four corners of the land.
026	EZE	007	003	Now cometh the end over thee, and I will let loose my anger against thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and I will lay upon thee all thy abominations.
026	EZE	007	004	And my eye shall not show pity upon thee, and I will not spare thee; for thy own ways will I lay upon thee, and thy abominations shall come in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	007	005	Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, An evil, a peculiar evil, behold, is coming.
026	EZE	007	006	An end is coming, there is coming the end: it waketh up against thee; behold, [the evil] cometh.
026	EZE	007	007	The evil decree is come against thee, O thou inhabitant of the land: the time is come, near is the day of tumult, and not the joyful call on the mountains.
026	EZE	007	008	Now will I in a short time pour out my fury over thee, and I will let out all my anger against thee, and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and I will lay upon thee all thy abominations.
026	EZE	007	009	And my eye shall not show pity, and I will not spare: according to thy ways will I lay [evil] on thee, and thy abominations shall come in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am the Lord that smiteth.
026	EZE	007	010	Behold the day, behold, it is coming; the evil decree is gone forth; the staff hath blossomed, presumption hath budded;
026	EZE	007	011	The violence is grown up into the staff of wickedness: nothing is left of them, and nothing of their multitude, and nothing of theirs; and there shall be no lamenting for them.
026	EZE	007	012	The time is coming, the day occurreth; let the buyer not rejoice, and let the seller not mourn; for wrath is against all her multitude.
026	EZE	007	013	For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although their soul were yet alive; for the vision is against all her multitude; no one shall return; but the soul of every one is fastened to his iniquity, they do not strengthen themselves [to repent].
026	EZE	007	014	They have blown the cornet, every one maketh himself ready; but no one goeth to the battle; for my wrath is against all her multitude.
026	EZE	007	015	The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine are within: he that is in the field shall die by the sword; and he that is in the city, him shall famine and pestilence devour.
026	EZE	007	016	But they that escape of them shall escape, and they shall be on the mountains like the doves of the valleys, all of which are moaning, every one in his iniquity.
026	EZE	007	017	All hands become feeble, and all knees go into water.
026	EZE	007	018	And people gird themselves with sackcloth, and shuddering covereth them: and upon all faces there is shame, and upon all their heads there is baldness.
026	EZE	007	019	Their silver shall they cast into the streets, and their gold shall be as though it were unclean: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them on the day of the wrath of the Lord; they shall not satisfy their souls, and not fill their bowels; because it was the stumbling-block for their iniquity.
026	EZE	007	020	And as for the beauty of his ornament, which he had instituted for [their] pride: even therein did they make the images of their abominations, their detestable things; therefore have I rendered it unclean for them.
026	EZE	007	021	And I will give it up into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil: and they shall pollute it.
026	EZE	007	022	And I will turn away my face from them, and they shall pollute my place where I dwelt in secret; and therein shall barbarians enter and pollute it.
026	EZE	007	023	Make chains; for the land is full of blood-guiltiness, and the city is full of violence.
026	EZE	007	024	Therefore will I bring the worst of nations, and they shall take possession of their houses: I will also cause the pride of the mighty to cease; and their holy places shall be polluted.
026	EZE	007	025	Destruction cometh: and they will seek peace, but there shall be none.
026	EZE	007	026	Mishap shall come upon mishap, and report shall be spread upon report: and then will they seek a vision from the prophet; but the law shall be lost from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.
026	EZE	007	027	The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with distress, and the hands of the people of the land shall be powerless: after their way will I do unto them, and according to their own manners will I judge them; and they shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	008	001	And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, that I was sitting in my house, and the elders of Judah were sitting before me; and there fell upon me there the inspiration of the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	008	002	And I saw, and, behold, there was a likeness similar to the appearance of fire; from the appearance of his loins downward, it was fire; and from his loins upward, it was similar to the appearance of a bright light, like the glitter of amber.
026	EZE	008	003	And he stretched forth the form of a hand, and took me by the locks of my head; and a spirit bore me between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north, where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to wrath.
026	EZE	008	004	And, behold, there was the glory of the God of Israel, like the appearance which I had seen in the valley.
026	EZE	008	005	And he said unto me, Son of man, do but lift up thy eyes in the direction toward the north. So I lifted up my eyes in the direction toward the north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar [there was] this image of jealousy at the entrance.
026	EZE	008	006	Then said he unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they are doing? great abominations are they that the house of Israel commit here, to make me go far away from my sanctuary; but thou shalt yet see still other great abominations.
026	EZE	008	007	And he brought me to the door of the court: and I looked, and behold there was a hole in the wall.
026	EZE	008	008	Then said he unto me, Son of man, do break [an opening] in the wall: and I broke [an opening] in the wall, and, behold, there was a door.
026	EZE	008	009	And he said unto me, Go in, and see the wicked abominations which they are doing here.
026	EZE	008	010	So I went in and saw; and behold there was every form of creeping things, and cattle, abominations, and all the idols of the house of Israel, engraven upon the wall all round about.
026	EZE	008	011	And seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, and Yaazanyahu the son of Shaphan standing in the midst of them, were standing before them, and every man had his censer in his hand; and a thick curling cloud of incense was ascending upward.
026	EZE	008	012	Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the dark, every man in his image-chambers? for they say, The Lord seeth us not: the Lord hath forsaken the earth.
026	EZE	008	013	And he said unto me, Thou shalt yet again see still other great abominations that they are doing.
026	EZE	008	014	And he brought me to the entrance of the gate of the Lord's house which was on the north side: and, behold, there sat the women weeping for Thammuz.
026	EZE	008	015	Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Thou shalt yet again see still other greater abominations than these.
026	EZE	008	016	And he brought me into the inner court of the Lord's house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the Lord, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the Lord, and their faces toward the east; and they were prostrating themselves eastward to the sun.
026	EZE	008	017	Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Is it too light a thing for the house of Judah to commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and they constantly repeat to provoke me to anger; and, lo, they stretch forth the branch to their nose.
026	EZE	008	018	Therefore I also will deal in fury; my eye shall not look with pity, and I will not spare: and though they call before my ears with a loud voice, will I still not hear them.
026	EZE	009	001	And he called before my ears with a loud voice, saying, Let those come near that have charge to punish the city, and every man with his destroying weapon in his hand.
026	EZE	009	002	And, behold, six men came from the direction of the upper gate, which is turned toward the north, and every man with his weapon of destruction in his hand; and one man in the midst of them was clothed in linen, with a writer's materials by his side: and they went in, and placed themselves beside the copper altar.
026	EZE	009	003	And the glory of the God of Israel ascended up from the cherub, whereupon it had been, to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed in linen, who had the writer's materials by his side.
026	EZE	009	004	And the Lord said unto him, Pass through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and inscribe a mark upon the foreheads of the men who sigh and who complain because of all the abominations which are done in the midst of it.
026	EZE	009	005	And to the others he said before my ears, Pass ye through the city after him, and smite: let your eye not look with pity, and do not spare;
026	EZE	009	006	The aged, youth, and virgin, and little children, and women shall ye slay and destroy; but come not near any man upon whom the mark is; and at my sanctuary shall ye begin. Then they began with the ancient men who were before the house.
026	EZE	009	007	And he said unto them, Make unclean the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go forth. And they went forth, and they smote in the city.
026	EZE	009	008	And it came to pass, while they were smiting them, and I alone was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried out, and said, Ah Lord Eternal! wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel when thou pourest out thy fury over Jerusalem?
026	EZE	009	009	Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and of Judah is exceedingly great, and the land is full of blood-guiltiness, and the city full of injustice; for they have said, The Lord hath forsaken the land, and the Lord seeth not.
026	EZE	009	010	And as for me also, my eye shall not look with pity, and I will not spare; but I will bring their course upon their own head.
026	EZE	009	011	And, behold, the man clothed in linen, who had the writing materials by his side, brought back word, saying, I have done according to all that thou hast commanded me.
026	EZE	010	001	Then I saw, and, behold, on the vault that was above the head of the cherubim, there appeared over them something like a sapphire stone, something similar in appearance to the likeness of a throne.
026	EZE	010	002	And he said unto the man clothed in linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, under the cherub, and fill thy hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and throw [them] over the city. And he went in before my eyes.
026	EZE	010	003	Now the cherubim were standing on the right side of the house, when the man went in: and the cloud filled the inner court.
026	EZE	010	004	Then the glory of the Lord rose upward from the cherub, toward the threshold of the house: and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the Lord's glory.
026	EZE	010	005	And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard as far as the outer court, like the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh.
026	EZE	010	006	And it came to pass, when he commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubim, that he went in, and stood beside the wheel.
026	EZE	010	007	And the one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim unto the fire that was between the cherubim, and lifted it up, and placed it into the hands of the one clothed in linen; who took it, and went out.
026	EZE	010	008	And there became visible on the cherubim the form of a man's hand beneath their wings.
026	EZE	010	009	And I saw, and, behold, there were four wheels by the cherubim, one wheel by the one cherub, and another wheel by the other cherub: and the appearance of the wheels was like the glitter of a chrysolite stone.
026	EZE	010	010	And as for their appearances, the whole four had one likeness, as if a wheel were in the midst of another wheel.
026	EZE	010	011	In their going, they went toward their four sides, they turned not round in their going; but to the place whither the head was turned they followed it, they turned not round in their going.
026	EZE	010	012	And their whole body, and their back, and their hands, and their wings, as also the wheels, were full of eyes round about, [even] the wheels that belonged to all four of them.
026	EZE	010	013	As for the wheels, they were called Galgal before my ears.
026	EZE	010	014	And every one had four faces: the one face was the face of a cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third face was the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.
026	EZE	010	015	And the cherubim lifted themselves up. This is the living creature that I saw by the river Kebar.
026	EZE	010	016	And when the cherubim went forward, the wheels went close by them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels also did not turn away from beside them.
026	EZE	010	017	When those halted, these halted; and when those lifted themselves up, these lifted themselves up with them; for the spirit of the living creature was in them.
026	EZE	010	018	And the glory of the Lord went forth from off the threshold of the house, and halted over the cherubim.
026	EZE	010	019	And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth before my eyes as they went forth, and the wheels at the same time with them, and halted at the entrance of the east gate of the house of the Lord: and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.
026	EZE	010	020	This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Kebar; and I understood that they were cherubim.
026	EZE	010	021	Every one had four faces apiece, and every one had four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.
026	EZE	010	022	And the likeness of their faces was the same as the faces which I had seen by the river Kebar, their appearances and themselves: they went every one in the direction of his face.
026	EZE	011	001	And a spirit bore me up, and brought me unto the east gate of the house of the Lord, which looketh eastward: and behold, there were at the entrance of the gate five and twenty men; and I saw in the midst of them Yaazanyah the son of 'Azzur, and Pelatyahu the son of Benayahu, princes of the people.
026	EZE	011	002	Then said he unto me, Son of man, these are the men that devise wickedness, and give evil counsel in this city;
026	EZE	011	003	Who say, [The evil] is not near; so let us build houses: this [city] is the pot, and we are the flesh.
026	EZE	011	004	Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.
026	EZE	011	005	And the Spirit of the Lord fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak, Thus hath said the Lord, Thus have ye said, O house of Israel; and whatever cometh into your mind, do I know full well.
026	EZE	011	006	Ye have multiplied those slain by you in this city, and ye have filled its streets with the slain.
026	EZE	011	007	Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Those slain by you whom ye have struck down in the midst of it, —they are the flesh, and this place is the pot; but you are to be removed out of the midst of it.
026	EZE	011	008	The sword have ye feared: and the sword will I bring over you, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	011	009	And I will remove you out of the midst of it, and I will give you up into the hand of strangers, and will execute punishments among you.
026	EZE	011	010	By the sword shall ye fall; on the boundary of Israel will I judge you: and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	011	011	This place shall not be unto you as a pot, so that you should be as flesh in the midst of it; but on the boundary of Israel will I judge you.
026	EZE	011	012	And ye shall know that I am the Lord: because in my statutes have ye not walked, and my ordinances have ye not executed; but ye have done after the ordinances of the nations that are round about you.
026	EZE	011	013	And it came to pass, as I was prophesying, that Pelatyahu the son of Benayah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord Eternal! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?
026	EZE	011	014	Then came the word of the Lord unto me, saying,
026	EZE	011	015	Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and the whole house of Israel altogether, are they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Remain you far from the Lord: unto us is this land given for a possession.
026	EZE	011	016	Therefore say, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Although I have removed them far away among the nations, and although I have scattered them among the countries: yet will I be to them as a minor sanctuary in the countries whither they are come.
026	EZE	011	017	Therefore say, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, I will both gather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries whether ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.
026	EZE	011	018	And they shall come thither, and they shall remove all its detestable things, and all its abominations out of it.
026	EZE	011	019	And I will give them one single heart, and a new spirit will I put within you; and I will remove the heart of stone out of their body, and I will give unto them a heart of flesh:
026	EZE	011	020	In order that they may walk in my statutes, and keep my ordinances, and do them; and they shall be unto me for a people, and I will indeed be unto them for a God.
026	EZE	011	021	But as for those whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, their way do I bring upon their own head, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	011	022	Then did the cherubim lift up their wings, and the wheels at the same time with them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.
026	EZE	011	023	And the glory of the Lord ascended from the midst of the city, and halted upon the mount which is on the east side of the city.
026	EZE	011	024	But a spirit bore me up, and brought me into Chaldea, to those in exile, in the appearance through the spirit of God: and then ascended away from me the appearance which I had seen.
026	EZE	011	025	Then did I speak unto those in exile all the things that the Lord had shown me.
026	EZE	012	001	The word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	012	002	Son of man, in the midst of a rebellious family art thou dwelling, who have eyes to see, and see not; who have ears to hear, and hear not; for they are a rebellious family.
026	EZE	012	003	But thou, O son of man, prepare for thyself vessels for going into exile, and wander away by day before their eyes; and thou shalt wander away from thy place to another place before their eyes: perhaps they may become aware that they are a rebellious family.
026	EZE	012	004	Then shalt thou carry forth thy vessels, like vessels of exile, by day before their eyes: and thou shalt go forth at evening before their eyes, as they do that go forth into exile.
026	EZE	012	005	Before their eyes break a hole through the wall, and carry [them] through it.
026	EZE	012	006	Before their [eyes] shalt thou bear them upon thy shoulders, in the dark shalt thou carry them forth: thy face shalt thou cover, that thou mayest not see the ground; for as a token have I set thee unto the house of Israel.
026	EZE	012	007	And I did so as I had been commanded; my vessels I carried forth by day, like vessels of exile, and in the evening I broke a hole for myself through the wall with my hand: in the dark I brought them forth, and I bore them upon my shoulder before their eyes.
026	EZE	012	008	And the word of the Lord came unto me in the morning, saying,
026	EZE	012	009	Son of man, have not the house of Israel, the rebellious family, said unto thee, What doest thou?
026	EZE	012	010	Say thou unto them, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, For the prince in Jerusalem is the doom, and for all the house of Israel, [and those] that are in the midst of them.
026	EZE	012	011	Say, I am your token; just as I have done, so shall it be done unto them: into exile, into captivity, shall they wander.
026	EZE	012	012	And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the dark, and shall go forth; through the wall shall they break a hole to carry [things] through it: his face shall he cover up, that he may not see the ground with his eyes.
026	EZE	012	013	And I will spread out my net over him, and he shall be caught in my snare: and I will bring him to Babylon into the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, and there shall he die.
026	EZE	012	014	And all that are round about him, those who assist him, and all the wings of his armies will I disperse toward every wind; and the sword will I draw out after them.
026	EZE	012	015	And they shall know that I am the Lord, when I scatter them among the nations, and disperse them in the countries.
026	EZE	012	016	But I will leave of them men few in number from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence: in order that they may relate all their abominations among the nations whither they shall have come; and they shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	012	017	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	012	018	Son of man, thy bread shalt thou eat with quaking, and thy water shalt thou drink with trembling and with anxious care.
026	EZE	012	019	And thou shalt say unto the people of the land, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem, [and] concerning the land of Israel, Their bread shall they eat with anxious care, and their water shall they drink with confusion, for the cause that her land will be desolate, deprived of its plenteousness because of the violence of all those that dwell therein.
026	EZE	012	020	And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid in ruins, and the land shall be made desolate: and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	012	021	And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	012	022	Son of man, what sort of proverb is that which ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are lasting long, and lost is every vision?
026	EZE	012	023	Therefore say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, I will cause this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but speak unto them, The days are coming nigh, and the word of every vision.
026	EZE	012	024	For there shall be no more any false vision and a deceptive divination within the house of Israel.
026	EZE	012	025	For I am the Lord, —I do speak, and whatever word I do speak shall be done; it shall not be delayed any more; for in your days, O rebellious family, will I speak the word, and I will execute it, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	012	026	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	012	027	Son of man, behold, the house of Israel say, The vision that he foreseeth is for distant days, and for times that are far off doth he prophesy.
026	EZE	012	028	Therefore say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, There shall not be delayed any more one of all my words; but whatever word I do speak shall be done, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	013	001	And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	013	002	Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou unto those that prophesy out of their own heart, Hear ye the word of the Lord:
026	EZE	013	003	Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Woe unto the scandalous prophets, that follow their own spirit, without having seen any thing!
026	EZE	013	004	Like foxes among the ruins have been thy prophets, O Israel!
026	EZE	013	005	Ye did not go up into the breaches, nor did ye make a fence around the house of Israel to stand in the battle on the day of the Lord.
026	EZE	013	006	They saw falsehood and lying divination, they who say, “The Lord saith,” when the Lord had not sent them; and yet they made others hope for the fulfillment of the word.
026	EZE	013	007	Had ye not seen a false vision, and had ye not said a lying divination? and ye say, “The Lord saith,” when I have not spoken.
026	EZE	013	008	Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Whereas ye have spoken falsehood, and have seen lies: therefore, behold, I am against you, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	013	009	And my hand shall be against the prophets that see false-hood, and that divine lies; in the secret council of my people shall they not be, and in the register of the house of Israel shall they not be written, and into the land of Israel shall they not come: and ye shall know that I am the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	013	010	Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, “Peace,” when there was no peace: and [my people] build a protecting wall, and lo, they plaster it with unadhesive mortar.
026	EZE	013	011	Say unto those who plaster it with unadhesive mortar, that it shall fall: there cometh an overflowing rain-shower; and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a storm-wind shall rend it.
026	EZE	013	012	And, lo, the wall is fallen down; will it not now be said unto you, Where is the plastering wherewith ye have plastered?
026	EZE	013	013	Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, I will even rend it with storm-winds in my fury; and an overflowing rain-shower shall come in my anger, with great hailstones in my fury to destroy it.
026	EZE	013	014	And I will pull down the wall that ye have plastered with unadhesive mortar, and I will cast it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be laid open; and it shall fall, and ye shall be destroyed in the midst of it: and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	013	015	Thus will I let out all my wrath upon the wall, and upon those that have plastered it with unadhesive mortar; and I will say unto you, Gone is the wall, and gone are they that plastered it;
026	EZE	013	016	[Namely,] the prophets of Israel who prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and who see for her a vision of peace, when there is no peace, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	013	017	But, thou son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, who prophesy out of their own heart: and prophesy against them,
026	EZE	013	018	And say, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Woe to the women that sew bolsters together for the armpits of all, and make cushions for the head of every stature, to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my people, that ye may keep your own soul alive?
026	EZE	013	019	And ye profane me among my people for handfuls of barley and for bits of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to keep alive the souls that should not live, by your lying to my people that listen to lies!
026	EZE	013	020	Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I am against your bolsters, whereon ye hunt the souls that they may flutter [in your net], and I will tear them away from your arms; and I will let the souls go free, even the souls that ye hunt that they may flutter [in your net.]
026	EZE	013	021	And I will tear away your cushions, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted: and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	013	022	Because ye grieve the heart of the righteous with falsehood, when I have not given him pain; and strengthen the hands of the wicked, so that he should not return from his wicked way, through which he might live.
026	EZE	013	023	Therefore shall ye see no more falsehood, and tell no more divinations; and I will deliver my people out of your hand: and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	014	001	Then came there unto me certain men of the elders of Israel, and sat down before me.
026	EZE	014	002	And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	014	003	Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and the stumbling-block of their iniquity have they placed before their faces: shall I in any wise let myself be inquired of by them?
026	EZE	014	004	Therefore speak with them and say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Whatever man it be of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart, and layeth the stumbling-block of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet: I the Lord will answer him, although he cometh with the multitude of his idols;
026	EZE	014	005	In order that I may grasp the house of Israel by their heart, those who are separated from me through all their idols.
026	EZE	014	006	Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Return, and cause [your heart] to turn away from your idols: and from all your abominations turn away your faces.
026	EZE	014	007	For whatever man it be of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that sojourneth in Israel, that separateth himself from me, and setteth up his idols in his heart, and layeth the stumbling-block of his iniquity before his face, and then cometh to the prophet to inquire through him of me: I the Lord will answer him through my word;
026	EZE	014	008	And I will set my face against that man, and will make him an astonishment for a sign and for proverbs, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	014	009	And when the prophet suffereth himself to be deceived, and he speaketh a word: I the Lord have suffered that prophet to be deceived: and I will stretch out my hand against him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.
026	EZE	014	010	And they shall bear their guilt: as the guilt of the inquirer is, so shall the guilt of the prophet be;
026	EZE	014	011	In order that the house of Israel may go no more astray by not following me, and not pollute themselves any more with all their transgressions; but that they may become unto me a people, and I may be unto them a God, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	014	012	And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	014	013	Son of man, if a land should sin against me by trespassing grievously, and I stretch out my hand against it, and break unto it the staff of bread, and send out famine against it, and cut off from it man and beast;
026	EZE	014	014	And if there be these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, in the midst of it: these through their righteousness should save but their own soul; saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	014	015	If I cause wild beasts to pass through the land, and they depopulate it, and it becometh desolate, without any one to pass through because of the beasts:
026	EZE	014	016	These three men [if they were] in it, as I live, saith the Lord Eternal, should not save either sons or daughters: they only should be saved, but the land should be made desolate.
026	EZE	014	017	Or, if I should bring a sword over that land, and say, The sword shall pass through the land, and I cut off from it man and beast;
026	EZE	014	018	And if these three men should be in it: as I live, saith the Lord Eternal, they should not save either sons or daughters, but they alone should be saved.
026	EZE	014	019	Or, if I should send out the pestilence against that land, and pour out my fury over it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast;
026	EZE	014	020	And if Noah, Daniel, and Job, should be in the midst of it: as I live, saith the Lord Eternal, they should not save either son or daughter; they through their righteousness should save their own soul.
026	EZE	014	021	For thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Although I send my four dreadful means of punishment over Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the wild beasts, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast:
026	EZE	014	022	Still, behold, there are left therein some that escape who shall be carried forth, both sons and daughters; behold, they are coming forth unto you, and ye will see their way and their doings; and then will ye be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, yea, concerning all that I have brought upon it;
026	EZE	014	023	And they will comfort you, when ye see their way and their doings; and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have executed in it, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	015	001	And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	015	002	Son of man, What shall become of the wood of the vine more than of any other wood, of the branch which was standing among the trees of the forest?
026	EZE	015	003	Can wood be taken therefrom to employ it for any work? or will men take from it a pin to hang thereon any vessel?
026	EZE	015	004	Behold, if it be given up to the fire to be consumed, —[and] the fire have consumed both its ends, and the middle of it be scorched; will it be fit for any work?
026	EZE	015	005	Behold, when it was yet entire, it could not be employed for any work: how much more [must this be] when the fire hath consumed it, and it is scorched, —and shall it yet be employed for any work?
026	EZE	015	006	Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, As the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given up to the fire to be consumed: so do I give up the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
026	EZE	015	007	And I will set my face against them: from the fire have they gone forth, yet the fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I set my face against them.
026	EZE	015	008	And I will render the land a desert; because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	016	001	And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	016	002	Son of man, make known unto Jerusalem her abominations,
026	EZE	016	003	And thou shalt say, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal unto Jerusalem, Thy origin and thy birth are out of the land of Canaan: thy father was an Emorite, and thy mother a Hittite.
026	EZE	016	004	And as for thy birth, on the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut, nor wast thou washed in water to he cleansed; and thou wast not rubbed with salt, nor wrapt in swaddling clothes.
026	EZE	016	005	No eye looked with pity on thee, to do any of these things unto thee, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out on the open field, with a loathing of thy body, on the day that thou wast born.
026	EZE	016	006	But I passed then by thee, and I saw thee stained with thy own blood, and I said unto thee, In thy blood, live; yea, I said unto thee, In thy blood, live.
026	EZE	016	007	Myriads, like the vegetation of the field, did I make of thee, and thou didst increase and become great, and thou attainedst the highest attractions: with thy breasts developed, and thy hair full grown; but thou wast still naked and bare.
026	EZE	016	008	But I passed then by thee, and saw thee, and, behold, thy time was the time of love; and I spread the skirt of my garment over thee, and covered thy nakedness: yea, I swore unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord Eternal, and thou becamest mine.
026	EZE	016	009	Then did I bathe thee with water, yea, I thoroughly washed away thy blood from thee; and I anointed thee with oil.
026	EZE	016	010	I clothed thee also with broidered work, and made thee shoes of badger's skin, and I placed on thy head a turban of fine linen, and I covered thee with silk.
026	EZE	016	011	And I decked thee with ornaments, and I placed bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain around thy neck.
026	EZE	016	012	And I placed a ring on thy nose, and earrings in thy ears, and a crown of splendor on thy head.
026	EZE	016	013	Thus wast thou ornamented with gold and silver; and thy garments were of fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; fine flour, and honey, and oil didst thou eat: and thou wast exceedingly beautiful, and thou didst succeed to acquire dominion.
026	EZE	016	014	And thy fame went forth among the nations because of thy beauty; for it was perfect through my glorious ornament, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	016	015	But thou didst trust in thy beauty, and play the harlot because of thy fame, and lavish thy lewd caresses on every one that passed by—on him they were bestowed.
026	EZE	016	016	And thou didst take from thy garments, and deck thee high-places with divers colors, and play the harlot thereupon: never should the like come to pass, and never should it be so.
026	EZE	016	017	And thou didst take thy elegant ornaments of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and make for thyself male images, and play the harlot with them;
026	EZE	016	018	And thou didst take thy broidered garments, and cover them: and my oil and my incense didst thou place before them.
026	EZE	016	019	And my bread which I had given thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, which I had let thee eat, even this didst thou set before them for a sweet savour: yes, so was it, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	016	020	And thou didst take thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hadst born unto me, and didst slaughter these unto them to be devoured; [but] were thy acts of lewdness not yet enough?
026	EZE	016	021	That thou didst slay my children, and give them up to cause them to pass through the fire for them?
026	EZE	016	022	And in all thy abominations and thy acts of lewdness thou didst not remember the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, when thou wast stained with thy blood.
026	EZE	016	023	And it came to pass after all thy wickedness, —[woe, woe unto thee! saith the Lord Eternal;]—
026	EZE	016	024	That thou didst build unto thyself eminences, and make thyself elevations in every street.
026	EZE	016	025	On the corner of every road didst thou build thy elevations, and make thy beauty abominable, and spread out thy feet to every one that passed by, and multiply thy acts of lewdness.
026	EZE	016	026	And thou didst play the harlot with the Egyptians, thy neighbors, with large limbs, and multiply thy acts of lewdness, to provoke me to anger.
026	EZE	016	027	And, behold, I stretched out my hand over thee, and diminished thy stated portion; and I gave thee up unto the will of those that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, who were made to blush for thy incestuous course.
026	EZE	016	028	Then didst thou play the harlot with the sons of Asshur, because thou wast unsatiable: yea, thou didst play the harlot with them, and wast even then not satisfied.
026	EZE	016	029	And thou didst multiply thy lewdness with the traders' land as far as Chaldea; and even with this wast thou not satisfied.
026	EZE	016	030	How very corrupt is thy heart, saith the Lord Eternal, seeing thou didst all these things, deeds of an abandoned lewd woman;
026	EZE	016	031	Seeing that thou didst build thy eminences at the corner of every road, and make thy elevations in every street; and wast not like a harlot, as thou scornedst the wages.
026	EZE	016	032	O thou adulterous wife! who, while bound to her husband, receiveth strangers!
026	EZE	016	033	Unto all harlots they give presents; but thou hast given thy presents to all thy lovers, and hast bribed them, that they might come unto thee from every side in thy acts of lewdness.
026	EZE	016	034	And the reverse was the case with thee from [other] women in thy acts of lewdness, that men did not follow thee to seek thy lewd caresses; and because thou gavest the wages, and no wages were given thee: so was it the reverse with thee.
026	EZE	016	035	Therefore, O harlot, hear the word of the Lord!
026	EZE	016	036	Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Whereas thy wealth was squandered, and thy nakedness was uncovered through thy lewd acts with thy lovers, and with all thy abominable idols, and for the blood of thy children, whom thou didst give unto them:
026	EZE	016	037	Therefore, behold, I will gather all thy lovers, whom thou hast given pleasure, and all whom thou hast loved, together with all whom thou hast hated, —yea, I will gather them all round about thee, and will uncover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness.
026	EZE	016	038	And I will judge thee, as adulteresses and women that shed blood are judged; and I will bring upon thee the blood of fury and jealousy.
026	EZE	016	039	And I will also give thee up into their hand, and they shall pull down thy eminences, and shall break down thy elevations; and they shall strip thee of thy clothes, and they shall take thy elegant ornaments, and leave thee naked and bare.
026	EZE	016	040	And they shall bring up against thee an assembly, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords;
026	EZE	016	041	And they shall burn thy houses with fire, and execute punishments on thee before the eyes of many women: and I will cause thee to cease from being a harlot, and also the wages [of sin] shalt thou not give any more.
026	EZE	016	042	And then will I assuage my fury on thee, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.
026	EZE	016	043	Because that thou didst not remember the days of thy youth, but didst irritate me with all these things: behold, therefore I also will bring thy course upon thy head, saith the Lord Eternal, and thou shalt no more commit incest with all thy [other] abominations.
026	EZE	016	044	Behold, every one that speaketh in proverbs shall use this proverb against thee, saying, As the mother is, so is her daughter.
026	EZE	016	045	Thou art thy mother's daughter, loathing her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, who have loathed their husbands and their children: your mother was a Hittite, and your father an Emorite.
026	EZE	016	046	And thy elder sister is Samaria, she with her daughters, that dwelleth at thy left hand, and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom with her daughters.
026	EZE	016	047	Yet not even in their ways didst thou walk, nor act according to their abominations: as though this were quite too little, and thou wast more corrupt than they in all thy ways.
026	EZE	016	048	As I live, saith the Lord Eternal, Sodom thy sister, she with her daughters, hath not done as thou hast done, thou with thy daughters.
026	EZE	016	049	Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom: Pride, abundance of food, and prosperous security were hers and her daughters'; but the hand of the poor and needy did she not strengthen.
026	EZE	016	050	And they became haughty, and committed abominations before me: therefore did I remove them when I saw their course.
026	EZE	016	051	And Samaria hath not committed even the half of thy sins; but thou didst multiply thy abominations more than they; and thou hast justified thy sisters through all thy abominations which thou hast done.
026	EZE	016	052	Bear then thou also thy own confusion, which thou didst adjudge unto each of thy sisters; through thy sins, which thou hast committed more abominably than they, are they made more righteous than thou: therefore thou also—be ashamed, and bear thy confusion, since thou hast justified thy sisters.
026	EZE	016	053	And I will bring back again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, and the captivity of the captives in the midst of them:
026	EZE	016	054	In order that thou mayest bear thy confusion, and mayest be confounded because of all that thou hast done, when thou art a comfort unto them.
026	EZE	016	055	And thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former state, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former state, and thou and thy daughters shall return to your former state.
026	EZE	016	056	And was not thy sister Sodom a report in thy mouth in the days of thy pride,
026	EZE	016	057	Before yet thy wickedness was discovered, as at the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all those round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, who taunted thee on all sides?
026	EZE	016	058	Thy incest and thy abominations, —thou thyself hadst to bear them, saith the Lord.
026	EZE	016	059	For thus hath said the Lord Eternal, I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, thou who hast despised the oath by breaking the covenant.
026	EZE	016	060	Nevertheless will I indeed remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.
026	EZE	016	061	And thou shalt then remember thy ways, and be confounded, when thou receivest thy sisters, both those that are older than thou and younger than thou: and I will give them unto thee for daughters, though not because thou wast faithful to the covenant.
026	EZE	016	062	And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord:
026	EZE	016	063	In order that thou mayest remember, and feel ashamed, and never open thy mouth any more because of thy confusion, when I forgive thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	017	001	And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	017	002	Son of man, put forth a riddle, and propound a parable unto the house of Israel;
026	EZE	017	003	And say, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, The great eagle with large wings, long winged, full of feathers, who is rich in many colors, came unto the Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar:
026	EZE	017	004	The topmost of its young twigs did he crop off, and carry it into the traders' land; and he set it in a city of merchants.
026	EZE	017	005	And he took some of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful field: he placed it by great waters, he transplanted it among the willow-trees.
026	EZE	017	006	And it grew, and became a trailing vine of low stature, the tendrils of which should turn toward him, and the roots of which should be under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and sent out shoots.
026	EZE	017	007	There was also another great eagle with large wings and many feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend its roots famishing toward him, and shot forth its tendrils toward him, that he might water it, from the beds where it was planted;
026	EZE	017	008	[Although] it was planted in a good field by great waters, that it might produce boughs, and that it might bear fruit, that it might become an elegant vine.
026	EZE	017	009	Say now, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Shall it prosper? Behold the other will pull up its roots, and its fruit will he cut away, that it may dry up; every one of its growing leaves shall dry up; and not with great power and numerous people [will he have to come] to tear it away from its roots.
026	EZE	017	010	Yea, behold, although it is planted, shall it prosper? Lo, as soon as the east wind toucheth it, shall it be utterly dried up: in the beds where it groweth shall it dry up.
026	EZE	017	011	And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	017	012	Do now say to the rebellious family, Know ye not what these things mean? Say, Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and took away its king and its princes, and he brought them unto himself to Babylon;
026	EZE	017	013	And he took one of the royal seed, and made a covenant with him, and bound him with an oath; but the mighty of the land did he take away;
026	EZE	017	014	That the kingdom should be debased, so as not to lift itself up; that it should keep his covenant that it might continue to exist.
026	EZE	017	015	But he rebelled against him by sending his messengers into Egypt, that they might give him horses and numerous people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doth such things? yea, he hath broken the covenant, and shall he escape?
026	EZE	017	016	As I live, saith the Lord Eternal, surely in the residence of the king that hath made him king, whose oath he hath despised, and whose covenant he hath broken, even near him in the midst of Babylon shall he die.
026	EZE	017	017	And not with a mighty army and a large assembly shall Pharaoh labor for him in the war, when [the other] casteth up mounds, and buildeth works of attack, to cut off many souls.
026	EZE	017	018	Yea, he that hath despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, lo, he had given his hand, and hath done all these things, shall not escape.
026	EZE	017	019	Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, As I live, surely my oath that he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken, —even this will I bring upon his own head.
026	EZE	017	020	And I will spread my net over him, and he shall be caught in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will hold judgment with him there for his trespass which he hath committed against me.
026	EZE	017	021	And all his fugitives with all the wings of his army shall fall by the sword, and those that remain shall be dispersed toward all winds: and ye shall know that I the Lord have spoken it.
026	EZE	017	022	Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, But I myself will take [a part] of the highest branch of the high cedar, and will preserve it; from the topmost of its young twigs will I crop off a tender one, and I myself will plant it firmly upon a high and eminent mountain:
026	EZE	017	023	On the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it firmly; and it shall produce boughs, and bear fruit, and become an elegant cedar; and there shall dwell under it all fowls, every thing that hath wing; in the shadow of its light branches shall they dwell.
026	EZE	017	024	And all the trees of the field shall know that I the Lord have made low the high tree, have made high the lowly tree, that I have dried up the green tree, and have caused to flourish the dry tree: I the Lord have spoken and have done it.
026	EZE	018	001	And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	018	002	What mean ye, that ye use this proverb in the country of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the teeth of the children are set on edge?
026	EZE	018	003	As I live, saith the Lord Eternal, ye shall not have any more to use this proverb in Israel.
026	EZE	018	004	Behold, all the souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son—mine are they: the soul which sinneth that alone shall die.
026	EZE	018	005	But if a man be righteous, and execute justice and righteousness;
026	EZE	018	006	Upon the mountains he eateth not, and his eyes he lifteth not up to the idols of the house of Israel, and the wife of his neighbor he defileth not, and unto a woman in her separation he cometh not near;
026	EZE	018	007	And he over-reacheth no man, he restoreth his pledge for a debt, a robbery he doth not commit, his bread he giveth to the hungry, and the naked he covereth with a garment;
026	EZE	018	008	Upon interest he giveth not forth, and increase he doth not take, from wrong he withdraweth his hand, true judgment he executeth between man and man;
026	EZE	018	009	In my statutes he walketh steadfastly, and my ordinances he keepeth to deal truly: he is righteous, he shall surely live, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	018	010	If he [now] beget a dissolute son that sheddeth blood and doth to [his] brother any one of thee things;
026	EZE	018	011	And he is one that doth not any of these [duties]; but eateth even upon the mountains, and defileth the wife of his neighbor;
026	EZE	018	012	The poor and needy he over-reacheth, he is guilty of robberies, the pledge he restoreth not, and to the idols he lifteth up his eyes, abominations he committeth:
026	EZE	018	013	Upon interest he giveth forth, and increase he taketh: and he should live? he shall not live; all these abominations hath he done, he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.
026	EZE	018	014	And behold, if he beget a son, who seeth all the sins of his father which he hath done, and he considereth, and doth not the like of them;
026	EZE	018	015	Upon the mountains he eateth not, and his eyes he lifteth not up to the idols of the house of Israel, the wife of his neighbor he defileth not;
026	EZE	018	016	And he over-reacheth no man, a pledge he withholdeth not, and of a robbery he is never guilty, his bread he giveth to the hungry, and the naked he covereth with a garment;
026	EZE	018	017	From the poor he withdraweth his hand, interest and increase he taketh not: my ordinances he executeth; in my statutes he walketh: —he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live.
026	EZE	018	018	His father, because he unjustly withheld [wages], was guilty of robbery on his brother, and did that which is not good in the midst of his people, —and lo, he died through his iniquity.
026	EZE	018	019	Yet say ye, Why doth not the son bear part of the iniquity of the father? when the son hath executed justice and righteousness, all my statutes hath he kept, and hath done them: he shall surely live.
026	EZE	018	020	The soul that sinneth, she alone shall die; the son shall not help to bear the iniquity of the father and the father shall not help to bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.
026	EZE	018	021	And the wicked, when he turneth away from all his sins that he hath committed, and keepeth all my statutes, and executeth justice and righteousness, shall surely live, he shall not die.
026	EZE	018	022	All his transgressions which he hath committed shall not be remembered unto him: through his righteousness which he hath done shall he live.
026	EZE	018	023	Have I then the least pleasure in the death of the wicked? saith the Lord Eternal: and not in his turning away from his ways, that he may live?
026	EZE	018	024	But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth wrong, and doth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live? all his righteousness that he hath done shall not he remembered: through his trespass which he hath committed, and through his sin that he hath done, —through them shall he die.
026	EZE	018	025	Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equitable: hear now, O house of Israel, Is not my way equitable? is it not your ways which are not equitable?
026	EZE	018	026	When a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness, and doth wrong, and dieth therefore: through his wrong which he hath done must he die.
026	EZE	018	027	Again, when the wicked turneth away from his wickedness which he hath committed, and executeth justice and righteousness: he shall indeed preserve his soul alive.
026	EZE	018	028	Because he hath considered, and turned away from all his transgressions which he had committed: he shall surely live, he shall not die.
026	EZE	018	029	Yet say the house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not equitable: are not my ways equitable, O house of Israel? is it not your ways which are not equitable?
026	EZE	018	030	Therefore will I judge you, every one according to his ways, O house of Israel, saith the Lord Eternal: return ye, and cause others to return from all your transgressions, that iniquity may not become your stumbling-block.
026	EZE	018	031	Cast away from yourselves all your transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed; and make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?
026	EZE	018	032	For I have no pleasure in the death of him that deserveth to die, saith the Lord Eternal: therefore convert yourselves, and live.
026	EZE	019	001	And thou, —do thou lift up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,
026	EZE	019	002	And say, What a noble lioness was thy mother! among lions did she lie down, in the midst of young lions did she raise her whelps!
026	EZE	019	003	And she brought up one of her whelps: he became a young lion, and he learned to tear in pieces the prey; [even] men he devoured.
026	EZE	019	004	And when nations heard of him, he was caught in their pit, and they brought him with nose-rings unto the land of Egypt.
026	EZE	019	005	Now when she saw that she had long waited, [that] her hope was lost, she took another one of her whelps, and made him a young lion.
026	EZE	019	006	And he went up and down in the midst of lions, he became a young lion; and he learned to tear in pieces the prey; even men he devoured.
026	EZE	019	007	And he broke down their palaces, and their cities laid he in ruins: and then was terrified the land, with all that filled it, because of the noise of his roaring.
026	EZE	019	008	Then set themselves the nations against him on every side from the provinces; and they spread over him their net: in their pit was he caught.
026	EZE	019	009	And they put him in a cage with nose-rings [in his nose], and they brought him to the king of Babylon: they brought him into strong-holds, in order that his voice should no more be heard on the mountains of Israel.
026	EZE	019	010	Thy mother was like a vine, if I compare thee to aught, planted by the waters: fruitful and full of boughs was she by reason of many waters.
026	EZE	019	011	And she had strong branches [fit] for the sceptres of rulers, and her stature grew up high between the thick-branched [trees], and she was seen through her height by means of the multitude of her tendrils.
026	EZE	019	012	But she was plucked up in fury, to the ground was she cast down, and the east wind dried up her fruit: and torn off and dried up were her strong branches, a fire consumed them.
026	EZE	019	013	And now is she planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land.
026	EZE	019	014	And fire is gone out of a branch of her boughs, and hath devoured her fruit, so that there is no more on her a strong branch for a sceptre to rule. This is a lamentation, and it is become a lamentation.
026	EZE	020	001	And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, that certain men of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the Lord, and they sat down before me.
026	EZE	020	002	And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	020	003	Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Is it to inquire of me that ye are coming? as I live, I will not let myself be inquired of by you, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	020	004	Wilt thou take them to task, wilt thou take them to task, son of man? then cause them to know the abominations of their fathers;
026	EZE	020	005	And say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, On the day when I made choice of Israel, I lifted up my hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob, and I made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt: and I lifted up my hand unto them, saying, I am the Lord your God.
026	EZE	020	006	On the same day I lifted up my hand unto them, to bring them forth from the land of Egypt into a land that I had selected for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is an ornament among all the countries.
026	EZE	020	007	And I said unto them, Cast ye away every one of the abominations of his eyes, and on the idols of Egypt shall ye not defile yourselves: I am the Lord your God.
026	EZE	020	008	But they rebelled against me, and they would not hearken unto me; they did not cast away every one the abominations of their eyes, and the idols of Egypt did they not forsake: and I thought then to pour out my fury over them, to let out all my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
026	EZE	020	009	But I acted for the sake of my name, so as not to profane it before the eyes of the nations, in the midst of whom they were; because I had made myself known unto them before their eyes, to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt.
026	EZE	020	010	I therefore caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness.
026	EZE	020	011	And I gave them my statutes, and my ordinances made I known to them, which a man is to do, that he may live through them.
026	EZE	020	012	And also my sabbaths gave I unto them, to be as a sign between me and between them, that they might know that I am the Lord who sanctify them.
026	EZE	020	013	But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness; in my statutes they walked not, and my ordinances they despised, which a man is to do, that he may live through them; and my sabbaths they greatly profaned: and I then thought to pour out my fury over them in the wilderness, to make an end of them.
026	EZE	020	014	But I acted for the sake of my name, so as not to profane it before the eyes of the nations, before whose eyes I had brought them forth.
026	EZE	020	015	Yet did I also lift up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given [them], flowing with milk and honey, which is an ornament among all the countries.
026	EZE	020	016	Because my ordinances they had despised, and in my statutes they had not walked, and my sabbaths they had profaned; for after their idols did their heart go.
026	EZE	020	017	Nevertheless my eye looked pityingly on them, so as not to destroy them, and I did not make an end of them in the wilderness.
026	EZE	020	018	And I said unto their children in the wilderness, In the statutes of your fathers shall ye not walk, and their ordinances shall ye not keep, and on their idols shall ye not defile yourselves.
026	EZE	020	019	I am the Lord your God: in my statutes must ye walk, and my ordinances must ye keep, and do them;
026	EZE	020	020	And my sabbaths must ye sanctify; and they shall be as a sign between me and between you, that ye may know that I am the Lord your God.
026	EZE	020	021	Nevertheless the children rebelled against me; in my statutes did they not walk, and my ordinances they kept not to do them, which a man is to do, that he may live through them; my sabbaths they profaned: and I then thought to pour out my fury over them, to let out all my anger against them in the wilderness.
026	EZE	020	022	But I withdrew my hand, and acted for the sake of my name, so as not to profane it before the eyes of the nations, before whose eyes I had brought them forth.
026	EZE	020	023	I also lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the nations, and disperse them through the countries;
026	EZE	020	024	Because my ordinances they had not executed, and my statutes they had despised, and my sabbaths they had profaned, and after the idols of their fathers their eyes were directed.
026	EZE	020	025	And I also let them follow statutes that were not good, and ordinances whereby they could not live;
026	EZE	020	026	And I let them be defiled through their gifts, in that they caused to pass [through the fire] all that openeth the womb, in order that I might destroy them, to the end that they might know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	020	027	Therefore, speak unto the house of Israel, O son of man, and say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Yet in this too did your fathers blaspheme me, by their committing a trespass against me:
026	EZE	020	028	When I had brought them into the land, for which I had lifted up my hand to give it to them, they saw every high hill, and all the thick-branched trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and presented there their provoking offerings, and they brought there their sweet savor, and poured out there their drink-offerings.
026	EZE	020	029	Then said I unto them, What is this high-place whereunto ye go? And its name was called “The height” until this day.
026	EZE	020	030	Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Ha! do you pollute yourselves after the manner of your fathers; and after their abominations do ye go astray?
026	EZE	020	031	And when ye offer up your gifts, when ye make your sons pass through the fire, ye pollute yourselves with all your idols, even until this day: and I should allow myself to be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord Eternal, I will not let myself be inquired of by you.
026	EZE	020	032	And that which cometh up into your mind shall not at all come to pass, [namely,] that ye say, We will be like the nations, like the families of the [other] countries, to serve wood and stone.
026	EZE	020	033	As I live, saith the Lord Eternal, surely, with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule over you:
026	EZE	020	034	And I will bring you out from the people, and I will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with [my] fury poured out.
026	EZE	020	035	And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and I will hold judgment over you there, face to face.
026	EZE	020	036	As I held judgment over your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I hold judgment over you, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	020	037	And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant;
026	EZE	020	038	And I will separate from you those that have rebelled, and those that have transgressed against me: out of the country where they sojourn will I cause them to go forth, but into the land of Israel shall not one [of them] enter; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	020	039	As for you, O house of Israel, thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Go ye, serve ye every one his idols, and hereafter [also], if ye will not hearken unto me; but my holy name do not profane any more with your gifts, and with your idols.
026	EZE	020	040	For on my holy mountain, on the mountain of the height of Israel, saith the Lord Eternal, there shall serve me all the house of Israel, altogether, in the land: there will I accept them in favor, and there will I require your heave-offerings, and the first-fruits of your oblations, with all your holy things.
026	EZE	020	041	With your sweet savor will I accept you in favor, when I bring you out from the people, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered: and I will be sanctified through you before the eyes of the nations.
026	EZE	020	042	And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I bring you into the land of Israel, into the country for which I have lifted up my hand to give it to your fathers.
026	EZE	020	043	And ye shall remember there your ways, and all your doings, whereby ye have been defiled; and ye shall loathe yourselves, because of all your evil deeds that ye have committed.
026	EZE	020	044	And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I deal with you for the sake of my name, not in accordance with your wicked ways, and in accordance with your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	020	045	And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	020	046	Son of man, set thy face in the direction toward the south, and preach toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the field in the south.
026	EZE	020	047	And say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the Lord, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour in thee every green tree, and every dry tree: the glowing flame shall not be quenched, and there shall be burnt therein all faces from the south to the north.
026	EZE	020	048	And all flesh shall see that I the Lord have kindled it: it shall not be quenched.
026	EZE	020	049	Then said I, Ah Lord Eternal! they say of me, Behold, he speaketh but in parables!
026	EZE	021	001	And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	021	002	Son of man, direct thy face toward Jerusalem, and preach toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel,
026	EZE	021	003	And say to the land of Israel, Thus hath said the Lord, Behold, I will be against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of its sheath; and I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked.
026	EZE	021	004	But because I shall have cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked: therefore shall my sword go forth out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north;
026	EZE	021	005	That all flesh may know that I the Lord have drawn forth my sword out of its sheath; it shall not return any more.
026	EZE	021	006	But thou, son of man, do thou sigh: as though with broken loins, and with bitterness [of grief] shalt thou sigh before their eyes.
026	EZE	021	007	And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt say, For the report, because it cometh, when every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be made feeble, and every spirit shall become faint, and all knees shall be changed into water: behold, it cometh, and shall be brought to pass, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	021	008	And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	021	009	Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus hath said the Lord, Say, The sword, the sword is sharpened, and also polished;
026	EZE	021	010	In order to make a thorough slaughter is it sharpened; in order that it may glitter is it polished: how can we now rejoice, [when] the rod which reacheth my son excelleth in hardness every tree?
026	EZE	021	011	And he hath given it to be polished, to make it fit to grasp it in the hand: it is the sword which is sharpened, and it is polished, to place it into the hand of the slayer.
026	EZE	021	012	Cry aloud and wail, O son of man; for it cometh against my people, it cometh against all the princes of Israel; brought together for the sword are they with my people: therefore strike [thy hand] upon thy thigh.
026	EZE	021	013	For a purification taketh place: and what if the irresistible rod will also come? [my son] would not be able to exist, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	021	014	But thou, son of man, prophesy, and strike thy hands together, and let “The sword” be repeated the third time, the sword of the slain: it is the sword of the great that are slain, which lieth in wait for them everywhere.
026	EZE	021	015	In order to make timid the heart, and to multiply the stumbling-blocks, do I bring the howling of the sword against all their gates: ah! it is made bright, it is made thin-edged for the slaughter.
026	EZE	021	016	Gather up thy strength, go to the right hand, direct thyself, go to the left, whithersoever thy edge is turned.
026	EZE	021	017	And I also, —I will strike my hands together, and I will cause my fury to be assuaged: I the Lord have spoken it.
026	EZE	021	018	And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	021	019	But thou, O son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come; out of one land shall both of them come forth: and select a place; at the head of the way to a city do thou select it.
026	EZE	021	020	A way shalt thou appoint, that the sword may come against Rabbah of the children of 'Ammon, and [the other] against Judah [dwelling] in Jerusalem the fortified.
026	EZE	021	021	For the king of Babylon hath halted at the parting of the way, at the commencement of the two ways, to use divination: he shaketh the arrows, he consulteth with images, he looketh at the liver.
026	EZE	021	022	At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to erect battering-rams, to open the mouth with the [cry for] murder, to lift up the voice with shouting, to place battering-rams against the gates, to cast up a mound, and to build works of attack.
026	EZE	021	023	And it will appear unto them as a false divination in their eyes, to those that had sworn oaths; but he will bring to remembrance their iniquity, that they may be caught.
026	EZE	021	024	Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Because ye have brought your iniquity to remembrance, as your transgressions are discovered, so that your sins do appear in all your doings: because ye are thus brought to remembrance, ye shall be caught by [his] hand.
026	EZE	021	025	And thou, death-deserving wicked one, prince of Israel, whose day is come, at the time of the iniquity of the end, —
026	EZE	021	026	Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Remove the mitre, and take off the crown: this shall not be always so; exalt him that is low, and make him low that is high.
026	EZE	021	027	Overthrown, overthrown, overthrown will I render it: also this shall not belong [to any one], until he come whose right it is, and I will give it him.
026	EZE	021	028	And thou, son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal concerning the children of 'Ammon, and concerning their reproach: even say thou, The sword, the sword is drawn; for the slaughter is it polished, to destroy, that it may continue to glitter;
026	EZE	021	029	While they foresee unto thee falsehood, while they divine unto thee lies, to lay thee by the necks of the slain wicked, whose day is come, at the time of the iniquity of the end.
026	EZE	021	030	Put back [the sword] into its sheath! in the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy origin, will I judge thee.
026	EZE	021	031	And I will pour out over thee my indignation, with the fire of my wrath will I blow against thee, and I will give thee up into the hand of brutish men, skilful in destroying.
026	EZE	021	032	To the fire shalt thou be given to be devoured; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land: thou shalt not be remembered [any more]; for I the Lord have spoken it.
026	EZE	022	001	And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	022	002	And thou, son of man, wilt thou take to task, wilt thou take to task the city of blood? and wilt thou make her know all her abominations?
026	EZE	022	003	Then say thou, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, O city that sheddeth blood in her midst, that her time [of sorrow] may come, and that hath made idols for herself to become unclean:
026	EZE	022	004	Through thy blood which thou hast shed, are thou become guilty; and through thy idols which thou hast made art thou become unclean; and thou hast caused thy days [of destruction] to draw near, and thou art come even unto thy years; therefore do I make thee a disgrace unto the nations, and a mocking to all the countries.
026	EZE	022	005	Those who are near, and those who are far from thee, shall mock thee, O thou unclean in name, and great in confusion!
026	EZE	022	006	Behold, the princes of Israel were each [ready] with his arm within thee, in order to shed blood.
026	EZE	022	007	Father and mother they esteemed lightly within thee, toward the stranger they acted with extortion in the midst of thee, the fatherless and the widow they oppressed within thee.
026	EZE	022	008	My holy things thou didst despise, and my sabbaths thou didst profane.
026	EZE	022	009	Tale-bearers [also] were within thee, in order to shed blood; and upon the mountains did they eat within thee; incest did they commit in the midst of thee.
026	EZE	022	010	Their father's nakedness they uncovered within thee; her that was unclean in her separation did they violate within thee.
026	EZE	022	011	And one with his neighbor's wife did commit abomination; and another did defile his daughter-in-law with incest; and another did violate his sister, the daughter of his father, within thee.
026	EZE	022	012	Bribes they took within thee, in order to shed blood; interest and increase didst thou take, and thou didst acquire gain off thy neighbors by extortion: and me thou didst forget, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	022	013	And behold, I have struck my hands together at thy wrongful gain which thou hast acquired, and at thy blood-guilt which hath been in the midst of thee.
026	EZE	022	014	Will thy courage endure, or will thy hands remain strong, on the days that I will deal with thee? I the Lord have spoken, and will do it.
026	EZE	022	015	And I will scatter thee among the nations, and disperse thee in the countries, and I will entirely remove thy uncleanness out of thee.
026	EZE	022	016	And thou shalt be degraded through thyself before the eyes of nations, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	022	017	And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	022	018	Son of man, the house of Israel are become to me dross: they all are copper, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; the dross of silver are they become.
026	EZE	022	019	Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Because ye are all become dross, therefore, behold, I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.
026	EZE	022	020	As silver, and copper, and iron, and lead, and tin are gathered into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it: so will I gather you in my anger and in my fury and I will lay you down there, and melt you.
026	EZE	022	021	Yea, I will assemble you in a heap, and blow upon you with the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst of it.
026	EZE	022	022	As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst of it: and ye shall know that I am the Lord who have poured out my fury over you.
026	EZE	022	023	And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	022	024	Son of man, say unto her, Thou art a land that is not cleansed; [and] which is not rained upon on the day of indignation.
026	EZE	022	025	The banded troop of her prophets in the midst of her is like a roaring lion that teareth in pieces the prey: souls do they devour; wealth and precious things do they take away; the number of her widows do they increase in the midst of her.
026	EZE	022	026	Her priests violate my law, and profane my holy things: between the holy and profane do they make no distinction, and the difference between the unclean and the clean do they not make known, and from [the violation of] my sabbaths do they turn away their eyes, so that I am profaned among them.
026	EZE	022	027	Her princes in her midst are like wolves that tear in pieces the prey, to shed blood, to destroy souls, in order to obtain selfish gain.
026	EZE	022	028	And her prophets plastered for them with unadhesive mortar, foreseeing falsehood, and divining unto them lies, saying, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal; when the Lord had not spoken.
026	EZE	022	029	The people of the land are guilty of extortion, and practise robbery, and the poor and the needy they defraud: and they extort from the stranger with injustice.
026	EZE	022	030	And I seek now among them for a man, that could erect a fence, and stand in the breach before me in behalf of the land, so that I should not destroy it; but I find none.
026	EZE	022	031	And I therefore pour out over them my indignation; with the fire of my wrath do I make an end of them: their own way do I bring upon their head, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	023	001	And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	023	002	Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother;
026	EZE	023	003	And they played the harlot in Egypt; in their youth they played the harlot: there were their breasts pressed, and there they suffered their virgin bosoms to be touched.
026	EZE	023	004	And their names were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister; but they became mine, and they bore sons and daughters: and their names are, Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem, Aholibah.
026	EZE	023	005	And Aholah played the harlot while she was mine; and she longed for her lovers, for the Assyrians that were near [her],
026	EZE	023	006	Clothed [as they were] in blue, governors, and rulers, attractive youths all of them, horsemen riding upon horses.
026	EZE	023	007	Thus she played the harlot with them, all of them the chosen ones of the sons of Asshur: and with all for whom she longed, —with all their idols did she defile herself.
026	EZE	023	008	But also her lewdness from Egypt forsook she not; for they had lain with her in her youth, and they had touched her virgin bosom, and had lavished their lewd caresses on her.
026	EZE	023	009	Therefore did I give her up into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the sons of Asshur, after whom she longed.
026	EZE	023	010	These were they that laid open her nakedness; her sons and her daughters did they take away, and her they slew with the sword: and she became infamous among women, when they inflicted the decreed punishments on her.
026	EZE	023	011	And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she became more corrupt in her longing than she, and in her lewd acts more than her sister's lewdness.
026	EZE	023	012	For the sons of Asshur did she long, the governors and rulers that were near, clothed as they were most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, attractive youths all of them.
026	EZE	023	013	Then saw I that she was defiled, that they followed both one way.
026	EZE	023	014	But she added still more to her acts of lewdness; for when she saw men engraved upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with color,
026	EZE	023	015	Bound with girdles on their loins, with hanging down colored turbans on their heads, in appearance like commanders, all of them, in the likeness of the sons of Babylon of the Chaldeans, the land of their birth:
026	EZE	023	016	Then did she long for them as soon as she saw them with her eyes, and she sent messengers unto them to Chaldea.
026	EZE	023	017	And the sons of Babylon came to her unto the couch of love, and they defiled her with their lewd caresses; and [yet] when she had been defiled with them, she tore her soul away from them.
026	EZE	023	018	And when she had laid open her lewdness, and had uncovered her nakedness: then my soul tore itself away from her, as my soul had torn itself away from her sister.
026	EZE	023	019	Yet she multiplied her deeds of lewdness, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, when she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.
026	EZE	023	020	And she longed for her paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose lustfulness is like the lustfulness of horses.
026	EZE	023	021	And thou calledst to mind the incest of thy youth, when thy bosom was touched by the Egyptians for the sake of thy youthful breasts.
026	EZE	023	022	Therefore, O Aholibah, thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will wake up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy soul hath torn itself away, and I will bring them against thee from every side;
026	EZE	023	023	The sons of Babylon, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa and Koa, and all the sons of Asshur with them, attractive youths, governors and rulers all of them, commanders and chiefs, riding upon horses all of them.
026	EZE	023	024	And they shall come over thee with weapons, chariots, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, buckler and shield and helmet shall they set up against thee round about: and I will give up before them the right to judge, and they shall judge thee according to their ordinances.
026	EZE	023	025	And I will set my zealousness against thee, and they shall deal with thee in fury; thy nose and thy ears shall they cut off; and what is left of thee shall fall by the sword: thy sons and thy daughters shall they take away; and what is left of thee shall be devoured by the fire.
026	EZE	023	026	And they shall strip thee of thy clothes, and take away thy ornamental attire.
026	EZE	023	027	Thus will I make thy incest to cease from thee, and thy lewdness brought from the land of Egypt: and thou shalt not lift up thy eyes unto them, and Egypt shalt thou not remember any more.
026	EZE	023	028	For thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will give thee up into the hand of those whom thou hatest, into the hand of those from whom thy soul hath torn itself away;
026	EZE	023	029	And they shall deal with thee in hate, and shall take away all [things acquired by] thy labor, and they shall leave thee naked and bare: and thus shall be uncovered the nakedness of thy lewdness, and thy incest and thy lewd deeds.
026	EZE	023	030	I will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone with vile lust after the nations, because thou hast defiled thyself with their idols.
026	EZE	023	031	On the way of thy sister hast thou walked; therefore will I place her cup into thy hand.
026	EZE	023	032	Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, The cup of thy sister shalt thou drink, the deep and wide one: thou shalt become to be laughed to scorn and to be held in derision, more than thou canst bear.
026	EZE	023	033	With drunkenness and sorrow shalt thou be filled, [out of] the cup of astonishment and confusion, the cup of thy sister Samaria.
026	EZE	023	034	Thou shalt even drink it and drain it out, and thou shalt break in pieces its fragments, and tear thy own breasts; for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	023	035	Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back: therefore bear thou also thy incest and thy acts of lewdness.
026	EZE	023	036	The Lord said moreover unto me, Son of man, wilt thou call Aholah and Aholibah to account? then tell them of their abominations;
026	EZE	023	037	That they have committed adultery, and there is blood on their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and also their sons whom they had born unto me have they caused to pass for them through [the fire], to devour them.
026	EZE	023	038	Moreover this have they done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary on the same day, and my sabbaths have they profaned.
026	EZE	023	039	And when they had slain their children to their idols, then came they into my sanctuary on the same day to profane it: and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of my house.
026	EZE	023	040	And farthermore yet, because they sent for men who were to come from afar, unto whom messengers were sent; and, lo, they came, for whom thou didst bathe thyself, paint thy eyes, and deck thyself with ornaments;
026	EZE	023	041	And thou didst sit upon a stately bed, with a table spread before it, and my incense and my oil didst thou set upon it.
026	EZE	023	042	And the shout of a peaceful joyous multitude was [heard] within her; and with the men of the masses of the common people were brought Sabeans from the wilderness; and these women placed bracelets on their hands, and crowns of glory upon their heads.
026	EZE	023	043	Then thought I of her that was worn out in adulteries, Will they now [still] commit lewdness with her, when she [is thus]?
026	EZE	023	044	But men went in unto her, as they go in unto a faithless wife: thus went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the incestuous women.
026	EZE	023	045	Righteous men, however—these shall judge them as adulteresses are judged, and as women that shed blood are judged; because adulteresses are they, and blood is on their hands.
026	EZE	023	046	For thus hath said the Lord Eternal, I will bring up against them an assemblage of men, and I will give them up to ill-usage and plunder.
026	EZE	023	047	And the assemblage shall stone them with stones, and cut them down with their swords: their sons and their daughters shall they slay, and their houses shall they burn with fire.
026	EZE	023	048	Thus will I cause incest to cease out of the land, that all women may be warned by example, and not do after your incestuous course.
026	EZE	023	049	And they shall lay your incest upon you, and the sins of your idols shall ye bear: and ye shall know that I am the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	024	001	And the word of the Lord came unto me in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, saying,
026	EZE	024	002	Son of man, write thee down the name of this day, of this same day: the king of Babylon hath advanced against Jerusalem on this same day.
026	EZE	024	003	And speak concerning the rebellious family a parable, and say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Set on the pot, set it on, and also pour water into it;
026	EZE	024	004	Gather the proper pieces into it, every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it up with the choice bones.
026	EZE	024	005	Take the choice of the flock, and make also a fire for the bones under it: cause it to seethe well, that even the bones therein may be fully boiled through.
026	EZE	024	006	Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Woe to the city of blood-guiltiness, to the pot the scum of which is yet in it, and the scum of which is not gone out of it! one of its pieces after the other take out from it: no lot is cast for it.
026	EZE	024	007	For her blood was in the midst of her; on the naked rock did she place it: she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it over with dust.
026	EZE	024	008	To cause my fury to arise to take vengeance, do I place her blood upon the naked rock, so that it shall not be covered up.
026	EZE	024	009	Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Woe to the city of blood-guiltiness! I also will myself build up a large burning pile,
026	EZE	024	010	Heaping on the wood, kindling the fire, thoroughly boiling the flesh, and stirring the mixture, that the bones may be scorched.
026	EZE	024	011	Then will I set it empty upon its coals, in order that it may become hot, and its copper be made to glow, and its uncleanness may be molten in it, that its scum may be consumed.
026	EZE	024	012	With fraud hath she wearied [the poor]; therefore shall not go forth from her the greatness of her scum: through fire shall her scum [be removed].
026	EZE	024	013	In thy uncleanness is [thy] incest; because I endeavored to cleanse thee, and thou wouldst not be clean, thou shalt not be cleansed from thy uncleanness any more, until I have assuaged my fury on thee.
026	EZE	024	014	I the Lord have spoken it; it cometh to pass, and I will do it; I will not recall my decree, and I will not have pity, nor will I repent: according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall men judge thee, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	024	015	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	024	016	Son of man, behold, I will take away from thee the desire of thy eyes by a sudden death; but thou shalt neither mourn nor weep, nor shalt thou shed a tear.
026	EZE	024	017	Sigh in silence, make no mourning for the deceased, thy bonnet bind around thy head, and thy shoes put on thy feet, and cover not thyself to thy upper lip, and eat not the bread of [other] men.
026	EZE	024	018	And when I had spoken unto the people in the morning, my wife died at evening: and I did in the morning as I had been commanded.
026	EZE	024	019	And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these things mean for us, that thou doest so?
026	EZE	024	020	And I said unto them, The word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	024	021	Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and the darling of your soul: and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left behind shall fall by the sword.
026	EZE	024	022	And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover yourselves to your upper lip, and the bread of other men shall ye not eat.
026	EZE	024	023	And your bonnets shall be around your heads, and your shoes shall be on your feet: ye shall not mourn nor shall ye weep; but ye shall pine away in your iniquities, and groan, looking one at the other.
026	EZE	024	024	Thus shall Ezekiel be unto you for a token; in accordance with all that he hath done shall ye do: when this cometh, then shall ye know that I am the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	024	025	Also, thou son of man, behold, on the day when I take from them their stronghold, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and the coveted object of their soul, their sons and their daughters, —
026	EZE	024	026	On that day there shall come one that hath escaped unto thee, and announce it to thy ears.
026	EZE	024	027	On that day shall thy mouth be opened through him that hath escaped, and thou shalt speak, and thou shalt not be silenced any more: and thou shalt be a token unto them, and they shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	025	001	And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	025	002	Son of man, set thy face against the sons of 'Ammon, and prophesy against them;
026	EZE	025	003	And say unto the sons of 'Ammon, Hear ye the word of the Lord Eternal, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Because thou hast said, Aha, concerning my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and concerning the land of Israel, when it was made desolate; and concerning the house of Judah, when they went into exile:
026	EZE	025	004	Therefore, behold, I will give thee up to the children of the east for a possession, and they shall set up their towers in thee, and place in thee their dwellings; they shall indeed eat thy fruit, and they shall surely drink thy milk.
026	EZE	025	005	And I will change Rabbah into a pasture for camels, and [the land of] the sons of 'Ammon into a resting-place for flocks: and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	025	006	For thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Whereas thou didst clap thy hands, and stamp with thy feet, and rejoice with all thy derision in the soul over the land of Israel:
026	EZE	025	007	Therefore, behold, will I stretch out my hand over thee, and will give thee up for a spoil to the nations; and I will cut thee off from the people, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries; I will destroy thee, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	025	008	Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Because Moab and Se'ir do say, Behold, the house of Judah is like all the nations:
026	EZE	025	009	Therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Beth-ha-yeshimoth, Ba'al-me'on, and Kiryathayim,
026	EZE	025	010	Unto the children of the east [coming] against the sons of 'Ammon, and I will give them in possession; in order that the sons of 'Ammon may not be remembered among the nations.
026	EZE	025	011	And on Moab will I execute judgments: and they shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	025	012	Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Because the Edomites have acted revengefully against the house of Judah, and have greatly offended, and have taken vengeance on them:
026	EZE	025	013	Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, I will also stretch out my hand against Edom, and cut off from it man and beast; and I will make it a ruined land from Theman; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword.
026	EZE	025	014	And I will display my vengeance on Edom by the hand of my people Israel; and they shall do in Edom according to my anger and according to my fury: and they shall feel my vengeance, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	025	015	Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Because the Philistines have acted in revenge, and have taken vengeance with derision in their soul, to destroy out of ancient enmity:
026	EZE	025	016	Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will stretch out my hand against the Philistines, and I will cut off the Kerethim, and destroy the remnant of the [dwellers] of the sea-coast.
026	EZE	025	017	And I will execute on them great vengeances with furious chastisements: and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I display my vengeance on them.
026	EZE	026	001	And it came to pass in the eleventh year, on the first day of the month, that the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	026	002	Son of man, because Tyre hath said concerning Jerusalem, Aha, she is broken that was the gates of the people; she is turned unto me; I shall be made full, now she is laid in ruins:
026	EZE	026	003	Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I am against thee, O Tyre, and will bring up against thee many nations, as the sea causeth its waves to come up.
026	EZE	026	004	And they shall destroy the walls of Tyre, and pull down her towers: I will also flood away her earth from her, and I will change her into a naked rock.
026	EZE	026	005	A place for the spreading out of nets shall she be in the midst of the sea; for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Eternal: and she shall become a spoil to the nations.
026	EZE	026	006	And her daughters that are in the field shall be slain with the sword: and they shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	026	007	For thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will bring against Tyre Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, from the north, the king of kings, with horses, and with chariot's, and with horsemen, and an assemblage, and a numerous people.
026	EZE	026	008	Thy daughters in the field will he slay with the sword: and he shall place around thee works of attack, and cast up against thee a mound, and erect against thee a target-fence.
026	EZE	026	009	And his catapults shall he set against thy walls, and thy towers shall he break down with his axes.
026	EZE	026	010	By reason of the abundance of his horses shall the dust they raise cover thee: by reason of the noise of horsemen, and wheels, and chariots, shall thy walls quake, when he entereth into thy gates, as men enter into a city that is broken in.
026	EZE	026	011	With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets: thy people will he slay with the sword, and the statues of thy strength shall come down to the ground.
026	EZE	026	012	And they shall plunder thy riches, and make a spoil of thy merchandise; and they shall break down thy walls, and thy pleasure-houses shall they pull down: and thy stones and thy timber and thy earth shall they throw into the midst of the water.
026	EZE	026	013	And I will cause the sound of thy songs to cease: and the tones of thy harps shall not be heard any more.
026	EZE	026	014	And I will change thee into a naked rock; a place to spread out nets upon shalt thou be; thou shalt not be rebuilt any more; for I the Lord have spoken it, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	026	015	Thus hath said the Lord Eternal to Tyre, Truly at the noise of thy fall, when the deadly wounded whine, when the slaughter taketh place in the midst of thee, shall the islands quake.
026	EZE	026	016	Then shall all the princes of the sea come down from their thrones, and lay aside their robes, and their broidered garments shall they put off: with trembling shall they clothe themselves; upon the ground shall they sit, and shall tremble at every moment, and be astonished concerning thee.
026	EZE	026	017	And they shall lift up over thee a lamentation, and say to thee, How art thou lost, that wast inhabited [safely] by reason of the seas: O renowned city, which was strong on the sea, she and her inhabitants, who caused their terror to be on all that dwelt around her!
026	EZE	026	018	Now shall the isles tremble on the day of thy fall; yea, the isles that are in the sea shall be troubled at thy end.
026	EZE	026	019	For thus hath said the Lord Eternal, When I render thee a ruined city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I bring up over thee the deep, and when the great waters cover thee:
026	EZE	026	020	Then will I bring thee down with those that descend into the pit, unto the people of olden time, and I will cause thee to dwell in the land of the nether world, among ruins of ancient days, with those that go down to the pit, in order that thou mayest not be inhabited; but I will bestow glory in the land of life.
026	EZE	026	021	As though thou hadst not been will I render thee, and thou shalt be no more: and thou shalt be sought for, but thou shalt never be found any more to eternity, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	027	001	And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	027	002	But thou, O son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyre;
026	EZE	027	003	And say unto Tyre, O thou that art situated at the entrances of the sea, the merchant of the people unto many isles, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, O Tyre, thou hast indeed said, I am perfect in beauty.
026	EZE	027	004	In the heart of the seas were thy boundaries, thy builders had perfected thy beauty.
026	EZE	027	005	Of the fir-trees from Senir had they built thee all thy woodwork: cedars from Lebanon had they taken to make masts for thee.
026	EZE	027	006	Of the oaks of Bashan had they made thy oars; thy rudder had they made inlaid with ivory of boxwood, brought out of the isles of the Kittim.
026	EZE	027	007	Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was thy flag to be unto thee a sign: of blue and purple from the isles of Ellishah was thy cover.
026	EZE	027	008	The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy oarsmen: thy wise men, O Tyre, that were in thee, these were thy pilots.
026	EZE	027	009	The elders of Gebal and her wise men were in thee thy caulkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to carry on thy commerce.
026	EZE	027	010	They of Persia and of Lud and of Put were in thy army, thy men of war: the shield and the helmet did they hang up in thee; these gave thee thy elegance.
026	EZE	027	011	The men of Arvad with thy army were upon thy walls round about, and the Gammadim were in thy towers: their quivers they hung upon thy walls round about; these made perfect thy beauty.
026	EZE	027	012	Tharshish was thy merchant through the abundance of all kind of wealth: with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they supplied thy markets.
026	EZE	027	013	Javan, Thubal, and Meshech; these were thy merchants: with the persons of men and vessels of copper they carried on thy commerce.
026	EZE	027	014	They of the family of Thogarmah furnished thy supplies in horses and horsemen and mules.
026	EZE	027	015	The men of Dedan were thy merchants; many isles fetched the merchandise from thy place: chamois horns, ivory, and ebony did they bring as presents for thee.
026	EZE	027	016	Syria was thy trader by reason of the multitude of thy productions: with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and rubies they made deposits in thy treasuries.
026	EZE	027	017	Judah, and the land of Israel, these were thy merchants: in wheat of Minnith, and balsam, and honey, and oil, and balm they carried on thy commerce.
026	EZE	027	018	Damascus was thy trader in the multitude of thy productions, for the multitude of all wealth, with the wine of Chelbon, and white wool.
026	EZE	027	019	Dan also and Javan brought silken goods into thy warehouses: hardened iron, cassia, and calamus came among thy commerce.
026	EZE	027	020	Dedan was thy merchant in precious clothes for riding on.
026	EZE	027	021	Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, these were the traders of thy place in lambs, and wethers, and he-goats: in these were they thy traders.
026	EZE	027	022	The merchants of Sheba and Ra'mah, —these were thy merchants: in the best of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold, they furnished thy supplies.
026	EZE	027	023	Charan, and Canneh, and 'Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, [and] Kilmad, were thy merchants.
026	EZE	027	024	These were thy merchants in ornamental wares, in cloaks of blue, and broidered work, and in chests of damask cloth, bound with cords, and packed in cedar, in thy market-place.
026	EZE	027	025	The ships of Tharshish were thy caravans in thy commerce: and thou wast made full, and becamest very rich in the heart of the seas.
026	EZE	027	026	Into great waters brought thee those that were thy rowers: the east wind hath broken thee in the heart of the seas.
026	EZE	027	027	Thy wealth, and thy warehouses, thy commerce, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy caulkers, and the conductors of thy commerce, and all thy men of war that were in thee, and in all thy assemblage which was in the midst of thee, fell into the heart of the seas on the day of thy downfall.
026	EZE	027	028	At the sound of the painful cry of thy pilots quake [thy] rural districts.
026	EZE	027	029	And all that handle the oar, the mariners, and all the pilots of the sea, come down from their ships, they stand upon the land;
026	EZE	027	030	And cause their voice to be heard concerning thee, and cry bitterly, and cast up dust upon their heads, they wallow in the ashes;
026	EZE	027	031	And they make themselves utterly bald for thee, and gird themselves with sackcloth, and they weep for thee with bitterness of heart in a bitter complaint.
026	EZE	027	032	And they take in their wailing a lamentation for thee, and lament over thee, saying, Who is like Tyre, who is so utterly destroyed in the midst of the sea?
026	EZE	027	033	When thy supplies went forth out of the seas, thou didst satisfy many people: with the multitude of thy wealth and of thy commerce thou didst enrich the kings of the earth.
026	EZE	027	034	[Now] at the time thou art broken by the seas in the depths of the waters, thy commerce and all thy assemblage fell in the midst of thee.
026	EZE	027	035	All the inhabitants of the isles are astonished at thee, and the hair of their kings stand at an end, grieved are their countenances.
026	EZE	027	036	The traders among the people shall hiss concerning thee: thou wast rendered as though thou hadst not been, and thou shalt not be any more for ever.
026	EZE	028	001	And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	028	002	Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyre, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Whereas thy heart was lifted up, and thou saidst, A god am I, on the seat of the gods do I dwell, in the heart of the seas; yet thou art but a man, and not God, while thou esteemest thy mind equal to the mind of God;
026	EZE	028	003	Behold, thou wast wiser than Daniel; no secret was obscure to thee;
026	EZE	028	004	With thy wisdom and with thy understanding hadst thou gotten thee riches, and hadst gotten gold and silver into thy treasuries;
026	EZE	028	005	By the abundance of thy wisdom in thy traffic hadst thou increased thy riches; and thy heart was lifted up because of thy riches:
026	EZE	028	006	Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Because thou hast esteemed thy mind equal to the mind of God,
026	EZE	028	007	Therefore, behold, will I bring over thee strangers, the fiercest • of nations; and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall profane thy elegance.
026	EZE	028	008	Down to the grave will they cast thee, and thou shalt die the deaths of the slain in the heart of the seas.
026	EZE	028	009	Wilt thou then say, I am God, before him that slayeth thee? when thou art but a man, and no God, in the hand of him that fatally wounded thee.
026	EZE	028	010	The deaths of the uncircumcised shalt thou die by the hand of strangers; for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	028	011	And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	028	012	Son of man, take up a lamentation concerning the king of Tyre, and say unto him, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Thou wast complete in outline, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.
026	EZE	028	013	In 'Eden the garden of God didst thou abide; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, the topaz, and the diamond, the chrysolite, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold; thy tabrets and thy flutes of artificial workmanship were prepared in thee on the day thou wast created.
026	EZE	028	014	Thou wast a cherub with outspread covering [wings]; and I had set thee upon the holy mountain of God [as] thou wast; in the midst of the stones of fire didst thou wander.
026	EZE	028	015	Perfect wast thou in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till wickedness was found in thee.
026	EZE	028	016	By the abundance of thy commerce thou wast filled to thy centre with violence, and thou didst sin: therefore I degraded thee out of the mountain of God; and I destroyed thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.
026	EZE	028	017	Thy heart was lifted up through thy beauty, thou didst corrupt thy wisdom by reason of thy elegance: [therefore] I cast thee down to the ground, before kings did I set thee that they might gaze on thee.
026	EZE	028	018	Through the abundance of thy iniquities, through the wickedness of thy commerce didst thou profane thy sanctuaries: therefore brought I forth fire from the midst of thee, this devoured thee, and I changed thee to ashes upon the earth before the eyes of all those that saw thee.
026	EZE	028	019	All that know thee among the people are astonished concerning thee: thou art as though thou hadst not been, and thou shalt not be any more for ever.
026	EZE	028	020	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
026	EZE	028	021	Son of man, set thy face against Zidon, and prophesy against it,
026	EZE	028	022	And thou shalt say, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I am against thee, O Zidon, and I will be honored in the midst of thee: and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I execute judgments on her, and will be sanctified on her.
026	EZE	028	023	And I will send out against her pestilence, and blood-[shedding] into her streets; and the deadly wounded shall be felled in the midst of her by the sword [that is] against her from every side: and they shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	028	024	And there shall be no more unto the house of Israel a pricking brier, nor painful thorn from all that are round about them, that despoil them: and they shall know that I am the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	028	025	Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, When I gather the house of Israel from the people among whom they are scattered, and shall be sanctified on them before the eyes of the nations: then shall they dwell in their land that I have given to my servant Jacob.
026	EZE	028	026	And they shall dwell thereupon in safety, and they shall build houses, and plant vineyards; yea, they shall dwell in safety; when I execute judgments on all those that despoiled them from round about them: and they shall know that I am the Lord their God.
026	EZE	029	001	In the tenth year, in the tenth month, on the twelfth day of the month, came the word of the Lord unto me, saying,
026	EZE	029	002	Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt.
026	EZE	029	003	Speak and say, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will be against thee, O Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great crocodile that lieth in the midst of his streams, who hath said, Mine is my stream, and I have made it for myself.
026	EZE	029	004	But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will fasten the fish of thy streams on thy scales; and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy streams, with all the fish of thy streams which shall stick fast on thy scales.
026	EZE	029	005	And I will cast thee out into the wilderness, thee with all the fish of thy streams; upon the open field shalt thou fall; thou shalt not be brought in, nor gathered up: to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven have I given thee for food.
026	EZE	029	006	And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the Lord; because they have been a reed-staff to the house of Israel.
026	EZE	029	007	When they took hold of thee with the hand, thou wast cracked, and didst rend for them all the shoulder: and when they leaned upon thee, thou wast broken, and madest all their loins to be at a stand.
026	EZE	029	008	Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will bring a sword upon thee, and I will cut off out of thee man and beast.
026	EZE	029	009	And the land of Egypt shall be changed into a waste and ruin, and they shall know that I am the Lord; because he hath said, The stream is mine, and I have made it.
026	EZE	029	010	Therefore, behold, I will be against thee, and against thy streams, and I will render the land of Egypt a mass of ruins, a waste, and a wilderness, from Migdol to Seveneh even up to the border of Ethiopia.
026	EZE	029	011	There shall not pass through it the foot of man, and the foot of beast shall not pass through it, and it shall not be inhabited forty years.
026	EZE	029	012	And I will render the land of Egypt a desolate land in the midst of desolated countries, and her cities among the cities that are ruined shall be desolate forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.
026	EZE	029	013	For thus hath said the Lord Eternal, [only] at the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the people whither they shall have been scattered;
026	EZE	029	014	And I will bring back the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their own origin: and they shall be there an unimportant kingdom.
026	EZE	029	015	Among the kingdoms it shall be the lowest; neither shall it raise itself any more above the nations: and I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.
026	EZE	029	016	And it shall be no more unto the house of Israel for a dependence, bringing [their] iniquity to remembrance, when they turned after them: and they shall know that I am the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	029	017	And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first month, on the first of the month, that the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	029	018	Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath caused his army to perform a great service against Tyre; every head hath been made bald, and every shoulder hath been rubbed sore: yet no reward hath come to him or to his army from Tyre, for the service that he hath performed against it.
026	EZE	029	019	Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will give unto Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon the land of Egypt; and he shall carry away its multitude, and take its spoil, and plunder its prey: and this shall be the reward for his army.
026	EZE	029	020	As his recompense for that which he hath served against it, have I given him the land of Egypt, for that which they had done against me, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	029	021	On that day will I cause to grow a horn for the house of Israel, and unto thee will I open the mouth in the midst of them: and they shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	030	001	And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	030	002	Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Wail ye, Woe unto the day!
026	EZE	030	003	For nigh is the day, yea nigh is the day of the Lord; a cloudy day; the time of the nations' [misfortune] shall it be.
026	EZE	030	004	And the sword shall come into Egypt, and there shall be trembling in Ethiopia, when the slain fall in Egypt, and when they take away its multitude, and its foundations shall be broken down.
026	EZE	030	005	Ethiopia, and Put, and Lud, and all the confederates, and Cub, and all the men of the leagued land, shall fall with them by the sword.
026	EZE	030	006	Thus hath said the Lord, Yea, there shall fall those that uphold Egypt; and there shall come down the pride of her strength: from Migdol to Seveneh shall they fall in her by the sword, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	030	007	And they shall be made desolate in the midst of the desolate countries, and its cities shall be counted in the midst of the cities that have been laid in ruins.
026	EZE	030	008	And they shall know that I am the Lord, when I set fire to Egypt, and when all her helpers shall be broken.
026	EZE	030	009	On that day shall messengers go forth from my presence in ships to terrify the secure Ethiopians, and there shall be trembling among them, as on the day of Egypt; for, lo, it cometh.
026	EZE	030	010	Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, I will also cause the multitude of Egypt to cease through the hand of Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon.
026	EZE	030	011	He and his people with him, the fiercest of nations, shall be brought to destroy the land; and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and they shall fill the land with the slain.
026	EZE	030	012	And I will render the streams dry, and sell the land into the hand of evil men; and I will make the land desolate, and all that filleth it, by the hand of strangers: I the Lord have spoken it.
026	EZE	030	013	Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, I will also destroy the idols, and I will cause false gods to cease out of Noph; and a prince out of the land of Egypt shall there not be any more: and I will lay fear on the land of Egypt.
026	EZE	030	014	And I will make Pathros desolate, and set fire to Zo'an; and I will execute judgments in No.
026	EZE	030	015	And I will pour my fury over Sin, the stronghold of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No.
026	EZE	030	016	And I will set fire to Egypt: Sin shall have great pain, and No shall be broken in, and [over] Noph shall the besiegers [prevail] by broad day.
026	EZE	030	017	The young men of Aven and of Pi-besseth shall fall by the sword; and they themselves shall go into captivity.
026	EZE	030	018	And at Thechaphneches the day shall be darkened, when I break there the yoke-bars of Egypt, and the pride of her strength ceaseth therein: as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity.
026	EZE	030	019	Thus will I execute judgments on Egypt: and they shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	030	020	And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, on the seventh day of the month, that the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	030	021	Son of man, the arm of Pharaoh the king of Egypt have I broken; and lo, it shall not be bound up to apply remedies, to put on a bandage to bind it up, to make it strong that it may grasp the sword.
026	EZE	030	022	Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will be against Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and will break his arms, both the strong, and that which was already broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.
026	EZE	030	023	And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and I will disperse them through the countries.
026	EZE	030	024	And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and will put my sword in his hand; but I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he shall groan, with the groanings of a deadly wounded man before him.
026	EZE	030	025	Yea I will make strong the arms of the king of Babylon, but the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down: and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I place my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, that he may stretch it out over the land of Egypt.
026	EZE	030	026	And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them among the countries: and they shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	031	001	And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, on the first day of the month, that the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	031	002	Son of man, say unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and to his multitude, Unto whom art thou like in thy arrogance?
026	EZE	031	003	Behold, Asshur was a cedar in Lebanon beautiful in its boughs, and a shadowing thicket, and high in stature; and among the thick-boughed trees was its highest branch.
026	EZE	031	004	The waters made it great, the deep made it high, with its rivers it was flowing round the place where it was planted, and its ditches it sent forth unto all the trees of the field.
026	EZE	031	005	Therefore became its stature higher than all the trees of the field, and its boughs were multiplied, and its branches became long because of the multitude of waters, when it stretched itself forth.
026	EZE	031	006	In its boughs made all the fowls of heaven their nest, and under its branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under its shade dwelt all great nations.
026	EZE	031	007	And it was beautiful in its greatness, in the length of its light branches; for its root was by many waters.
026	EZE	031	008	The cedars could not obscure it in the garden of God; the firs were not like its boughs, and the chestnut-trees were not like its branches: not any tree in the garden of God was like unto it in its beauty.
026	EZE	031	009	Beautiful had I made it by the multitude of its light branches: so that all the trees of 'Eden that were in the garden of God, envied it.
026	EZE	031	010	Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Because thou wast so high in stature, and it had placed its highest branch between the thick-boughed trees, and its heart was lifted up through its height:
026	EZE	031	011	Therefore do I give it up into the hand of the mighty one of the nations; he shall surely deal with it at his pleasure; for its wickedness do I drive it out.
026	EZE	031	012	And strangers, the fiercest of nations, cut it down, and cast it to the ground: on the mountains and in all the valleys fall its light branches, and its boughs are [lying] broken in all the ravines of the land; and all the people of the earth are gone away from its shade, and have cast it to the ground.
026	EZE	031	013	Upon its fallen fragments dwell all the fowls of the heaven, and on its branches are all the beasts of the field:
026	EZE	031	014	In order that none of all the trees by the waters shall exalt themselves for their height, nor place their highest branch among the thick-boughed trees, and that all those that are nourished by water shall not place themselves erect, because of their height; for they are all given up unto death, to the land of the nether world, in the midst of the children of men, with those that go down to the pit.
026	EZE	031	015	Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, On the day when it went down to the grave I caused a mourning; I covered the deep for its sake, and I restrained its rivers, and the great waters were withheld; and I caused Lebanon to be clothed in black attire for its sake, and all the trees of the field were famished because of it.
026	EZE	031	016	Through the noise of its downfall I caused nations to quake, when I cast it down into the tomb with the [others] that descend into the pit: and in the land of the nether world comforted themselves all the trees of 'Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that were nourished by water.
026	EZE	031	017	They also went down with it into the tomb unto those that were slain with the sword, and its helpers that had dwelt under its shade in the midst of the nations.
026	EZE	031	018	To whom art thou then like in glory and in greatness among the trees of 'Eden? And thou too shalt be brought down with the trees of 'Eden unto the land of the nether world: in the midst of the uncircumcised shalt thou lie with those slain by the sword; yes, he, Pharaoh, and all his multitude, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	032	001	And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the first day of the month, that the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	032	002	Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and say unto him, Thou didst deem thyself like a young lion among the nations: while thou art as a crocodile in the seas; and thou issuedst forth with thy rivers, and madest turbid the waters with thy feet, and didst stir up their rivers.
026	EZE	032	003	Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, I will therefore spread out my net over thee through the assemblage of many people, and they shall draw thee up in my net.
026	EZE	032	004	Then will I cast thee upon the land, upon the open field will I hurl thee, and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to dwell upon thee, and I will satisfy off thee the beasts of all the earth.
026	EZE	032	005	And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with thy carcass.
026	EZE	032	006	I will also saturate the land wherein thou swimmest with thy blood, even to the mountains; and the ravines shall be full of thee.
026	EZE	032	007	And I will cover up the heavens, when thou art quenched, and make their stars obscure: the sun will I cover up with a cloud, and the moon shall not let shine her light.
026	EZE	032	008	All the light-dispensing lights of the heavens—these will I make obscure because of thee, and I will lay darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	032	009	And I will aggrieve the heart of many people, when I bring those who are broken off from thee among the nations, into countries which thou hast not known.
026	EZE	032	010	Yea, I will make many people amazed at thee, and on their kings the hair shall stand on end because of thee, when I brandish my sword before their faces: and they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his own life, on the day of thy downfall.
026	EZE	032	011	For thus hath said the Lord Eternal, The sword of the king of Babylon shall come over thee.
026	EZE	032	012	By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall, the fiercest of nations are all of them: and they shall destroy the pride of Egypt, and all her multitude shall be annihilated.
026	EZE	032	013	And I will cause to vanish all her beasts from beside the great waters; and the foot of man shall not make them turbid any more, nor shall the hoofs of beasts make them turbid.
026	EZE	032	014	Then will I make clear their waters, and cause their rivers to flow like oil, saith the Lord Eternal;
026	EZE	032	015	When I render the land of Egypt desolate and wasted, the country bereft of what now filleth it, when I smite all those that dwell therein: and they shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	032	016	This is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament for her; the daughters of the nations shall lament for her: for Egypt, and for all her multitude, shall they lament with it, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	032	017	And it came to pass in the twelfth year, on the fifteenth day of the month, that the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	032	018	Son of man, moan for the multitude of Egypt, and say that it shall go down, yea, she, and the daughters of powerful nations, unto the land of the nether world, with those that go down to the pit.
026	EZE	032	019	Whom dost thou surpass in loveliness? go down [then], and be thou laid with the [other] uncircumcised.
026	EZE	032	020	In the midst of those that are slain by the sword shall they fall: to the sword is she given up; drag her away and all her multitudes.
026	EZE	032	021	Then will speak of him the strongest among the mighty out of the midst of the nether world with those that once helped him, They are gone down, there lie the uncircumcised, —slain by the sword.
026	EZE	032	022	There is Asshur and all his assemblage; round about him are his graves; all of them the slain that are fallen by the sword;
026	EZE	032	023	Whose graves are placed in the lowest depth of the pit, and his assemblage is round about his grave; all of them are slain, fallen by the sword, who once spread terror in the land of the living.
026	EZE	032	024	There is 'Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all of them the slain, that are fallen by the sword, who are gone down uncircumcised into the land of the nether world, who once spread their terror in the land of the living; and they have borne their confusion with those that go down to the pit.
026	EZE	032	025	In the midst of the slain have they set a couch for her with all her multitude; all round about are her graves; all of them are uncircumcised, slain by the sword; because their terror was once spread in the land of the living; and they have borne their confusion with those that go down to the pit: in the midst of the slain was she placed.
026	EZE	032	026	There is Meshech, Thubal, and all her multitude; all round about her are her graves: all of them are the uncircumcised, slain by the sword; because they once spread their terror in the land of the living.
026	EZE	032	027	And those who are fallen of the uncircumcised shall not lie with the mighty, who are gone down to the nether world with their weapons of war, while men laid their swords under their heads, and the [instruments of] their iniquities were upon their bones; for the terror of the mighty was in the land of the living.
026	EZE	032	028	But thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and shalt lie with those that are slain by the sword.
026	EZE	032	029	There are Edom, her kings, and all her princes, who are laid despite their prowess by those that are slain by the sword: they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with those that go down to the pit.
026	EZE	032	030	There are the chieftains of the north, all of them, and all the Zidonians, who are gone down with the slain: despite the terror they excited through their prowess are they made ashamed; and they lie uncircumcised with those that are slain by the sword, and bear their confusion with those that go down to the pit.
026	EZE	032	031	These shall Pharaoh see, and he shall be comforted over all his multitude: slain by the sword are Pharaoh and all his army, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	032	032	For I spread my terror in the land of the living; and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with those that are slain by the sword, —yea, Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	033	001	And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	033	002	Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, If there be a land over which I bring the sword, and the people of the land take a man from among themselves, and appoint him unto themselves for a watchman;
026	EZE	033	003	And if he see the sword coming over the land, and blow the cornet, and warn the people;
026	EZE	033	004	And whosoever heareth the sound of the cornet, and taketh no warning; and the sword cometh, and taketh him away: his blood shall be upon his own head.
026	EZE	033	005	The sound of the cornet hath he heard, and he hath taken no warning; his blood shall be upon him. But had he taken warning he would have delivered his soul.
026	EZE	033	006	But if the watchman see the sword coming, and blow not the cornet, so that the people be not warned, and the sword cometh, and taketh away from among them some person: this one is taken away for his iniquity; but his blood will I require from the watchman's hand.
026	EZE	033	007	But as for thee, O son of man, I have appointed thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: so that when thou hearest a word from my mouth, thou shalt warn them from me.
026	EZE	033	008	When I say unto the wicked, O wicked one, thou shalt surely die; and thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way: that wicked one shall die for his iniquity; but his blood will I require from thy hand.
026	EZE	033	009	Nevertheless, if thou hast indeed warned the wicked of his way to turn away from it, and he do not turn from his way: he shall certainly die for his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.
026	EZE	033	010	But thou, O son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, Thus do ye speak, saying, Truly our transgressions and our sins are upon us, and through them do we pine away: how then shall we live?
026	EZE	033	011	Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord Eternal, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but in the return of the wicked from his way that he may live: return ye, return ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?
026	EZE	033	012	But thou, son of man, say unto the children of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him on the day of his transgression; and as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not stumble through it on the day that he returneth from his wickedness; nor shall the righteous be able to live through the other on the day that he sinneth.
026	EZE	033	013	When I say of the righteous, that he shall surely live, and he trusteth to his own righteousness, and committeth what is wrong: all his righteous deeds shall not be remembered, and for his wrong that he hath committed, —through this shall he die.
026	EZE	033	014	Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and he turneth from his sin, and executeth justice and righteousness;
026	EZE	033	015	If the wicked restore the pledge, make restitution for what he hath robbed, walk in the statutes of life, so as not to do any wrong: he shall surely live, he shall not die.
026	EZE	033	016	All his sins that he hath committed shall not be remembered unto him: justice and righteousness hath he executed, he shall surely live.
026	EZE	033	017	Yet say the children of thy people, The way of the Lord is not equitable: while, as to them, their way is not equitable.
026	EZE	033	018	When the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and doth what is wrong, he shall even die therefore.
026	EZE	033	019	And when the wicked returneth from his wickedness, and executeth justice and righteousness, he shall surely live therefore.
026	EZE	033	020	Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equitable. Every one after his own ways will I judge you, O house of Israel.
026	EZE	033	021	And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the tenth month, on the fifth day of the month after our exile, that there came unto me one that had escaped out of Jerusalem, saying, The city hath been smitten.
026	EZE	033	022	Now the inspiration of the Lord was come upon me in the evening, before the coming of the one who had escaped; and he had opened my mouth, before he was come to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened and I was not kept dumb any more.
026	EZE	033	023	And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	033	024	Son of man, they that dwell in these ruins in the land of Israel say as followeth, But one man was Abraham, and he obtained the land as an inheritance; and as we are many, the land must [surely] be given to us for an inheritance.
026	EZE	033	025	Therefore say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, By the blood do ye eat, and your eyes do you lift up toward your idols, and blood do ye shed: and ye expect to possess the land?
026	EZE	033	026	Ye depend upon your sword, ye commit abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbor's wife: and ye expect to possess the land?
026	EZE	033	027	Thus shalt thou say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, As I live, surely those that are in the ruined places shall fall by the sword, and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts that they may devour him, and those that are in the strongholds and in the caves shall die through the pestilence.
026	EZE	033	028	And I will render the land desolate and wasted, and the pride of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, with none to pass through them.
026	EZE	033	029	And they shall experience that I am the Lord, when I render the land desolate and wasted, because of all their abominations which they have committed.
026	EZE	033	030	And thou, son of man, [there are] the children of thy people, who are talking about thee by the walls and in the entrances of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Do come, and hear what the word is which cometh forth from the Lord.
026	EZE	033	031	And then they come unto thee as the people come, and they sit before thee [as] my people, and they hear thy words, but do not execute them; for as merry songs they carry them in their mouth, while their heart goeth after their unlawful gains.
026	EZE	033	032	And, lo, thou art unto them as a merry song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well: and [thus] they hear thy words, but execute them not.
026	EZE	033	033	But when it cometh to pass, [lo, it will come,] then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them.
026	EZE	034	001	And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	034	002	Son of man, prophesy concerning the shepherds of Israel; prophesy, and say unto them, unto the shepherds, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Woe to the shepherds of Israel who do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the flocks?
026	EZE	034	003	The fat ye eat, and with the wool ye clothe yourselves, those that are well fed ye slaughter; but the flock ye feed not.
026	EZE	034	004	The diseased have ye not strengthened, and the sick have ye not healed, and that which had a limb broken have ye not bound up, and the strayed have ye not brought back again, and what was lost have ye not sought for; but with force have ye ruled them and with rigor.
026	EZE	034	005	And they were scattered for want of a shepherd; and they became food unto all the beasts of the field, and they were scattered.
026	EZE	034	006	My sheep have to wander about on all the mountains, and upon every high hill: yea, over all the face of the land are my flock scattered, and there is none that inquireth and none that seeketh [after them].
026	EZE	034	007	Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the Lord,
026	EZE	034	008	As I live, saith the Lord Eternal, surely because my flock became a prey, and my flock became food unto every beast of the field, because there was no shepherd, and my shepherds did not inquire for my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and my flock they fed not:
026	EZE	034	009	Therefore, O ye shepherds, hear the word of the Lord,
026	EZE	034	010	Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will be against the shepherds, and I will require my flock from their hand, and I will stop them from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more: and I will deliver my flock out of their mouth, that they may not serve them for food.
026	EZE	034	011	For thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I am here, and I will both inquire for my flocks, and search for them.
026	EZE	034	012	As a shepherd searcheth for his flock on the day that he is among his flocks that are scattered: so will I search for my flocks; and I will deliver them out of all places whither they have been scattered on the day of clouds and [tempestuous] darkness.
026	EZE	034	013	And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from the countries, and I will bring them to their own land; and I will feed them upon the mountains of Israel, in the ravines, and in all the inhabited places of the country.
026	EZE	034	014	On a good pasture will I feed them, and upon the high mountains of Israel shall be their fold: there shall they lie in a good fold, and in a fat pasture shall they feed on the mountains of Israel.
026	EZE	034	015	I myself will feed my flock, and I myself will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	034	016	That which was lost will I seek for, and that which was gone astray will I bring back again, and that which had a limb broken will I bind up, and the sick will I strengthen: but the fat and the strong will I destroy; I will feed them in justice.
026	EZE	034	017	And as for you, O my flock, thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will judge between lamb and lamb, between the wethers and the he-goats.
026	EZE	034	018	Is it too little for you that ye can feed on the good pasture, that ye must tread down the residue of your pastures with your feet? and that ye can drink clear waters, that ye must render muddy with your feet what is left?
026	EZE	034	019	And as for my flock, what ye have trodden with your feet must they eat; and what ye have made muddy with your feet must they drink.
026	EZE	034	020	Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal unto them, Behold, I am here, and I will judge between the fat lamb and the lean lamb.
026	EZE	034	021	Because ye thrust with side and with shoulder, and push with your horns all the diseased, till ye have scattered them abroad:
026	EZE	034	022	Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between lamb and lamb.
026	EZE	034	023	And I will appoint over them one shepherd, and he shall feed them, namely, my servant David: he it is that shall feed them, and he it is that shall be unto them for a shepherd.
026	EZE	034	024	And I the Lord—I will be unto them for a God, and my servant David shall be a prince in their midst: I the Lord have spoken it.
026	EZE	034	025	And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and I will cause the wild beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall dwell in the wilderness in safety, and sleep in the forests.
026	EZE	034	026	And I will make them and the environs of my hill a blessing; and I will cause the rain to come down in its season; rains of blessing shall they be.
026	EZE	034	027	And the tree of the field shall yield its fruit, and the earth shall yield her products, and they shall be on their land in safety: and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I break the bands of their yoke, and deliver them out of the hand of those that had made them labor for them.
026	EZE	034	028	And they shall be no more a prey to the nations, and the beasts of the land shall not devour them; but they shall dwell in safety, with none to make them afraid.
026	EZE	034	029	And I will raise up for them a plantation for a [perpetual] renown, and they shall be no more taken away by hunger in the land, neither bear the shameful reproach of the nations any more.
026	EZE	034	030	Thus shall they experience that I the Lord their God am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are my people, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	034	031	And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men, [and] I am your God, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	035	001	And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	035	002	Son of man, set thy face against the mountain of Se'ir, and prophecy against it,
026	EZE	035	003	And say unto it, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will be against thee, O mountain of Se'ir, and I will stretch out my hand over thee, and I will render thee desolate and wasted.
026	EZE	035	004	Thy cities will I lay in ruins, and thou thyself shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	035	005	Because thou hast had an undying hatred, and didst surrender the children of Israel to the power of the sword, at the time of their calamity, at the time of the iniquity of the end:
026	EZE	035	006	Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord Eternal, I will surely let thy blood flow, and blood shall pursue thee; since thou didst not hate blood-shedding, so shall blood pursue thee.
026	EZE	035	007	Thus will I change the mountain of Se'ir into a desolate land and a waste, and I will cut off from it him that travelleth forward and backward.
026	EZE	035	008	And I will fill his mountains with his slain: as regardeth thy hills, and thy valleys, and all thy ravines, in them shall fall those that are slain by the sword.
026	EZE	035	009	Into perpetual desolations will I change thee, and thy cities shall not be restored: and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	035	010	Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall indeed be mine, and we will take possession thereof; whereas the Lord was there:
026	EZE	035	011	Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord God, I will even do according to thy anger, and according to thy envy which thou didst use out of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I judge thee.
026	EZE	035	012	And thou shalt know that I am the Lord: I have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given unto us to consume them.
026	EZE	035	013	And ye boasted greatly against me with your mouth, and have multiplied against me your words: I have indeed heard them.
026	EZE	035	014	Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make thee desolate.
026	EZE	035	015	As thou didst rejoice over the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was made desolate: so will I do unto thee; desolate shalt thou be, O mountain of Se'ir, and all Idumea—altogether; and they shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	036	001	But thou, son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel, and say, O mountains of Israel, hear ye the word of the Lord.
026	EZE	036	002	Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Because the enemy hath said regarding you, Aha, even the ancient high-places are become ours as a possession:
026	EZE	036	003	Therefore prophesy and say, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Because, even because men have made you desolate, and sought to swallow you up on every side, that ye might become a possession unto the residue of the nations, and ye are taken up as a talk for tongues, and an evil report of the people:
026	EZE	036	004	Therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear ye the word of the Lord Eternal, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal to the mountains, and to the hills, to the ravines, and to the valleys, to the desolate ruins, and to the cities that are forsaken, which are become a prey and derision to the residue of the nations that are round about:
026	EZE	036	005	Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the nations, and against all Idumea, that have appropriated my land unto themselves as a possession with the joy of all their heart, with derision in their soul, in order to drive it out that it may be for a prey.
026	EZE	036	006	Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say unto the mountains, and to the hills, to the ravines, and to the valleys, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, In my zealousness and in my fury have I spoken, because ye have borne the reproach of the nations:
026	EZE	036	007	Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, I have indeed lifted up my hand, that the nations who are round about you— these shall bear their shame.
026	EZE	036	008	But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall send forth your boughs, and your fruit shall ye bear for my people Israel, for they are near at hand to come.
026	EZE	036	009	For, behold, I will be for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye shall be tilled and ye shall be sown;
026	EZE	036	010	And I will multiply upon you men, all the house of Israel— altogether; and the cities shall be inhabited again, and the ruins shall be rebuilt;
026	EZE	036	011	And I will multiply upon you men and beast, and they shall increase and be fruitful; and I will cause you to be inhabited after your old estates, and will do more good unto you than at your beginnings: and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	036	012	Yea, I will cause to walk upon you men, even my people Israel, and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be unto them as an inheritance, and thou shalt not any more henceforth cast them out.
026	EZE	036	013	Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Because they say unto you, Thou land devourest up men, and hast been one that hath ever cast out thy nations:
026	EZE	036	014	Therefore shalt thou not devour up men any more, and thy nations shalt thou not cast out any more, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	036	015	And I will not let be heard against thee any more the reproach of the nations, and the disgrace of the people shalt thou not bear any more, and thy nations shalt thou not cast out any more, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	036	016	And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	036	017	Son of man, the house of Israel, when they dwelt in their own land, defiled it through their way and through their doings: like the uncleanness of a woman in her separation was their way before me.
026	EZE	036	018	And I poured out my fury over them because of the blood that they had shed in the land, and because through their idols they had polluted it;
026	EZE	036	019	And I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way and according to their doings did I judge them.
026	EZE	036	020	And when they were come unto the nations, whither they were gone, they profaned my holy name; because they said of them, These are the people of the Lord, and out of his land are they gone forth.
026	EZE	036	021	But I had pity for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations, whither they were gone.
026	EZE	036	022	Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Not for your sake do I this, O house of Israel, but for the sake of my holy name, which ye have profaned among the nations, whither ye are gone.
026	EZE	036	023	And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the nations, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the nations shall know that I am the Lord, saith the Lord Eternal, when I will be sanctified through you before your eyes.
026	EZE	036	024	And I will take you from among the nations, and I will gather you out of all the countries, and I will bring you unto your own land.
026	EZE	036	025	And I will sprinkle upon you clean water, and ye shall be clean: from all your impurities, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.
026	EZE	036	026	And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit will I put within you; and I will remove the heart of stone out of your body, and I will give you a heart of flesh.
026	EZE	036	027	And my spirit I will put within you, and I will cause that you shall walk in my statutes, and that my ordinances ye shall keep, and do them.
026	EZE	036	028	And ye shall dwell in the land which I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be unto me for a people, and I truly will be unto you as a God.
026	EZE	036	029	And I will save you from all kinds of your impurities; and I will call unto the corn, and increase it, and I will not lay famine upon you.
026	EZE	036	030	And I will multiply the fruit of the trees, and the products of the field: in order that ye may receive no more reproach on account of famine among the nations.
026	EZE	036	031	Then shall ye remember your ways that they were evil, and your doings that were not good; and ye shall loathe yourselves on account of your iniquities and on account of your abominations.
026	EZE	036	032	Not for your sake do I this, saith the Lord Eternal, be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded because of your ways, O house of Israel.
026	EZE	036	033	Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, On the day of my cleansing you from all your iniquities, when I cause the cities to be inhabited, and when the ruins are built up,
026	EZE	036	034	And when the desolate land is tilled, instead that it was a waste before the eyes of every passer by:
026	EZE	036	035	Then shall they say, This land, that was desolate, is become like the garden of 'Eden; and the cities that were ruined, and desolate, and broken down, are become fortified, and inhabited.
026	EZE	036	036	And the nations that are left round about you shall know that I the Lord have built up the broken-down [places], have planted the desolate [land]: I the Lord have spoken this, and have done it.
026	EZE	036	037	Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Also in this will I yet suffer myself to be entreated of by the house of Israel, to do it for them, I will increase them with men like flocks [in multitude].
026	EZE	036	038	As the flocks of the holy things, as the flocks of Jerusalem on her appointed feasts, so shall the ruined cities be full of flocks of men: and they shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	037	001	There came over me the inspiration of the Lord, and he carried me out in the spirit of the Lord, and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones;
026	EZE	037	002	And he caused me to pass by them all round about; and, behold, there were very many of them on the surface of the valley; and, lo, they were very dry.
026	EZE	037	003	And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live! And I said, O Lord Eternal, thou alone knowest this.
026	EZE	037	004	And he said unto me, Prophesy over these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear ye the word of the Lord.
026	EZE	037	005	Thus hath said the Lord Eternal unto these bones, Behold, I will bring a spirit into you, and ye shall live;
026	EZE	037	006	And I will lay sinews upon you, and bring up flesh upon you, and draw over you a skin, and put a spirit in you, and ye shall live: and ye shall experience that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	037	007	And so I prophesied as I had been commanded: and there was a sound, as I prophesied, and behold there was a rustling noise, and the bones came together, bone to its bone.
026	EZE	037	008	And I looked, and behold, there were sinews upon them, and the flesh came up, and the skin was drawn over them above; but no spirit was in them.
026	EZE	037	009	Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the spirit; prophesy, son of man, and say to the spirit, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, From the four winds come, O spirit, and breathe into these slain ones, that they may live.
026	EZE	037	010	And I prophesied as he had commanded me, and there came into them the spirit, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceedingly great army.
026	EZE	037	011	Then said he unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Dried are our bones, and lost is our hope; we are quite cut off.
026	EZE	037	012	Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will open your graves, and I will cause you to come up out of your graves, O my people, and I will bring you into the land of Israel.
026	EZE	037	013	And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I open your graves, and when I cause you to come up out of your graves, O my people.
026	EZE	037	014	And I will put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I will place you in your own land: and ye shall acknowledge that I the Lord have spoken it, and done it, saith the Lord.
026	EZE	037	015	And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	037	016	But thou, son of man, take unto thyself one stick of wood, and write upon it, “For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions;” then take another stick, and write upon it, “For Joseph, —the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions:”
026	EZE	037	017	And join them one to the other unto thee as one stick; and they shall become one in thy hand.
026	EZE	037	018	And if the children of thy people should say unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not tell us what thou meanest by these?
026	EZE	037	019	[Then] speak unto them, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, —which is in the hand of Ephraim, —and the tribes of Israel his companions, and will lay them upon him, even the stick of Judah, and make them into one stick, and they shall be one in my hand.
026	EZE	037	020	And the sticks whereon thou shalt have written shall be in thy hand before their eyes.
026	EZE	037	021	And speak unto them, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, whither they are gone, and I will gather them from every side, and bring them unto their own land;
026	EZE	037	022	And I will make them into one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be to them all for king; and they shall not be any more two nations, nor shall they at any time be divided into two kingdoms any more:
026	EZE	037	023	Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, and with their detestable things, and with all their transgressions; but I will save them out of all their dwelling-places, wherein they have sinned, and I will cleanse them, and they shall be unto me for a people, and I will be to them for a God.
026	EZE	037	024	And my servant David shall be king over them; and one shepherd shall be for them all: and in my ordinances shall they walk, and my statutes shall they observe, and do them.
026	EZE	037	025	And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto my servant, unto Jacob, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, they, and their children, and their children's children for ever: and David my servant shall be prince unto them for ever.
026	EZE	037	026	And I will make with them a covenant of peace, an everlasting covenant shall it be with them: and I will multiply them, and I will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore.
026	EZE	037	027	My dwelling also shall be with them, and I will be unto them for a God; and they shall be unto me as a people.
026	EZE	037	028	And the nations shall know that I am the Lord who sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary will be in the midst of them for evermore.
026	EZE	038	001	And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
026	EZE	038	002	Son of man, direct thy face against Gog of the land of Magog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech and Thubal, and prophesy against him,
026	EZE	038	003	And say, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will be against thee, O Gog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech and Thubal;
026	EZE	038	004	And I will derange thee, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth, and all thy army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed in elegant attire, a great assemblage with bucklers and shields, all of them grasping swords.
026	EZE	038	005	Persia, Cush, and Put [shall be] with them; all of them with shield and helmet;
026	EZE	038	006	Gomer and all of its armies; the house of Thogarmah out of the farthest north, and all its armies; many people shall be with thee.
026	EZE	038	007	Be thou ready, and prepare thyself, thou, and all thy assemblages that are assembled about thee, and be thou a guard unto them.
026	EZE	038	008	After many days shalt thou be ordered forward; in the end of years shalt thou come into the land that is recovering from the sword, and is gathered together out of many people, against the mountains of Israel, which have been ruined for a very long time: [to a people] that are brought forth out of the nations, and that now dwell in safety, all of them.
026	EZE	038	009	Thou wilt ascend and come like a tempest, like a cloud to cover the earth wilt thou be, thou, and all thy armies, and the many people with thee.
026	EZE	038	010	Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, It will also come to pass, at the same time, that things will come into thy mind, and thou wilt entertain an evil device;
026	EZE	038	011	And thou wilt say, I will go up over the land of open towns; I will come against those that are careless, that dwell in safety, all of whom dwell without walls, and have neither bars nor gates,
026	EZE	038	012	To snatch up the spoil, and to take away the prey; to turn thy hand against the ruined places now inhabited, and against the people that are gathered out of the nations, that have gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in the highest part of the land.
026	EZE	038	013	Sheba, and Dedan, and the traders of Tharshish, with all her young lions, will say unto thee, Art thou come to plunder the spoil? hast thou gathered thy company to carry off the prey? to bear away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to plunder a great spoil?
026	EZE	038	014	Therefore, prophesy, son of man, and say unto Gog, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, on the day when my people of Israel dwelleth in safety, shalt thou know [my power].
026	EZE	038	015	And thou wilt come from thy place out of the farthest ends of the north, thou, and many people with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great assemblage, and a mighty army;
026	EZE	038	016	And thou wilt come up against my people of Israel, like a cloud to cover the land; in the latter days will this be, and I will bring thee over my land, in order that the nations may know me, when I am sanctified on thee, before their eyes, O Gog.
026	EZE	038	017	Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Art thou [not] he of whom I have spoken in ancient days through means of my servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in those days [many] years, that I would bring thee against them?
026	EZE	038	018	And it shall come to pass at the same time, on the day of Gog's coming over the land of Israel, saith the Lord Eternal, that my fury shall be kindled in my nose.
026	EZE	038	019	And in my zealousness, in the fire of my wrath, have I spoken, Surely on that day there shall be a great earthquake in the country of Israel;
026	EZE	038	020	And there shall quake at my presence the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the field, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and all the men that are upon the face of the earth, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the cliffs shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.
026	EZE	038	021	And I will call against him throughout all my mountains for the sword, saith the Lord Eternal: every man's sword shall be against his brother.
026	EZE	038	022	And I will hold judgment over him with pestilence and with blood [-shedding]; and an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, and sulfur will I let rain over him and his armies, and over the many people that are with him.
026	EZE	038	023	Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself, and make myself known before the eyes of many nations: and they shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	039	001	But thou, O son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Behold, I will be against thee O Gog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech and Thubal;
026	EZE	039	002	And I will derange thee, and lead thee astray, and will cause thee to come up from the farthest ends of the north; and I will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel;
026	EZE	039	003	And I will strike thy bow out of thy left hand, and thy arrows will I cause to fall out of thy right hand.
026	EZE	039	004	Upon the mountains of Israel shalt thou fall, thou, and all thy armies, and the people that are with thee: unto the ravenous birds, to every thing that hath wings, and to the beasts of the field, do I give thee for food.
026	EZE	039	005	Upon the open field shalt thou fall; for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	039	006	And I will send a fire against Magog, and against those that dwell in the isles in safety: and they shall know that I am the Lord.
026	EZE	039	007	And my holy name will I make known in the midst of my people Israel; and I will not permit my holy name to be profaned any more: and the nations shall know that I am the Lord, Holy in Israel.
026	EZE	039	008	Behold, it cometh, and it taketh place, saith the Lord Eternal; this is the day whereof I have spoken.
026	EZE	039	009	And the inhabitants of the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall burn and make fire for heating of the weapons, and shields and bucklers, of bows and of arrows, and of hand-staves, and of spears; and they shall feed with them the fire for seven years;
026	EZE	039	010	And they shall take no wood out of the field, nor cut down any out of the forests; for with weapons shall they feed the fire: and they shall spoil those that spoiled them, and plunder those that plundered them, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	039	011	And it shall come to pass on that day, that I will give unto Gog a place there for a grave in Israel, the valley where people pass over to the east of the sea; and it shall stop the passengers [from passing]: and they shall bury there Gog and all his multitude, and they shall call it The valley of the multitude of Gog.
026	EZE	039	012	And the house of Israel shall be burying them, in order to cleanse the land, during seven months.
026	EZE	039	013	Yea, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall be to them as a renown on the day that I glorify myself, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	039	014	And men constantly devoted to this shall they set apart to pass through the land, to bury with those that pass through those that remain upon the face of the earth, to cleanse it; at the end of seven months shall they make a search.
026	EZE	039	015	And those that thus travel will pass through the land; and when any one seeth a human bone, then will he set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the valley of the multitude of Gog.
026	EZE	039	016	And also the name of the city shall be Hamonah. Thus shall they cleanse the land.
026	EZE	039	017	And thou, O son of man, thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Say unto the birds, to every thing that hath wings, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves from every side to my sacrifice that I do slaughter for you, as a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh, and drink blood.
026	EZE	039	018	The flesh of the mighty shall ye eat, and the blood of the princes of the earth shall ye drink, —wethers, lambs, and he-goats, bullocks, fatlings of Bashan are they all of them.
026	EZE	039	019	And ye shall eat fat till ye be sated, and ye shall drink blood till ye be drunken, from my sacrifice which I have slaughtered for you.
026	EZE	039	020	And ye shall be sated at my table on horses and chariot-teams, on mighty men, and on all men of war, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	039	021	And I will display my glory among the nations: and all the nations shall see my punishment that I execute, and my hand that I lay on them.
026	EZE	039	022	And the house of Israel shall acknowledge that I am the Lord their God from that day and forward.
026	EZE	039	023	And the nations shall know that for their iniquity did the house of Israel go into exile; because they had trespassed against me, and I had hidden my face from them; and I gave them up therefore into the hand of their oppressors, and they all fell by the sword.
026	EZE	039	024	According to their uncleanness, and according to their transgressions did I deal with them, and hid my face from them.
026	EZE	039	025	Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Now will I bring back again the captivity of Jacob, and I will have mercy upon the whole house of Israel, and will be zealous for my holy name;
026	EZE	039	026	And they shall feel their disgrace, and all their trespass whereby they had trespassed against me, when they dwelt in their land in safety, with none to make them afraid:
026	EZE	039	027	When I bring them back again from the people, and gather them out of the land of their enemies, and sanctify myself on them before the eyes of the many nations.
026	EZE	039	028	And they shall know that I am the Lord their God; because I had exiled them among the nations, but gather them now unto their own land, and leave none of them any more there.
026	EZE	039	029	And I will not hide my face any more from them; for I will have poured out my spirit over the house of Israel, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	040	001	In the five and twentieth year of our exile, in the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city had been smitten, on the selfsame day came the inspiration of the Lord upon me, and brought me thither.
026	EZE	040	002	In the visions of God brought he me unto the land of Israel, and set me down upon a very high mount, on which there was built something like a city on the south.
026	EZE	040	003	And when he had brought me thither, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of copper, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring-rod: and he was standing in the gate.
026	EZE	040	004	And the man spoke unto me, Son of man, behold with thy eyes, and hear with thy ears, and direct thy heart unto all that I am about to show thee; for in order to show it unto thee art thou brought hither: tell all that thou seest to the house of Israel.
026	EZE	040	005	And behold there was a wall on the outside of the house all round about, and in the man's hand was a measuring-rod of six cubits long by the cubit which was a hand's breadth longer than usual; and he measured the breadth of the building, one rod, and the height, one rod.
026	EZE	040	006	Then came he unto the gate which looked in the direction toward the east, and went up its steps, and measured the threshold of the gate, one rod in breadth, and the other threshold one rod in breadth.
026	EZE	040	007	And every cell was one rod long, and one rod broad; and between the cells were five cubits: and the threshold of the gate near by the porch of the gate within was one rod.
026	EZE	040	008	He measured also the porch of the gate within, one rod.
026	EZE	040	009	Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits, and its door-posts, two cubits: and the porch of the gate was inward.
026	EZE	040	010	And the cells of the gate in the eastern direction were three on this side, and three on that side, one measure was for all the three; and there was one measure for the door-posts on this side and on that side.
026	EZE	040	011	And he measured the breadth of the entrance of the gate, ten cubits, [and] the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.
026	EZE	040	012	And there was a space before the cells of one cubit on this side, and one cubit space was there on that side: and every cell was of six cubits on this side, and of six cubits on that side.
026	EZE	040	013	And he measured the gate from the roof of [one] cell to the roof of [another], in breadth five and twenty cubits, one door being against [the other] door.
026	EZE	040	014	And he made door-posts of sixty cubits, and around the door-posts the court and the gate all round about.
026	EZE	040	015	And the height of the gate of the entrance as also the height of the porch of the inner gate was fifty cubits.
026	EZE	040	016	And there were narrow windows in the cells, and by their door-posts within the gate all round about, and likewise in the porches: and windows were all round about inward; and on each door post were palm-shaped [capitals].
026	EZE	040	017	Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, there were chambers, and a pavement made for the court all round about: thirty chambers were upon the pavement.
026	EZE	040	018	And the pavement by the side of the gates was all along the whole length of the gates: this was the lower pavement.
026	EZE	040	019	Then measured he the breadth from the front of the lower gate unto the front of the inner court, without, one hundred cubits, eastward and northward.
026	EZE	040	020	And the gate of the outer court that looked in a northern direction, he measured after its length, and its breadth.
026	EZE	040	021	And its cells were three on this side and three on that side; and its door-posts and its porches were after the measure of the first gate: fifty cubits was its length, and its breadth five and twenty cubits.
026	EZE	040	022	And its windows, and its porches, and their palm-shaped capitals, were after the measure of the gate that looked in an eastern direction: and by seven steps did they go up unto it, and to its porches which were before them.
026	EZE	040	023	And the gates of the inner court were opposite the gates on the north, and on the east: and he measured from gate to gate one hundred cubits.
026	EZE	040	024	After that he led me forth to the south side, and behold there was a gate on the south side: and he measured its door-posts and its porches after these measures.
026	EZE	040	025	And there were windows in it and in its porches all round about, like the other windows: it was fifty cubits in length, and in breadth five and twenty cubits.
026	EZE	040	026	And by seven steps was the ascent to it, and to its porches which were before them; and it had palm-shaped capitals, one on this side, and another on that side, upon its door-posts.
026	EZE	040	027	And there was a gate in the inner court on the south side: and he measured from gate to gate on the south side one hundred cubits.
026	EZE	040	028	And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate; and he measured the south gate after these measures;
026	EZE	040	029	And its cells, and its door-posts, and its porches were after these measures; and there were windows in it and in its porches all round about: it was fifty cubits in length, and in breadth five and twenty cubits.
026	EZE	040	030	And arched passages were all round about, five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad.
026	EZE	040	031	And its porches were toward the outer court; and palm-shaped capitals were upon its door-posts: and its ascent was by eight steps.
026	EZE	040	032	And he brought me into the inner court on the east side; and he measured the gate after these measures;
026	EZE	040	033	And its cells and its door-posts, and its porches, were according to these measures; and there were windows in it and in its porches all round about: its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth five and twenty cubits.
026	EZE	040	034	And its porches were toward the outward court; and palm-shaped capitals were upon its door-posts, on this side, and on that side: and by eight steps was the ascent to it.
026	EZE	040	035	And he brought me to the north gate, and he measured it after these measures;
026	EZE	040	036	Its cells, its door-posts, and its porches; and the windows in it were all round about: its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth five and twenty cubits.
026	EZE	040	037	And its door-posts were toward the outer court; and palm-shaped capitals were upon its door-posts, on this side, and on that side: and by eight steps was the ascent to it.
026	EZE	040	038	And there was a chamber with its door by the door-posts of the gates, where they washed off the burnt-offerings.
026	EZE	040	039	And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slaughter thereon the burnt-offerings and the sin-offerings and the trespass-offerings.
026	EZE	040	040	And at the side without [the porch], as one went up to the entrance of the north gate, were two tables; and on the other side of the porch of the gate were two tables;
026	EZE	040	041	Four tables being on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate, eight tables, whereupon they slaughtered [the sacrifices].
026	EZE	040	042	And there were four tables of hewn stone for the burnt-offerings, of a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high: whereupon they laid the instruments wherewith they slaughtered the burnt-offerings and the sacrifices.
026	EZE	040	043	And hooks, a hand long, were fastened within all round about: and on the tables was placed the flesh of the offerings.
026	EZE	040	044	And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their front was toward the south side: one was at the side of the east gate having the front toward the north side.
026	EZE	040	045	And he spoke unto me, This chamber, the front of which is toward the south, is for the priests who have the charge of the house.
026	EZE	040	046	And the chamber, the front of which is toward the north, is for the priests who have the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok, who come near, from among the sons of Levi, to the Lord to minister unto him.
026	EZE	040	047	So he measured the court, in length one hundred cubits, and in breadth one hundred cubits, foursquare: and the altar [stood] before the house.
026	EZE	040	048	And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each door-post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.
026	EZE	040	049	The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits, together with the steps whereby they went up to it: and there were pillars by the door-posts, one on this side, and another on that side.
026	EZE	041	001	And he brought me to the temple: and he measured the door-posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, [as also] the breadth of the tabernacle.
026	EZE	041	002	And the breadth of the door was ten cubits; and the sides of the door were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured its length, forty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits.
026	EZE	041	003	Then went he inward, and measured the posts of the door, two cubits; and the door was six cubits high; and the breadth of the door, was seven cubits.
026	EZE	041	004	And he measured its length, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, fronting on the temple: and he said unto me, This is the most holy place.
026	EZE	041	005	After this he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side-chamber was four cubits, all round about the house on every side.
026	EZE	041	006	And the side-chambers were one over another, three and thirty times; and they entered into the wall which was on the house for the side-chambers all round about, that they might be fastened on, but they were not fastened on the wall of the house.
026	EZE	041	007	And as one wound upward it became continually wider for the side-chambers; for the row of chambers about the house went more and more upward round about the house; therefore was the breadth of the house greater upward: and so they ascended from the lowest chambers to the highest through the middle ones.
026	EZE	041	008	And I saw the height of the house all round about: the foundations of the side-chambers were a full rod of six cubits under ground.
026	EZE	041	009	The thickness of the wall, which was for the side-chambers without, was five cubits, as also the space which was left open by the row of the side-chambers that were on the house.
026	EZE	041	010	And between the chambers there was a width of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.
026	EZE	041	011	And the doors of the side-chambers were on the open space, one door was in a northern direction, and another door on the south; and the breadth of the place that was left open was five cubits all round about.
026	EZE	041	012	Now the building that was before the main wing on the west side was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and its length, ninety cubits.
026	EZE	041	013	So he measured the house, in length one hundred cubits; and the main wing, and the building, with its walls, in length one hundred cubits;
026	EZE	041	014	Also the breadth in the front of the house, and of the main wing on the east, was one hundred cubits.
026	EZE	041	015	And he measured the length of the building on the front side of the main wing which was behind it, and its corner-pillars on the one side and on the other side, one hundred cubits; and this included the inner temple, and the porches of the court;
026	EZE	041	016	The thresholds, and the narrow windows, and the corner-pillars were round about on their three sides: opposite the threshold there was a wainscoting of wood all round about, and so from the ground up to the windows; and the windows were covered.
026	EZE	041	017	On the part above the door, and as far as the inner house, and the outer [house], was [a wainscoting], and on all the wall round about within and without, by [the same] measure;
026	EZE	041	018	And it was ornamented with cherubim and palm-trees, a palm-tree being between two cherubim; and every cherub had two faces;
026	EZE	041	019	So that a human face was toward the palm-tree on the one side, and a young lion's face toward the palm-tree on the other side: it was so made on all the house round about.
026	EZE	041	020	From the ground to the part above the door were the cherubim and the palm-trees made, and so on the wall of the temple.
026	EZE	041	021	The temple had four-cornered door-posts, and the front of the holy of holies had the [same] appearance as the appearance [of the other].
026	EZE	041	022	The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and its length was two cubits; and its corners, and its top-piece, and its walls, were of wood: and he spoke unto me, This is the table that is before the Lord.
026	EZE	041	023	And the temple and the holy of holies had two doors.
026	EZE	041	024	And the doors had two leaves [apiece], two turning leaves, two [leaves] for the one door, and two leaves for the other.
026	EZE	041	025	And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm-trees, as they were made upon the walls; and [a covering of] thick wooden planks was upon the front of the porch without.
026	EZE	041	026	And there were narrow windows and palm-trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and on the side-chambers of the house, and the [covering of] thick planks.
026	EZE	042	001	And he led me forth into the outer court, on the way to the north side; and he brought me into the [row of] chambers that was opposite the main wing, and which was opposite the building toward the north;
026	EZE	042	002	On the front side the length [of which] was a hundred cubits, [up to] the north door, while the breadth was fifty cubits.
026	EZE	042	003	Opposite the twenty cubits which were for the inner court, and opposite the pavement which was for the outer court, was corner-pillar before corner-pillar in the three stories.
026	EZE	042	004	And before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits in breadth toward the inner house, a way of one cubit [in width]; and their doors were toward the north.
026	EZE	042	005	Now the upper chambers were shorter [for the corner-pillar took away part of the space from them] than the lowest and than the middle chambers of the building.
026	EZE	042	006	For they were in three stories, but had not pillars like the pillars of the courts: therefore was something taken off the lowest and the middle ones [as one ascended] from the ground.
026	EZE	042	007	And the wall that was without alongside the chambers, toward the outer court in front of the chambers, was in its length fifty cubits.
026	EZE	042	008	For the length of the chambers that were in the outer court was fifty cubits; and lo, [the whole space] in front of the temple was one hundred cubits.
026	EZE	042	009	And beneath these chambers was the entrance from the east side, as one goeth into them from the outer court.
026	EZE	042	010	On the breadth of the wall of the court in an eastern direction before the main wing, and before the building, were chambers.
026	EZE	042	011	And the way before them was of like appearance as that for the chambers which were on the north side, of the same length and the same breadth; and all their means of egress, and their arrangement, and their doors were of the like manner.
026	EZE	042	012	And so also were the doors of the chambers that were on the south side, a door being on the head of the way, of the way directly before the wall on the east side, as one entereth into them.
026	EZE	042	013	And he said unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers which are in front of the main wing, —these are the holy chambers, where the priests that approach unto the Lord shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, namely, the meat-offering, and the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering; for the place is holy.
026	EZE	042	014	When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the sanctuary into the outer court; but there shall they lay down their garments wherein they may have ministered; for they are holy: and they shall put on other garments, and shall then approach to [the court] which is for the people.
026	EZE	042	015	Now when he had finished the measurings of the inner house, he led me forth by the way of the gate which looked in an eastern direction, and measured it all round about.
026	EZE	042	016	He measured the east side with the measuring-rod, five hundred rods, with the measuring-rod round about.
026	EZE	042	017	He measured the north aide, five hundred rods, with the measuring-rod round about.
026	EZE	042	018	The south side he measured, five hundred rods, with the measuring-rod.
026	EZE	042	019	He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred rods with the measuring-rod.
026	EZE	042	020	On the four sides did he measure it by the wall that was all round about, five hundred rods in length, and in breadth five hundred, to make a separation between the holy place and the profane.
026	EZE	043	001	Then did he lead me to the gate, even the gate that was turned in an eastern direction.
026	EZE	043	002	And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east; and his voice was like a noise of many waters; and the earth gave light from his glory.
026	EZE	043	003	And it was like the appearance of the vision which I had seen, yea, like the vision that I had seen when I came to destroy the city; and the visions were like the vision that I had seen by the river Kebar: and I fell upon my face.
026	EZE	043	004	And the glory of the Lord came into the house by the way of the gate which was turned in an eastern direction.
026	EZE	043	005	Then did the Spirit take me up, and bring me into the inner court: and, behold, the glory of the Lord filled the house.
026	EZE	043	006	And I heard him speaking unto me out of the house; and a man was standing alongside of me.
026	EZE	043	007	And he said unto me, Son of man, [this] is the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel forever: and the house of Israel shall not defile any more my holy name, neither they, nor their kings, by their lewdness, nor by the carcasses of their kings on their high-places.
026	EZE	043	008	Inasmuch as they placed their threshold by my threshold, and their door-posts close by my door-posts, and the wall being only between me and them, and they defiled my holy name by their abominations which they committed; so that I made an end of them in my anger.
026	EZE	043	009	Now will they have to put away their lewdness, and the carcasses of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever.
026	EZE	043	010	Thou, son of man, tell the house of Israel of the house, that they may be confounded because of their iniquities: and let them measure the outlines.
026	EZE	043	011	And if they be confounded because of all that they have done: then let them know the form of the house, and its arrangements, and its means of egress, and its entrances, and all its forms, and all its statutes, and all its forms, and all its laws, and write them down before their eyes; that they may observe the whole of its form, and all its statutes, and carry them out.
026	EZE	043	012	This is the law for the house, Upon the top of the mount shall its whole limit all round about be most holy: behold, this is the law for the house.
026	EZE	043	013	And these are the measures of the altar in cubits, The cubit is a cubit and a hand-breadth; and the bottom shall be a cubit high, and a cubit broad, and its border on its edge round about shall be a span: and this shall be the outside of the altar.
026	EZE	043	014	And from the bottom upon the ground up to the lower projection shall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser projection up to the greater projection shall be four cubits, and the breadth one cubit.
026	EZE	043	015	And the upper portion of the altar shall be four cubits; and from the upper surface of the altar and upward shall be the four horns.
026	EZE	043	016	And the upper surface of the altar shall be twelve cubits long, by twelve broad, square on its four sides.
026	EZE	043	017	And the projection shall be fourteen cubits in length, by fourteen in breadth on its four sides; and the border round about it shall be half a cubit; and its bottom shall be a cubit round about; and its steps shall look toward the east.
026	EZE	043	018	And he said unto me, Son of man, thus hath said the Lord Eternal, These are the statutes of the altar on the day when it shall be finished, to offer thereon burnt-offerings, and to sprinkle thereon blood.
026	EZE	043	019	And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that are of the seed of Zadok, who approach unto me, saith the Lord Eternal, to minister unto me, a young bullock for a sin-offering.
026	EZE	043	020	And thou shalt take of his blood, and put it on its four horns, and on the four corners of the projection, and upon the border round about; and thou shalt cleanse it and make an atonement for it.
026	EZE	043	021	And thou shalt take the bullock of the sin-offering, and some one shall burn him at an appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary.
026	EZE	043	022	And on the second day shalt thou offer a he-goat without blemish for a sin-offering: and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse it with the bullock.
026	EZE	043	023	When thou hast made an end of cleansing it, shalt thou offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish.
026	EZE	043	024	And thou shalt bring them near before the Lord, and the priests shall throw salt upon them, and they shall offer them up as a burnt-offering unto the Lord.
026	EZE	043	025	Seven days shalt thou prepare a goat for a sin-offering every day; and a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish shall they prepare.
026	EZE	043	026	Seven days shall they atone for the altar and purify it; and they shall consecrate the same.
026	EZE	043	027	And when these days are expired, it shall be, that on the eighth day, and thenceforward, the priests shall prepare upon the altar your burnt-offerings, and your peace-offerings: and I will accept you in favor, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	044	001	And he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary which looked toward the east: and it was locked.
026	EZE	044	002	Then said the Lord unto me, This gate shall remain locked, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the Lord, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore shall it remain locked.
026	EZE	044	003	As for the prince, being the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before the Lord: by the way of the porch of that gate shall he enter, and by the way of the same shall he go out.
026	EZE	044	004	Then brought he me by the way of the north gate before the house; and I looked, and, behold, the glory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord: and I fell upon my face.
026	EZE	044	005	And the Lord said unto me, Son of man, direct thy mind, and see with thy eyes, and hear with thy ears all that I am speaking with thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the Lord, and of all its laws; and direct thy mind to the entrance of the house, with every place of egress of the sanctuary.
026	EZE	044	006	And thou shalt say to the rebellious, to the house of Israel, Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Ye have done enough with all your abominations, O house of Israel!
026	EZE	044	007	In your having brought the sons of the stranger, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to pollute it, even my house, while you were offering my food, the fat and the blood: so that they broke my covenant because of all your abominations.
026	EZE	044	008	And [because] ye have not kept the charge of my holy things; but ye have set [those unworthy ones] as keepers of my charge in my sanctuary at your own pleasure.
026	EZE	044	009	Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, No son of the stranger, uncircumcised in heart, or uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of all the sons of the stranger that are in the midst of the children of Israel.
026	EZE	044	010	But as respecteth the Levites that were gone away far from me, when Israel went astray, who went astray away from me, after their idols, they shall surely bear their iniquity;
026	EZE	044	011	And they shall be in my sanctuary, servants, appointed to watch at the gates of the house, and to be servants for the house: these are they that shall slay the burnt-offerings and the sacrifices for the people, and they shall stand before them to do the service for them.
026	EZE	044	012	Because that they used to serve them before their idols, and have been unto the house of Israel as a stumbling-block of iniquity; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them, saith the Lord Eternal, and they shall bear their iniquity;
026	EZE	044	013	And they shall not come near unto me, to officiate as priests unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, to the most holy things; but they shall bear their shame, yea, for their abominations which they have committed.
026	EZE	044	014	And I will appoint them to be keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein.
026	EZE	044	015	But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, —these are they that shall come near unto me to minister unto me, and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord Eternal:
026	EZE	044	016	These are they that shall enter into my sanctuary, and these shall come near to my table, to minister unto me; and they shall keep my charge.
026	EZE	044	017	And it shall come to pass, that, when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall clothe themselves with linen garments; and there shall no wool come upon them, when they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within the house.
026	EZE	044	018	Linen bonnets shall be upon their heads, and linen breeches shall be upon their loins: they shall not gird themselves with any thing that causeth sweat.
026	EZE	044	019	And when they go forth into the outer court, into the outer court to the people: then shall they put off their garments wherein they have ministered, and they shall lay them down in the holy chambers; and they shall put on other garments, and they shall not mingle among the people with their garments.
026	EZE	044	020	And their heads shall they not shave close, nor suffer their hair to grow long: they shall only crop [the hair of] their heads.
026	EZE	044	021	And wine shall none of the priests drink when they enter into the inner court.
026	EZE	044	022	And a widow, or one that is divorced from her husband shall they not take to themselves as wives; but only virgins of the seed of the house of Israel; but whatever widow it may be, the [common] priests may take.
026	EZE	044	023	And my people shall they teach the difference between the holy and profane, and that between the unclean and the clean shall they make known unto them.
026	EZE	044	024	And in a controversy shall they stand up to judge, according to my ordinances shall they decide it: and my laws and my statutes at all my festivals shall they observe, and my sabbaths shall they sanctify.
026	EZE	044	025	And to a dead person shall they not come to defile themselves; but on father, or on mother, or on son, or on daughter, on brother, or on sister that hath had no husband, may they defile themselves.
026	EZE	044	026	And after he is become clean, —they shall reckon unto him seven days, —
026	EZE	044	027	Then shall he on the day that he cometh into the sanctuary, into the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, offer his sin-offering, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	044	028	And it shall be unto them as an inheritance, I am their inheritance: and any possession shall you not give them in Israel, I am their possession.
026	EZE	044	029	The meat-offering, and the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering—these shall they eat; and every devoted thing in Israel shall belong to them.
026	EZE	044	030	And the first of all kinds of first-fruits of all, and every kind of heave-offering of every thing of all your heave-offerings, shall belong to the priests; and the first of your dough shall you give to the priest, to cause a blessing to rest on thy house.
026	EZE	044	031	Any thing that hath died of itself, or that is torn, whether it be fowl or beast, shall the priests not eat.
026	EZE	045	001	And when ye divide the land by lot for an inheritance, shall ye offer an oblation unto the Lord, as a holy portion of the land, five and twenty thousand rods in length, and in breadth ten thousand. This shall be holy in all its extent round about.
026	EZE	045	002	Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred [rods] by five hundred, square round about; and fifty cubits as an open space for it round about.
026	EZE	045	003	And of this measure shalt thou measure, in length five and twenty thousand, and in breadth ten thousand [rods]: and in it shall be the sanctuary [and] the holy of holies.
026	EZE	045	004	The holy portion of the land shall it be, for the priests the ministers of the sanctuary shall it be, who come near to minister unto the Lord; and it shall be unto them a place for houses, and a holy place for the sanctuary.
026	EZE	045	005	And five and twenty thousand [rods] in length, and ten thousand in breadth, shall also belong unto the Levites, the servants of the house, for themselves, as a possession, with twenty chambers.
026	EZE	045	006	And as the possession of the city shall ye assign five thousand rods broad, and five and twenty thousand long, alongside the holy oblation: unto the whole house of Israel shall it belong.
026	EZE	045	007	And the prince shall have that on the one side and on the other side of the holy oblation, and of the possession of the city, in front of the holy oblation, and in front of the possession of the city, on the west side westward, and on the east side eastward; and in length alongside one of the portions, both on the west border and on the east border.
026	EZE	045	008	As landed property shall it be his possession in Israel: and my princes shall no more wrong my people; but the land shall they give to the house of Israel according to their tribes.
026	EZE	045	009	Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, Ye have done enough wrong, O princes of Israel: remove violence and robbery, and execute justice and righteousness; take away your exactions from my people, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	045	010	Just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath shall ye have.
026	EZE	045	011	The ephah and the bath shall contain the same quantity, that the bath may contain the tenth part of a chomer, and the ephah the tenth part of a chomer: after the chomer shall the measure of contents be.
026	EZE	045	012	And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs: [in pieces of] twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh.
026	EZE	045	013	This is the heave-offering that ye shall offer; The sixth part of an ephah of a chomer of wheat; and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah of a chomer of barley;
026	EZE	045	014	And the fixed portion of oil shall be after the bath of oil, the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, ten baths reckoned to the chomer; for ten baths are a chomer;
026	EZE	045	015	And one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the fat pastures of Israel, for meat-offerings, and for burnt-offerings, and for peace-offerings, to make an atonement for them, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	045	016	All the people of the land shall be held bound for this heave-offering for the prince in Israel.
026	EZE	045	017	And upon the prince shall be the duty to furnish the burnt-offerings, the meat-offerings, and the drink-offerings, on the feasts, and on the new-moon days, and on the sabbaths, on all the festive seasons of the house of Israel: he himself shall prepare the sin-offering, and the meat-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings, to make an atonement in behalf of the house of Israel.
026	EZE	045	018	Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, In the first month, on the first of the month, shalt thou take a young bullock without blemish, and make an expiation for the sanctuary.
026	EZE	045	019	And the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin-offering, and put it upon the door-post of the house, and upon the four corners of the projection of the altar, and upon the door-post of the gate of the inner court.
026	EZE	045	020	And so shalt thou do on the seventh day of the month for every one that erreth, and for him that hath sinned unawares; so shall ye atone for the house.
026	EZE	045	021	In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, shall ye have the passover: a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten.
026	EZE	045	022	And the prince shall prepare on that day in behalf of himself and in behalf of all the people of the land a bullock for a sin-offering.
026	EZE	045	023	And on the seven days of the feast shall he prepare a burnt-offering to the Lord, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish on every day of the seven days; and for a sin-offering a he-goat on every day.
026	EZE	045	024	And as a meat-offering an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram shall he prepare, and a hin of oil for each ephah.
026	EZE	045	025	In the seventh month, on the fifteenth day of the month, on the feast, shall he prepare the like during the seven days, both the sin-offering, as also the burnt-offering, and the meat-offering, and the oil.
026	EZE	046	001	Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, The gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east shall remain locked the six working days; but on the sabbath day shall it be opened, and on the new-moon day shall it be opened.
026	EZE	046	002	And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate, from without, and shall stand by the door-post of the gate, and the priests shall prepare his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings, and he shall bow himself down at the threshold of the gate, and he shall then go forth; but the gate shall not be locked until the evening.
026	EZE	046	003	And the people of the land shall bow themselves down at the door of this same gate on the sabbaths and on the new-moons before the Lord.
026	EZE	046	004	And the burnt-offering which the prince is to offer unto the Lord, shall be on the sabbath-day six sheep without blemish, and a ram without blemish;
026	EZE	046	005	And as a meat-offering an ephah for the ram, and for the sheep a meat-offering as his hand may be able to give, and a hin of oil for every ephah.
026	EZE	046	006	And on the day of the new moon, a young bullock without blemish, and six sheep and a ram; without blemish shall they be.
026	EZE	046	007	And an ephah for the bullock, and an ephah for the ram, shall he prepare as a meat-offering, and for the sheep according as his means may reach, and a hin of oil for every ephah.
026	EZE	046	008	And when the prince doth enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of the gate, and by the same way shall he go forth.
026	EZE	046	009	But when the people of the land come before the Lord on the appointed feasts, he that entereth in by the way of the north gate to bow himself down shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go out by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in; but by that opposite to him shall he go out.
026	EZE	046	010	And as for the prince—in the midst of them, when they go in, shall he go in; and when they go out, shall they go out [together].
026	EZE	046	011	And on the feasts and on the appointed festivals shall the meat-offering be an ephah for each bullock, and an ephah for each ram, and for the sheep as his hand may be able to give, and a hin of oil for every ephah.
026	EZE	046	012	And when the prince doth prepare as a voluntary gift a burnt-offering, or a peace-offering, as a voluntary gift unto the Lord: then shall be opened for him the gate that looketh toward the east, and he shall prepare his burnt-offering and his peace-offering, as he usually doth on the sabbath-day; and he shall go out, and the gate shall be locked after his going out.
026	EZE	046	013	And a sheep of the first year without blemish shalt thou prepare as a burnt-offering every day unto the Lord: morning by morning shalt thou prepare it.
026	EZE	046	014	And as a meat-offering shalt thou prepare with it, morning by morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third of a hin of oil, to mingle with the fine flour—a meat-offering unto the Lord, as ordinances for ever continually.
026	EZE	046	015	Thus shall they prepare the sheep, and the meat-offering, and the oil, morning by morning, as a continual burnt-offering.
026	EZE	046	016	Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, If the prince make gift unto any one of his sons, it is his inheritance, it shall belong to his sons: it shall be their possession as their inheritance.
026	EZE	046	017	But if he make a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants: then shall it remain his to the year of freedom, when it shall return to the prince; but his inheritance shall only remain for his sons.
026	EZE	046	018	But the prince shall not take any thing from the inheritance of the people, to wrong them out of their possession: out of his own possession can he give an inheritance to his sons; in order that not one of my people be deprived of his possession.
026	EZE	046	019	And then he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers for the priests, which looked toward the north: and, behold, there was a place by the back wall on the west side.
026	EZE	046	020	And he said unto me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass-offering and the sin-offering, where [also] they shall bake the meat-offering; so as not to carry the same out into the outer court, to mingle with the people.
026	EZE	046	021	Then did he lead me forth into the outer court, and caused me to pass along the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court there was a court.
026	EZE	046	022	In the four corners of the court there were uncovered courts of forty cubits in length and thirty in breadth: there was one measure for all these four in the corners.
026	EZE	046	023	And there was a shelf of masonry round about in them, round about all these four, and it was furnished with hearths for boiling under the shelves round about.
026	EZE	046	024	Then said he unto me, These are the places of those that boil, where the servants of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people.
026	EZE	047	001	And he brought me back again unto the door of the house: and, behold, water was issuing out from under the threshold of the house eastward; for the front of the house stood toward the east; and the water came down from under [the threshold], from the right side of the house, to the south of the altar.
026	EZE	047	002	Then did he bring me out by the way of the gate northwards and led me about the way without unto the outer gate by the way that looked eastward: and, behold, the water was running on the right side.
026	EZE	047	003	When the man went forth eastward, having the measuring-line in his hand, he measured a thousand cubits, and he led me through the water, the water reaching to the ankles.
026	EZE	047	004	Again he measured a thousand [cubits], and led me through the water, the water reaching to the knees. Again he measured a thousand [cubits], and led me through, the water reaching to the loins.
026	EZE	047	005	And he measured again a thousand [cubits], it being a stream that I could not wade through; for the water was increased, being water fit to swim in, a stream that could not be waded through.
026	EZE	047	006	And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen this: Then did he lead me, and caused me to return to the bank of the stream.
026	EZE	047	007	Now when I returned, behold, there were at the banks of the stream very many trees, on the one side and on the other.
026	EZE	047	008	Then said he unto me, These waters issue out toward the eastern district, and go down into the plain, and fall into the sea, [the waters] being carried forth into the sea, so that the waters shall be healed.
026	EZE	047	009	And it shall come to pass, that every thing that liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the double-stream shall come, shall live: and the fish shall be [therein] in great abundance; for when this water shall have come thither, [the waters of the sea] shall be healed, and every thing shall live whither the stream cometh.
026	EZE	047	010	And it shall come to pass, that the fishers shall stand by it; from 'En-gedi even unto 'En-'eglayim, there shall be places for the spreading out of nets: after their various kinds shall the fish thereof be, like the fish of the great sea, exceedingly many.
026	EZE	047	011	But its swamps and its lagoons shall not be healed, for [the production of] salt are they destined.
026	EZE	047	012	And by the stream upon its banks, on this side and on that side, shall grow up all kinds of trees for food, the leaves of which shall not fade, and the fruit of which shall not come to an end, every month shall they bring forth new ripe fruit; because its water is that which issueth out of the sanctuary; and their fruit shall serve for food, and their leaves for remedies.
026	EZE	047	013	Thus hath said the Lord Eternal, This shall be the boundary, whereby ye shall divide out the land unto the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph shall have two portions.
026	EZE	047	014	And ye shall inherit it, every one like the other, [the land] concerning which I lifted up my hand to give it unto your fathers: and this land shall fall unto you for an inheritance.
026	EZE	047	015	And this shall be the boundary of the land: On the north side, from the great sea, the road to Chethlon, as far as to Zedad;
026	EZE	047	016	Chamath, Berothah, Sibrayim, which is between the boundary of Damascus and the boundary of Chamath; Chazar-hattichon, which is by the boundary of Chavran.
026	EZE	047	017	And the boundary shall be from the sea to Chazar-'enon, the boundary of Damascus, and the northern part on the north, and the boundary of Chamath. And this is the north side.
026	EZE	047	018	And the east side shall ye measure between Chavran and Damascus [on the one side], and between Gil'ad and the land of Israel [on the other side] by the Jordan, from the [north] boundary unto the east sea. And this is the east side.
026	EZE	047	019	And the south side; on the south, from Thamar even to the waters of contention at Kadesh, toward the brook [flowing] into the Great Sea. And this is the south side on the south.
026	EZE	047	020	And the west side shall be the great sea from the [southern] boundary, as far as straight up to Chamath. This is the west side.
026	EZE	047	021	And ye shall divide this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel.
026	EZE	047	022	And it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance among yourselves, and to the strangers that sojourn in the midst of you, who shall have begotten children in the midst of you; and they shall be unto you as the native born among the children of Israel: with you shall they obtain an inheritance in the midst of the tribes of Israel.
026	EZE	047	023	And it shall come to pass that in whatever tribe the stranger sojourneth, there shall ye give him his inheritance, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	048	001	Now these are the names of the tribes: At the edge, on the north side, along the road on the way to Chethlon, as far as Chamath, Chazar-'enan, the boundary of Damascus northward, alongside of Chamath, there shall be from the east side to the west for Dan one portion.
026	EZE	048	002	And by the boundary of Dan, from the east side unto the west side, for Asher one portion.
026	EZE	048	003	And by the boundary of Asher, from the east side even unto the west side, for Naphtali one portion.
026	EZE	048	004	And by the boundary of Naphtali, from the east side unto the west side, for Menasseh one portion.
026	EZE	048	005	And by the boundary of Menasseh, from the east side unto the west side, for Ephraim one portion.
026	EZE	048	006	And by the boundary of Ephraim, from the east side even unto the west side, for Reuben one portion.
026	EZE	048	007	And by the boundary of Reuben, from the east side unto the west side, for Judah one portion.
026	EZE	048	008	And by the boundary of Judah, from the east side unto the west side, shall be the oblation which ye shall set aside of five and twenty thousand rods in breadth, and in length as one of the other parts, from the east side unto the west side: and the sanctuary shall be in the midst of it.
026	EZE	048	009	The oblation that ye shall set aside unto the Lord shall be in length five and twenty thousand [rods], and in breadth ten thousand.
026	EZE	048	010	And to these shall belong the holy oblation, —namely to the priests, toward the north, five and twenty thousand rods [in length], and on the west ten thousand in breadth, and on the east ten thousand in breadth, and on the south five and twenty thousand in length: and the sanctuary of the Lord shall be in the midst of it.
026	EZE	048	011	Unto the priests, that are sanctified, of the sons of Zadok, who have kept my charge, who went not astray when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray.
026	EZE	048	012	To them shall thus belong the portion set aside of the oblation of the land as a most holy thing by the boundary of the Levites.
026	EZE	048	013	And the Levites shall have alongside the boundary of the priests five and twenty thousand rods in length, and in breadth ten thousand; the whole in length five and twenty thousand, and in breadth ten thousand.
026	EZE	048	014	But they shall not sell aught thereof, or exchange, or alienate this first portion of the land; for it is holy unto the Lord.
026	EZE	048	015	And the five thousand rods, that are left in the breadth, with a length of five and twenty thousand, shall be an unconsecrated land for the city, for dwelling, and for an open space: and the city shall be in the midst thereof.
026	EZE	048	016	And these shall be its measures: The north side four thousand and five hundred [rods], and the south side four thousand and five hundred, and on the east side four thousand and five hundred, and the west side four thousand and five hundred.
026	EZE	048	017	And the open space of the city shall be toward the north two hundred and fifty [rods], and toward the south two hundred and fifty, and toward the east two hundred and fifty, and toward the west two hundred and fifty.
026	EZE	048	018	And the produce of the residue in length alongside the holy oblation ten thousand rods eastward, and ten thousand westward, that which is alongside the holy oblation, shall be for food unto the laborers of the city.
026	EZE	048	019	And the laborers of the city, men taken out of all the tribes of Israel, shall till it.
026	EZE	048	020	All the oblation, five and twenty thousand [rods] by five and twenty thousand square, shall ye set apart as the holy oblation, with the possession of the city.
026	EZE	048	021	And the residue shall belong to the prince, on the one side and on the other of the holy oblation, and of the possession of the city, alongside of the five and twenty thousand of the oblation toward the eastern boundary, and westward alongside the five and twenty thousand toward the western boundary, alongside the portions [of the tribes]; for the prince [shall it be]: and so shall be the holy oblation; and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the midst thereof.
026	EZE	048	022	And both the possession of the Levites, and the possession of the city, shall be in the midst of that which belongeth to the prince: between the boundary of Judah and the boundary of Benjamin, shall be for the prince.
026	EZE	048	023	As for the rest of the tribes, from the east side unto the west side, shall be for Benjamin one portion.
026	EZE	048	024	And by the boundary of Benjamin, from the east side unto the west side, for Simeon one portion.
026	EZE	048	025	And by the boundary of Simeon, from the east side unto the west side, for Issachar one portion.
026	EZE	048	026	And by the boundary of Issachar, from the east side unto the west side, for Zebulun one portion.
026	EZE	048	027	And by the boundary of Zebulun, from the east side unto the west side, for Gad one portion.
026	EZE	048	028	And by the boundary of Gad, on the southern side toward the south, shall be the boundary from Thamar unto the waters of contention of Kadesh, unto the brook by the Great Sea.
026	EZE	048	029	This is the land which ye shall divide by lot for an inheritance to the tribes of Israel, and these are their allotted divisions, saith the Lord Eternal.
026	EZE	048	030	And these are the outlines of the city: On the north side, five hundred and four thousand rods, by the measure.
026	EZE	048	031	And of the gates of the city, being after the names of the tribes of Israel, shall be three gates on the north: the gate of Reuben one, the gate of Judah one, the gate of Levi one.
026	EZE	048	032	And on the east side, five hundred and four thousand rods, with three gates: namely, the gate of Joseph one, the gate of Benjamin one, the gate of Dan one.
026	EZE	048	033	And the south side, five hundred and four thousand rode by the measure, with three gates: the gate of Simeon one, the gate of Issachar one, the gate of Zebulun one.
026	EZE	048	034	The west side, five hundred and four thousand rods, with their three gates: the gate of Gad one, the gate of Asher one, the gate of Naphtali one.
026	EZE	048	035	All around it shall be eighteen thousand rods: and the name of the city shall be from that day “The Lord is there.”

# BOOK	027	DAN	Daniel	Daniel
027	DAN	001	001	In the third year of the reign of Jehoyakim the king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.
027	DAN	001	002	And the Lord gave up into his hand Yehoyakim the king of Judah, with part of the vessels of the house of God: and he brought them into the land of Shin'ar into the house of his god, namely, he brought the vessels into the treasure-house of his god.
027	DAN	001	003	And the king said unto Ashpenas, the chief of his eunuchs, that he should bring out of the children of Israel, and of the royal seed, and of the nobles,
027	DAN	001	004	[Certain] lads in whom there should be no kind of blemish, but who should be handsome in appearance, and intelligent in all wisdom, and acquainted with knowledge, and understanding science, and such as should have the ability to serve in the king's palace, and that these should be taught the learning and the language of the Chaldeans.
027	DAN	001	005	And the king ordered for them a daily provision for its day of the king's food, and of the wine which he drank, and to educate them three years, so that at the end thereof they should serve before the king.
027	DAN	001	006	Now there were among these of the children of Judah, Daniel, Chananyah, Mishael, and 'Azaryah.
027	DAN	001	007	And the chief of the eunuchs assigned them names; and he assigned to Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Chananyah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to 'Azaryah, of 'Abed-nego.
027	DAN	001	008	But Daniel resolved in his heart that he would not defile himself with the food of the king, nor with the wine which he drank: and therefore he requested of the chief of the eunuchs that he might not need to defile himself.
027	DAN	001	009	And God gave Daniel kindness and mercy before the chief of the eunuchs.
027	DAN	001	010	And the chief of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath ordered your food and your drink; for why should he see your face sadder looking than that of the lads who are of your age? and ye would thus endanger my head with the king.
027	DAN	001	011	Then said Daniel to the steward whom the chief of the eunuchs had given charge over Daniel, Chananyah, Mishael, and 'Azaryah,
027	DAN	001	012	Prove, I beseech thee, thy servants, ten days; and let them give us vegetables to eat, and water to drink;
027	DAN	001	013	And then let our countenances be looked at before thee, and the countenance of the lads that eat the food of the king: and as thou mayest see [fitting], so deal with thy servants.
027	DAN	001	014	And he hearkened unto them in this matter, and proved them ten days.
027	DAN	001	015	And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared better and fuller in flesh than [that of] all the lads who ate the food of the king.
027	DAN	001	016	And the steward took away their [apportioned] food, and the wine that they were to drink, and gave them vegetables.
027	DAN	001	017	But as regardeth all these four lads, God gave them knowledge and intelligence in all learning and wisdom; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.
027	DAN	001	018	And at the end of the days [after] which the king had said that they should be presented, the chief of the eunuchs presented them before Nebuchadnezzar.
027	DAN	001	019	And the king spoke with them; and there was not found among them all any one like Daniel, Chananyah, Mishael, and 'Azaryah: and so they served before the king.
027	DAN	001	020	And in every matter of wise understanding, which the king required of them, he found them ten times superior above all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his kingdom.
027	DAN	001	021	And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.
027	DAN	002	001	And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, whereat his spirit was troubled, and his sleep that was upon him was gone.
027	DAN	002	002	Then said the king to call the magicians, and the astrologers and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to solve for the king his dreams: and they came and placed themselves before the king.
027	DAN	002	003	And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream.
027	DAN	002	004	Then spoke the Chaldeans to the king in Aramic, O king, live for ever: recite the dream to thy servants, and we will tell the interpretation.
027	DAN	002	005	The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The decree is firmly resolved on by me: If ye do not make known unto me the dream with its interpretation, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be changed into a dunghill.
027	DAN	002	006	But if ye tell the dream and its interpretation, then shall ye receive gifts and rewards and great honor from me. Therefore tell me the dream and its interpretation.
027	DAN	002	007	They answered the second time and said, Let the king recite the dream to his servants, and we will tell its interpretation.
027	DAN	002	008	The king answered and said, I know of a certainty that ye wish to gain time, because ye see the decree is firmly resolved on by me:
027	DAN	002	009	That if ye do not make known unto me the dream, there is but one sentence for you; for ye have prepared lying and deceptive words to speak before me, till the time be changed. Therefore relate to me the dream, and I shall know that ye can tell me its interpretation.
027	DAN	002	010	The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the habitable earth that can tell the king's matter: wherefore no mighty and powerful king ever hath asked such a thing of any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.
027	DAN	002	011	And the matter which the king requireth is difficult, and there is no other that can tell it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.
027	DAN	002	012	For all this cause the king became angry, and very furious; and he commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.
027	DAN	002	013	And the law went forth and [some of] the wise men were slain: and they sought Daniel and his companions to slay them.
027	DAN	002	014	Then made Daniel representations with intelligence and prudence to Aryoch the captain of the king's guard, who was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon.
027	DAN	002	015	He commenced and said to Aryoch the king's commander, Wherefore is the law so hasty from the king? Then made Aryoch the matter known to Daniel.
027	DAN	002	016	But Daniel went in, and requested of the king that he would give him time, that he might tell the interpretation to the king.
027	DAN	002	017	Then went Daniel to his house, and made the matter known to Chananyah, Mishael, and 'Azaryah, his companions.
027	DAN	002	018	In order that they might pray for mercy of the God of heaven concerning this secret: so that Daniel and his companions might not be destroyed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.
027	DAN	002	019	Thereupon was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a vision of the night. Then did Daniel bless the God of heaven.
027	DAN	002	020	Daniel commenced and said, May the name of God be blessed from eternity and to all eternity; for wisdom and might are his;
027	DAN	002	021	And he changeth times and seasons; he removeth kings, and raiseth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to those that possess understanding.
027	DAN	002	022	He it is that revealeth what is deep and secret; he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.
027	DAN	002	023	To thee, O God of my father, do I give thanks, and I praise thee, who hast given me wisdom and might, and because thou hast made known unto me what we prayed for of thee; for thou hast made known unto us the king's matter.
027	DAN	002	024	Therefore did Daniel go in unto Aryoch, whom the king had ordered to destroy the wise men of Babylon, He went and said thus unto him, the wise men of Babylon must thou not destroy: bring me before the king, and I will tell unto the king the interpretation.
027	DAN	002	025	Then did Aryoch bring Daniel before the king in haste, and thus he said unto him, Here have I found a man out of the children of the exiles of Judah, who will make known unto the king the interpretation.
027	DAN	002	026	The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and its interpretation?
027	DAN	002	027	Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded no wise men, astrologers, magicians, or soothsayers, can tell unto the king;
027	DAN	002	028	But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and he hath made known to king Nebuchadnezzar what is to be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy couch, were these.
027	DAN	002	029	As for thee, O king, thy thoughts, when thou wast on thy couch, rose [within thee] concerning what is to come to pass hereafter; and the Revealer of secrets hath made known to thee what is to come to pass.
027	DAN	002	030	But as for me, this secret hath not been revealed to me because of any wisdom that is in me more than in all other living; but for the sake that men might make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest understand the thoughts of thy heart.
027	DAN	002	031	Thou, O king, sawest, and behold there was a large image; this image was mighty, and its brightness was excellent; it stood opposite to thee; and its form was fear-inspiring.
027	DAN	002	032	As regardeth this image, its head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms were of silver, its belly and its thighs of copper,
027	DAN	002	033	Its legs of iron, its feet part of them of iron and part of them of clay.
027	DAN	002	034	Thou didst look on till the moment that a stone tore itself loose, not through [human] hands, and it struck the image upon its feet that were of iron and clay, and ground them to pieces.
027	DAN	002	035	Then were the iron, the clay, the copper, the silver, and the gold ground up together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away, that no trace was found of them; and the stone that had stricken the image became a mighty mountain, and filled the whole earth.
027	DAN	002	036	This is the dream; and its interpretation will we relate before the king.
027	DAN	002	037	Thou, O king, art a king of kings, to whom the God of heaven hath given kingdom, power, and strength, and honor:
027	DAN	002	038	And wheresoever the children of men dwell, hath he given the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven into thy hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art the head of gold.
027	DAN	002	039	And after thee there will arise another kingdom inferior to thee; and another third kingdom of copper, which will bear rule over all the earth.
027	DAN	002	040	And the fourth kingdom will be as strong as iron; forasmuch as iron grindeth up and beateth down all things, and as iron that breaketh [every thing], will it grind up and break all these.
027	DAN	002	041	And that thou sawest the feet and toes, and part of them of potter's clay, and part of them of iron, [signifieth] that it will be a divided kingdom, although there will be in it of the strength of the iron; forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mingled with miry clay.
027	DAN	002	042	And as the toes of the feet were part of them of iron, and part of them of clay: so will the kingdom be partly strong and partly brittle.
027	DAN	002	043	And whereas thou sawest iron mingled with miry clay: so will they mingle themselves among the seed of men; but they will not cleave firmly one to another, even as iron cannot be mingled with clay.
027	DAN	002	044	But in the days of these kings will the God of heaven set up a kingdom: which shall to eternity not be destroyed, and its rule shall not be transferred to any other people; [but] it will grind up and make an end of all these kingdoms, while it will itself endure for ever.
027	DAN	002	045	Whereas thou sawest that out of the mountain a stone tore itself loose, not through [human] hands, and that it ground up the iron, the copper, the clay, the silver, and the gold: the great God hath made known to the king what is to come to pass after this. And the dream is reliable, and its interpretation certain.
027	DAN	002	046	Then did king Nebuchadnezzar fall upon his face, and he bowed down to Daniel, and ordered that they should offer an oblation and sweet odors unto him.
027	DAN	002	047	The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of kings, and the revealer of secrets; because thou hast been able to reveal this secret.
027	DAN	002	048	Then did the king elevate Daniel, and gave him many great presents, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the superintendents over all the wise men of Babylon.
027	DAN	002	049	Then requested Daniel of the king, that he might appoint Shadrach, Meshach, and 'Abed-nego, over the public service of the province of Babylon; but Daniel remained in the gate of the king.
027	DAN	003	001	King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold, the height of which was sixty cubits, and the breadth of which was six cubits: he set it up in the valley of Dura, in the province of Babylon.
027	DAN	003	002	And king Nebuchadnezzar sent to assemble [his] lieutenants, the superintendents, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, those learned in the law, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which king Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
027	DAN	003	003	Thereupon were assembled the lieutenants, the superintendents, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, those learned in the law, and all the rulers of the provinces unto the dedication of the image that king Nebuchadnezzar had set up; and they stood opposite to the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
027	DAN	003	004	Then a herald called out with a loud voice, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,
027	DAN	003	005	That at the time when ye do hear the sound of the cornet, flute, guitar, harp, psaltery, bagpipe, and all kinds of music, ye shall fall down and bow yourselves to the golden image which king Nebuchadnezzar hath set up:
027	DAN	003	006	And whoso doth not fall down and bow himself shall in the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
027	DAN	003	007	Therefore at the same time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, guitar, harp, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the people, the nations, and the languages fell down bowing themselves to the golden image which king Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
027	DAN	003	008	Therefore at the same time certain Chaldean men came near, and accused the Jews treacherously.
027	DAN	003	009	They commenced and said to king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever.
027	DAN	003	010	Thou, O king, hadst made a decree, that every man that should hear the sound of the cornet, flute, guitar, harp, psaltery, and bagpipe, and all kinds of music, should fall down and bow himself to the golden image;
027	DAN	003	011	And that whoso should not fall down and bow himself should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
027	DAN	003	012	There are certain Jewish men whom thou hast appointed over the public service of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and 'Abed-nego: these men, O king, have not paid any regard to thee; thy god they do not worship, and to the golden image which thou hast set up they do not bow themselves.
027	DAN	003	013	Then ordered Nebuchadnezzar in rage and fury to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and 'Abed-nego. Then were these men brought before the king.
027	DAN	003	014	Nebuchadnezzar commenced and said unto them, Is it out of disrespect, O Shadrach, Meshach, and 'Abed-nego? My god ye do not worship, and to the golden image which I have set up ye do not bow yourselves?
027	DAN	003	015	Now then if ye be ready at the time when ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, guitar, psaltery, and bagpipe, and all kinds of music, to fall down and bow yourselves to the image which I have made, [well]; but if ye bow yourselves not, ye shall be cast in the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace: and who is the God that can deliver you out of my hand?
027	DAN	003	016	Then answered Shadrach, Meshach, and 'Abed-nego, and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer thee a word in this matter.
027	DAN	003	017	Behold, there is our God whom we worship, he is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace: and out of thy hand, O king, will he deliver us.
027	DAN	003	018	But if not, then be it known unto thee, O king, that thy god will we not worship, and to the golden image which; thou hast set up will we not bow ourselves.
027	DAN	003	019	Then was Nebuchadnezzar filled with fury, and the form of his countenance was changed because of Shadrach, Meshach, and 'Abed-nego; [and] he commenced and ordered that they should heat the furnace thoroughly seven times more than it was wont to be heated.
027	DAN	003	020	And he ordered the mightiest men in strength that were in his army, to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and 'Abed-nego, [and] to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.
027	DAN	003	021	Then were these men bound in their mantles, their under-garments, and their turbans, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
027	DAN	003	022	Now, because the king's command was so urgent, and the furnace exceedingly heated, the flame of the fire slew those men that carried up Shadrach, Meshach, and 'Abed-nego.
027	DAN	003	023	And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and 'Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
027	DAN	003	024	Then was king Nebuchadnezzar astonished, and he rose up in haste, [and] commenced, and said unto his counsellors, Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, Certainly, O king.
027	DAN	003	025	He answered and said, Lo, I see four men unbound, walking in the midst of the fire, and there is no injury on them; and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods.
027	DAN	003	026	Then came Nebuchadnezzar near to the door of the burning fiery furnace, commenced, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and 'Abed-nego, ye servants of the most high God, step forth, and come hither. Then stepped Shadrach, Meshach, and 'Abed-nego forth out of the midst of the fire.
027	DAN	003	027	And the lieutenants, superintendents, and governors, and the king's counsellors, being assembled together, saw these men, over whose bodies the fire had had no power, and the hair of whose head was not singed, whose mantles were not changed, and on whom there was not come the smell of fire.
027	DAN	003	028	Then commenced Nebuchadnezzar, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and 'Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that had trusted in him, and had transgressed the king's word, and yielded up their bodies, that they might not worship no bow themselves to any god, except their own God.
027	DAN	003	029	Therefore do I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, that may speak any thing disrespectful against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and 'Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be changed into a dunghill; because there is no other God that can deliver like this one.
027	DAN	003	030	Then did the king promote Shadrach, Meshach, and 'Abed-nego, in the province of Babylon.
027	DAN	004	001	Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell on all the earth, May your welfare increase.
027	DAN	004	002	The signs and wonders which the most high God hath wrought toward me I find it for good to make known.
027	DAN	004	003	His signs—how great are they! and his wonders— how mighty are they! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his rule is over every generation.
027	DAN	004	004	Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace.
027	DAN	004	005	I saw a dream which terrified me; and the thoughts upon my couch and the visions of my head troubled me.
027	DAN	004	006	Therefore made I a decree to bring before me all the wise men of Babylon, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream.
027	DAN	004	007	Then came up the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers; and the dream did I recite before them; but its interpretation did they not make known unto me.
027	DAN	004	008	But at the last came up before me Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, after the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and the dream did I recite before him, [saying,]
027	DAN	004	009	O Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, of whom I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and that no secret is concealed from thee, tell me the visions of my dream which I have seen, with its interpretation.
027	DAN	004	010	And the visions of my head on my couch were, [that] I saw, and behold, there was a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height was great.
027	DAN	004	011	The tree grew, and was strong, and its height reached unto heaven, and it was visible to the end of all the earth.
027	DAN	004	012	Its foliage was splendid, and its fruit large, and on it was food for all: under it sought the beasts of the field for shade, and in its boughs dwelt the fowls of heaven, and from it was fed all flesh.
027	DAN	004	013	I saw in the visions of my head on my couch, and, behold, a watcher who was also a holy one came down from heaven.
027	DAN	004	014	He called with might, and thus he said, Hew down the trees and lop off its branches, strip off its leaves, and scatter its fruit; let the beasts flee away from under it, and the fowls from among its branches:
027	DAN	004	015	Nevertheless leave the body of its roots in the earth, but [bound] with fetters of iron and copper, among the grass of the field; and let it be made wet with the dew of heaven, and let its portion be with the beasts on the herbage of the earth;
027	DAN	004	016	Let his heart be changed not to be human, and let a beast's heart be given unto him; and let seven times elapse over him.
027	DAN	004	017	Through the resolve of the watchers is this decree, and by the order of the holy ones is this decision: to the intent that the living may know that the Most High ruleth over the kingdom of men, and that he can give it to whomsoever he pleaseth, and can set up over it the lowest of men.
027	DAN	004	018	This dream have I, king Nebuchadnezzar, seen; but thou, O Belteshazzar, relate its interpretation, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation; but thou art able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.
027	DAN	004	019	Then was Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, astounded for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king then commenced, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or its interpretation, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, O that the dream might be for those that hate thee, and its interpretation for thy enemies.
027	DAN	004	020	The tree that thou hast seen, which grew, and was strong, the height of which reached unto the heaven, and which was visible to all the earth;
027	DAN	004	021	The foliage of which was splendid, and the fruit of which was large, and on which was food for all; under which dwelt the beasts of the field, and in the boughs of which nestled the fowls of the heaven: —
027	DAN	004	022	It is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong; and thy greatness is grown apace, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion is to the end of the earth.
027	DAN	004	023	And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven, who said, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the body of its roots in the earth, but [bound] in fetters of iron and copper, among the grass of the field; and let it be made wet with the dew of heaven, and let its portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times elapse over it: —
027	DAN	004	024	This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the resolve of the Most High, which will come over my lord the king:
027	DAN	004	025	They will drive thee away from men, and with the beasts of the field is thy dwelling to be, and they will suffer thee to eat herbs like oxen, and they will suffer thee to be made wet with the dew of heaven, and seven times will elapse over thee; until that thou wilt know that the Most High ruleth over the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he pleaseth.
027	DAN	004	026	And whereas they ordered to leave the body of the roots of the tree: thy kingdom will remain unto thee, as soon as thou wilt know that the Heavens do rule.
027	DAN	004	027	Therefore, O king, let my counsel be agreeable unto thee, and atone for thy sins by righteousness, and for thy iniquities by showing kindness to the poor: perhaps thy prosperity may [thereby] endure long.
027	DAN	004	028	All this came over king Nebuchadnezzar.
027	DAN	004	029	At the end of twelve months he was walking upon the royal palace at Babylon.
027	DAN	004	030	The king commenced, and said, Is not this Babylon the great, that I myself have built for a royal residence by the might of my power, and for the honor of my majesty?
027	DAN	004	031	The word was still in the king's mouth, when there fell a voice from heaven, [saying,] To thee it is said, O king Nebuchadnezzar, The kingdom departeth from thee.
027	DAN	004	032	And from men will they drive thee away, and with the beasts of the field shall thy dwelling be; herbs like oxen will they suffer thee to eat, and seven times shall elapse over thee: until thou wilt know that the Most High ruleth over the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he pleaseth.
027	DAN	004	033	At the same hour the word was fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar; and from men was he driven away, and herbs like oxen had he to eat, and with the dew of heaven was his body made wet: till his hair was grown like eagles' [feathers], and his nails were like birds' [claws].—
027	DAN	004	034	But at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up my eyes unto heaven, and my understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and glorified the Everliving, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and whose kingdom is over every generation;
027	DAN	004	035	And [by whom] all the inhabitants of the earth are regarded as nought; and [who] according to his pleasure doth with the host of heaven and the inhabitants of the earth; while there is none that can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?
027	DAN	004	036	At the same time my understanding returned unto me; and with the glory of my kingdom, my honor and my splendor returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought for me: and I was replaced in my kingdom, and additional greatness was added unto me.
027	DAN	004	037	Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and glorify the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and whose ways are justice; and who is able to bring low those that walk in pride.
027	DAN	005	001	King Belshazzar prepared a great feast for a thousand of his lords, and before these thousand did he drink wine.
027	DAN	005	002	Belshazzar ordered, through the counsel of the wine, to bring in the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken away out of the temple which was in Jerusalem: that the king, and his lords, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therefrom.
027	DAN	005	003	Then they brought in the golden vessels that were taken away out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his lords, his wives, and his concubines, drank from them.
027	DAN	005	004	They drank wine, and praised their gods of gold, and of silver, of copper, of iron, of wood, and of stone.
027	DAN	005	005	At that same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote opposite to the chandelier upon the plaster of the wall of the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.
027	DAN	005	006	Then was the king's color changed, and his thoughts troubled him: so that the bands of his loins were loosed, and his knees knocked one against the other.
027	DAN	005	007	the king called with might to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. The king commenced, and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whatsoever man will read this writing, and tell me its interpretation, shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall rule as the third in the kingdom.
027	DAN	005	008	Then came in all the wise men of the king; but they were not able to read the writing, nor to make its interpretation known to the king.
027	DAN	005	009	Then was king Belshazzar greatly terrified, and his color was changed on him, and his lords were confounded.
027	DAN	005	010	[Now] the queen in consequence of the words of the king and of his lords came into the banquet-house; the queen commenced and said, O king, live for ever; let thy thoughts not trouble thee, nor let thy color be changed:
027	DAN	005	011	There is a man in thy kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father enlightenment and intelligence and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, were found in him: and king Nebuchadnezzar thy father appointed him chief of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers: —yes, thy father, O king.—
027	DAN	005	012	Forasmuch as a superior spirit, and knowledge, and intelligence, interpreting of dreams, and solving of riddles, and of untying knotty [doubts], were found in him, in Daniel, to whom the king assigned the name of Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will tell the interpretation.
027	DAN	005	013	Then was Daniel brought in before the king: the king commenced and said unto Daniel, Art thou Daniel, who art of the children of the exiles of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Judah?
027	DAN	005	014	And I have heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that enlightenment and intelligence and superior wisdom are found in thee.
027	DAN	005	015	And now the wise men, the astrologers, had been brought before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me its interpretation; but they were not able to tell the interpretation of the matter.
027	DAN	005	016	But I have truly heard concerning thee, that thou art able to give interpretations, and untie knotty [doubts]: now if thou art able to read the writing, and make known to me its interpretation, thou shalt be clothed with purple, with a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt rule as the third in the kingdom.
027	DAN	005	017	Then answered Daniel and said before the king, Let thy gifts remain in thy possession, and bestow thy bounty on another: nevertheless will I read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation.
027	DAN	005	018	O thou king! the most high God gave kingdom, and greatness, and glory, and honor unto Nebuchadnezzar thy father;
027	DAN	005	019	And because of the greatness that he had given unto him, all people, nations, and languages trembled and shook before him: whom he pleased he slew; and whom he pleased he kept alive; and whom he pleased he lifted up; and whom he pleased he brought low.
027	DAN	005	020	But, when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit hardened to deal presumptuously, he was cast down from the throne of his kingdom, and his dignity did they take from him;
027	DAN	005	021	And from the sons of men was he driven forth, and his heart became equal with [that of] the beasts, and with the wild asses was his dwelling; they suffered him to eat herbs like oxen, and with the dew of heaven was his body made wet: till he acknowledged that the most high God ruleth over the kingdom of men, and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he pleaseth.
027	DAN	005	022	And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thy heart, though thou knewest all this;
027	DAN	005	023	But against the Lord of heaven hast thou lifted thyself up; and the vessels of his house have they brought before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk wine from them; and the gods of silver, and gold, of copper, iron, wood, and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor know, hast thou praised; and the God in whose hand thy soul is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified:
027	DAN	005	024	Thereupon was sent from before him the part of the hand, and this writing was noted down.
027	DAN	005	025	And this is the writing that was noted down, M'ne, M'ne, T'kel, Upharsin.
027	DAN	005	026	This the interpretation of the matter: M'ne, God hath numbered thy kingdom, and made an end of it.
027	DAN	005	027	T'kel, Thou least been weighed in the balances, and been found wanting.
027	DAN	005	028	P'ress; Thy kingdom hath been divided, and is given to the Medes and Persians.
027	DAN	005	029	Then gave Belshazzar the order, and they clothed Daniel with purple, with a chain of gold about his neck, and they made a proclamation concerning him, that he should rule as the third in the kingdom.
027	DAN	005	030	In that very night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.
027	DAN	005	031	And Darius the Median obtained the kingdom, when he was sixty and two years old.
027	DAN	006	001	Darius deemed it proper, and he set over the kingdom one hundred and twenty lieutenants, who should be over all the kingdom;
027	DAN	006	002	And over these, three presidents, of whom Daniel was one; that these lieutenants should give accounts unto them, so that the king might suffer no damage.
027	DAN	006	003	Then did this Daniel excel [all] the presidents and lieutenants, because a superior spirit was in him: and the king thought to appoint him over the whole kingdom.
027	DAN	006	004	Then sought the presidents and lieutenants to find a pretext against Daniel on account of the management of the kingdom; but they were not able to find any pretext or fault, forasmuch as he was faithful, and no kind of error or fault was to be found on him.
027	DAN	006	005	Then said these men, We shall not find any pretext against this Daniel, except we find it against him in the law of his God.
027	DAN	006	006	Then came these presidents and lieutenants tumultuously to the king, and thus said they unto him, King Darius, live for ever.
027	DAN	006	007	All the presidents of the kingdom, the superintendents, and the lieutenants, the counsellors, and the governors, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm prohibition, that whosoever will ask any thing by prayer of any God or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions.
027	DAN	006	008	Now, O king, establish the prohibition, and sign the writing, that it cannot be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which is not to be repealed.
027	DAN	006	009	In view of this king Darius signed the writing and the prohibition.
027	DAN	006	010	Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went up unto his house, where he had open windows in his upper chamber in the direction of Jerusalem; and three times every day he kneeled upon his knees, and prayed, and offered thanks before his God, as he had been doing before that time.
027	DAN	006	011	Then came in these men tumultuously, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God.
027	DAN	006	012	Then came they near, and spoke before the king concerning the king's prohibition, Hast thou not signed a prohibition, that every man that will pray [for aught] of any God or man, within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is certainly so, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot he repealed.
027	DAN	006	013	Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, who is of the children of the exiles of Judah, hath paid no regard to thee, O king, nor to the prohibition which thou hast signed; but three times every day he offereth up his prayer.
027	DAN	006	014	Then the king, when he heard this matter, felt very much distressed within himself, and on account of Daniel he sought an excuse to deliver him; and till the going down of the sun he strove hard to rescue him.
027	DAN	006	015	Then came these men tumultuously unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that it is the law of the Medes and Persians. That every prohibition and statute which the king hath established is not to be changed.
027	DAN	006	016	Then gave the king the order, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. The king commenced and said unto Daniel, May thy God whom thou worshippest continually, truly deliver thee.
027	DAN	006	017	And a stone was brought, and placed upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet-ring, and with the signet-ring of his lords, that nothing should be changed in the purpose concerning Daniel.
027	DAN	006	018	Then went the king to his palace, and passed the night fasting: and no food was brought before him; and his sleep fled from him.
027	DAN	006	019	Then arose the king by the morning-dawn, as soon as it was light, and went in great haste unto the den of lions.
027	DAN	006	020	And when he came near to the den, he cried with a mournful voice unto Daniel: the king commenced and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, hath thy God, whom thou worshippest continually, been able to deliver thee from the lions!
027	DAN	006	021	Then spoke Daniel with the king, O king, live for ever.
027	DAN	006	022	My God sent his angel, and locked up the mouths of the lions, and they have not hurt me; forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, had I done nothing injurious.
027	DAN	006	023	Then was the king exceedingly glad within himself, and concerning Daniel he ordered to bring him up out of the den. So was Daniel brought up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he had trusted in his God.
027	DAN	006	024	And the king gave the order, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel treacherously, and they cast into the den of lions them, their children, and their wives; and they had not yet touched the bottom of the den when the lions had the mastery over them, and ground up all their bones.
027	DAN	006	025	Then wrote king Darius unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell on all the earth, May your welfare increase.
027	DAN	006	026	From me is it decreed, That in all the dominion of my kingdom men shall tremble and have fear before the God of Daniel; for he is the living God, and endureth for ever, and it is his kingdom which will not be destroyed, and his dominion will be unto the end [of things].
027	DAN	006	027	He delivereth and rescueth, and he displayeth sings and wonders in heaven and on earth, he who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.
027	DAN	006	028	So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
027	DAN	007	001	In the first year of Belshazzar the king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream and the visions of his head while on his couch: afterward he wrote down the dream, relating the principal things.
027	DAN	007	002	Daniel commenced and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of heaven blew fiercely on the great sea.
027	DAN	007	003	And four great beasts came up from the sea, differing one from another.
027	DAN	007	004	the first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I looked till its wings were plucked out, and it was lifted up from the earth, and was placed upon its feet as a man, and a human heart was given to it.
027	DAN	007	005	And behold there was another, a second beast, like a bear, and on one side was it placed, with three ribs in its mouth between its teeth: and thus they said unto it, Arise, eat much flesh.
027	DAN	007	006	After this I looked, and lo there was another, like a leopard; and it had four wings of a bird on its back: the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given unto it.
027	DAN	007	007	After this I looked in the night visions, and behold there was a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and ground up, and what was left it stamped with its feet; and it was different from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.
027	DAN	007	008	I looked carefully at the horns, and, behold, another little horn came up between them, and three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots before the same; and, behold, there were eyes like the eyes of man in this horn, with a mouth speaking presumptuous things.
027	DAN	007	009	I was looking until chairs were set down, and an Ancient of days seated himself, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of whose head was like clean wool; his chair was like flames of fire, and his wheels like fire that burnt;
027	DAN	007	010	A stream of fire issued and came forth from before him; thousand times thousands ministered unto him, and myriad times myriads stood before him: they sat down to hold judgment, and the books were opened.
027	DAN	007	011	I looked then, because of the sound of the presumptuous words which the horn had spoken, —I looked till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and given over to the burning fire.
027	DAN	007	012	But concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet a longer duration of life was given unto them until the time and period.
027	DAN	007	013	I looked in the nightly visions, and, behold, with the clouds of heaven came one like a son of man, and he attained as far as the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.
027	DAN	007	014	And there were given him dominion, and dignity, and government, and all people, nations, and languages had to serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom is one which shall never be destroyed.
027	DAN	007	015	My spirit was deeply shaken within me, Daniel, in the midst of its tenement, and the visions of my head troubled me.
027	DAN	007	016	I came near unto one of those that stood by, and asked him something certain concerning all this: and he spoke to me, and made known unto me the interpretation of the things.
027	DAN	007	017	These great beasts, of which there are four, are four kings, who are to arise on the earth.
027	DAN	007	018	But the saints of the Most High will obtain the kingdom, and possess the kingdom to eternity, even to all eternity for ever.
027	DAN	007	019	Then I desired what is certain concerning the fourth beast, which was different from all these others, exceedingly dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and whose nails of copper; which devoured, ground up, and stamped with its feet what was left;
027	DAN	007	020	And concerning the ten horns that were in its head, and concerning the other which came up, and before which three fell down, even concerning that horn which had eyes, and a mouth which spoke presumptuous things, and whose appearance was greater than that of its companions.
027	DAN	007	021	I had seen how the same horn had made war with the saints, and had prevailed against them:
027	DAN	007	022	Until the Ancient of days came, and procured justice unto the saints of the Most High; and the time came and the saints took possession of the kingdom.
027	DAN	007	023	Thus said he, The fourth beast [signifieth that] a fourth kingdom will be upon earth, which is to be different from all kingdoms, and will devour all the earth, and will tread it down, and grind it up.
027	DAN	007	024	And the ten horns out of this kingdom [signify] that ten kings will arise; and another will rise after them, and he will be different from the first, and three kings will he bring low.
027	DAN	007	025	And he will speak words against the Most High, and the saints of the Most High will he oppress, and think to change the festivals and the law: and they will be given up into his hand until a time and times and half a time.
027	DAN	007	026	But they will sit down to hold judgment, and they will take away his dominion, to destroy and to annihilate it unto the end.
027	DAN	007	027	And the kingdom and the dominion, and the power over the kingdoms under the whole heaven, will be given to the people of the saints of the Most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all governments are to worship and obey him.
027	DAN	007	028	Thus far is the end of the speech. As for me Daniel, my reflections troubled me greatly, and my color was changed on me; but I kept the speech in my heart.
027	DAN	008	001	In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, to me Daniel, after that which had appeared unto me at the first.
027	DAN	008	002	And I saw in the vision—and it came to pass, in my seeing, that I was at Shushan the capital, which is in the province of 'Elam; —and I saw in the vision, as though I was by the river Ulai.
027	DAN	008	003	And I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, there was a ram standing before the river, and he had two horns; and the horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher one came up last.
027	DAN	008	004	I saw the ram butting westward, and northward, and southward; so that all the beasts could not stand before him, and no one was there to deliver out of his hand: and he did according to his will, and became great.
027	DAN	008	005	And as I was looking attentively, behold, there came a shaggy, he-goat from the west over the face of the whole earth, without touching the ground; and the goat had a sightly large horn between his eyes.
027	DAN	008	006	And he came as far as the ram that had two horns, that I had seen standing before the river, and ran at him with his furious power.
027	DAN	008	007	And I saw him coming close unto the ram, and he became bitterly enraged against him, and he struck the ram, and broke his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand forward before him: and he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him; and there was no one to deliver the ram out of his hand.
027	DAN	008	008	And the shaggy he-goat became very great: but when he was grown strong, the great horn was broken; and there came up four slightly large ones in its place toward the four winds of heaven.
027	DAN	008	009	And out of them came forth a little horn, which became exceedingly great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious land.
027	DAN	008	010	And it became great, even up to the host of the heavens; and it cast down to the ground some of the host and of the stars, and trod them under foot.
027	DAN	008	011	Yea, it magnified itself even up to the prince of the host, and by it the continual sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.
027	DAN	008	012	And the host is given up together with the continual sacrifice, by reason of transgression: and it casteth down the truth to the ground, and it doth [this], and is prosperous.
027	DAN	008	013	Then did I hear a certain holy one speaking, and a holy one said unto the unknown one who was speaking, For how long is the vision concerning the continual sacrifice, and the wasting transgression, to give up both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?
027	DAN	008	014	And he said unto me, Until two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings, when the sanctuary shall be justified.
027	DAN	008	015	And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, saw the vision, and sought for understanding, that, behold, there was standing opposite to me something like the appearance of a man.
027	DAN	008	016	And I heard the voice of a man between [the banks of] the Ulai, and it called, and said, Gabriel, cause this one to understand this appearance.
027	DAN	008	017	So he came close to where I stood: and when he came, I was terrified, and I fell upon my face; but he said unto me, Mark it well, O son of man; because for the time of the end is the vision.
027	DAN	008	018	Now as he was speaking with me, I fell down in amazement on my face to the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright where I had been standing.
027	DAN	008	019	And he said, Behold, I will make known unto thee what is to be at the last end of the indignation; for it is for the appointed time of the end.
027	DAN	008	020	The ram that thou hast seen, him with the two horns, [signifieth] the kings of Media and Persia.
027	DAN	008	021	And the shaggy he-goat is the king of Javan; and the great horn which is between his eyes is the first king.
027	DAN	008	022	But that it was broken, and that four sprung up in its stead, [signifieth that] four kingdoms will spring up out of the nation, but not with his power.
027	DAN	008	023	And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors have filled their measure of guilt, there will arise a king of an impudent face, and understanding deep schemes.
027	DAN	008	024	And his power will be mighty, but not by his own power; and he will destroy wonderfully, and will prosper while he doth [this]; and he will destroy very many and the people of the saints.
027	DAN	008	025	And through his intelligence, and because he prospereth, is craftiness in his hand; and in his heart will he magnify himself, and in peace will he destroy many: he will also stand up against the Prince of princes; but without a human hand will he be broken.
027	DAN	008	026	And the appearance of the evening and the morning which was spoken of is true: but do thou keep the vision closed up;
027	DAN	008	027	And I Daniel grieved, and was sick several days; afterward I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was depressed because of the appearance; but no one observed it.
027	DAN	009	001	In the first year of Darius the son of Achashverosh, of the seed of the Medes, who was made king over the kingdom of the Chaldeans,
027	DAN	009	002	In the first year of his reign, I Daniel searched in the books for understanding concerning the number of the years whereof the word of the Lord had come to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would let pass full seventy years over the ruins of Jerusalem.
027	DAN	009	003	And I directed my face unto the Lord God, to ask by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and in sackcloth, and ashes.
027	DAN	009	004	And I prayed unto the Lord my God, and made my confession, and said, O Lord, the great and terrible God, who keepeth the covenant and kindness to those that love him, and to those that keep his commandments:
027	DAN	009	005	We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, and have departed from thy commandments and from thy ordinances;
027	DAN	009	006	Nor have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, who spoke in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.
027	DAN	009	007	Thine, O Lord, is the righteousness, but unto us belongeth the shame of face, as it is this day, —to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, those that are near, and those that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their trespass which they have trespassed against thee.
027	DAN	009	008	O Lord, to us belongeth the shame of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers; because we have sinned against thee.
027	DAN	009	009	To the Lord our God belong mercies and pardonings; for we have rebelled against him;
027	DAN	009	010	And we have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us through means of his servants the prophets.
027	DAN	009	011	Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, and have departed so as not to obey thy voice: therefore was poured out over us the curse, with the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God; because we had sinned against him.
027	DAN	009	012	And he hath accomplished his words, which he had spoken concerning us, and concerning our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil, which was never done under the whole heaven as it hath been done in Jerusalem.
027	DAN	009	013	As it is written in the law of Moses; all this evil came over us: yet offered we not any entreaty before the Lord our God, to return from our iniquities, and to become intelligent in thy truth.
027	DAN	009	014	Therefore did the Lord watch over the evil, and he brought it upon us; for the Lord our God is righteous because of all his deeds which he hath done; but we have not obeyed his voice.
027	DAN	009	015	And now, O Lord our God, who hast brought forth thy people out of the land of Egypt with a strong hand, and hast made thyself a [great] name, as it is this day: we have sinned, we have done wickedly.
027	DAN	009	016	O Lord, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee, let thy anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain; because through our sins, and through the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all who are round about us.
027	DAN	009	017	And now listen, O our God, to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary which is desolate, for the sake of the Lord.
027	DAN	009	018	Incline, O my God, thy ear, and hear; open thy eyes, and look on our desolations, and the city whereupon thy name is called: for not [relying] on our acts of righteousness do we present humbly our supplications before thee, but [relying] on thy great mercies.
027	DAN	009	019	O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do it; delay it not; for thy own sake, O my God; for thy name is called upon thy city and upon thy people.
027	DAN	009	020	And while I was yet speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication humbly before the Lord my God because of the holy mountain of my God:
027	DAN	009	021	Yea, while I was yet speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, came, flying swiftly, near me about the time of the evening oblation.
027	DAN	009	022	And he gave me understanding, and spoke with me, and said, O Daniel, now am I come forth to make thee intelligent with understanding.
027	DAN	009	023	At the beginning of thy supplications the word went forth, and I am come to tell it; for thou art greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and have understanding of the appearance.
027	DAN	009	024	Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to close up the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to atone for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most holy thing.
027	DAN	009	025	Know therefore and comprehend, that from the going forth of the word to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the anointed the prince will be seven weeks: and during sixty and two weeks will it be again built with streets and ditches [around it], even in the pressure of the times.
027	DAN	009	026	And after the sixty and two weeks will an anointed one be cut off without a successor to follow him: and the city and the sanctuary will the people of the prince that is coming destroy; but his end will come in a violent overthrow; but until the end of the war devastations are decreed [against it].
027	DAN	009	027	And he will make a strong covenant with the many for one week; and in the half of the week will he cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and this because of the prevalence of the abominations which bringeth devastation, and until destruction and what is decreed shall be poured out upon the waster.
027	DAN	010	001	In the third year of Cyrus the king of Persia a word was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the word is the truth, but the time appointed is long off: and he noted the word, and took notice of it in the appearance.
027	DAN	010	002	In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.
027	DAN	010	003	Costly food did I not eat, and flesh and wine came not in my mouth, nor did I at all anoint myself, till three whole weeks were elapsed.
027	DAN	010	004	And on the four and twentieth day of the first month, while I was by the side of the great river, which is Chiddekel,
027	DAN	010	005	I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold there was a certain man clothed in linen, and his loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz;
027	DAN	010	006	And his body was also like the chrysolite, and his face, like the appearance of lightning, and his eyes were like torches of fire, and his arms and his feet, like the color of polished copper, and the sound of his words was like the noise of a multitude.
027	DAN	010	007	And I Daniel saw alone this appearance; but the men that were with me did not see the appearance: nevertheless a great terror fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves.
027	DAN	010	008	And I was left by myself alone, and I saw this great appearance, and there remained no strength in me; and my healthy color was changed on me into corruption, and I retained no strength.
027	DAN	010	009	Then heard I the sound of his words; and as I heard the sound of his words, I sank in amazement on my face, with my face toward the ground.
027	DAN	010	010	And, behold, a hand touched me, and it moved me upon my knees and the palms of my hands.
027	DAN	010	011	And he said unto me, O Daniel, the man greatly beloved, mark well the words that I speak unto thee, and stand on thy standing-place; for now have I been sent unto thee. And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood up trembling.
027	DAN	010	012	And he said unto me, Fear not, Daniel; for from the first day that thou didst set thy heart to obtain understanding, and to fast before thy God, were thy words heard: and I am come in consequence of thy words.
027	DAN	010	013	But the prince of the kingdom of Persia stood up against me one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I obtained the victory there with the kings of Persia.
027	DAN	010	014	Now am I come to make thee understand what is to befall thy people, in the latter days; for the vision is yet for the [coming] days.
027	DAN	010	015	And when he spoke unto me such words, I directed my face toward the ground, and I became dumb.
027	DAN	010	016	And, behold, something like the form of the sons of men touched my lips; and I opened my mouth, and I spoke, and said unto him that stood opposite to me, O my lord, because of the appearance my pains suddenly overcame me, and I have retained no strength.
027	DAN	010	017	And how shall the servant of this my lord be able to speak with this my lord? And as for me, from that moment there remained no strength in me, and no breath was left in me.
027	DAN	010	018	Then there touched me again something like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me;
027	DAN	010	019	And he said, Fear not, O man greatly beloved: peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he spoke with me, I felt myself strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.
027	DAN	010	020	Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I am come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia; and as I am going forth, lo, the prince of Javan is coming.
027	DAN	010	021	Nevertheless will I tell thee what is noted down in the writing of truth: —and there is none that holdeth with me [to assist me] against those, except Michael your prince.
027	DAN	011	001	And I in the first year of Darius the Mede had my station to assist and to protect him.
027	DAN	011	002	And now will I tell thee the truth. Behold, there will stand up yet three kings of Persia: and the fourth will obtain far greater riches than all [these]: and when he is strong through his riches will he stir up all, [namely,] the kingdom of Javan.
027	DAN	011	003	And then will stand up a mighty king, who will rule with great dominion, and do according to his pleasure.
027	DAN	011	004	And when he shall have stood, his kingdom will be broken, and will be divided toward the four winds of the heavens, and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled; for his kingdom will be torn asunder even for others beside those.
027	DAN	011	005	And the king of the south will become strong, yea, he who is one of his princes; but [another] will become strong against him, and will rule: a great dominion will his dominion be.
027	DAN	011	006	But at the end of [some] years will they associate themselves together; and the daughter of the king of the south will come to the king of the north to make a settlement of difficulties; but she will not retain the power of the support; neither will he stand, nor his support: but she will be given up with those that had brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in those times.
027	DAN	011	007	But there will up a sprout of her roots in his place, and he will come to the army, and will enter into the stronghold of the king of the north, and will deal with them, and prevail:
027	DAN	011	008	And also their gods with their molten images, with their precious vessels of silver and of gold, will he carry into captivity to Egypt; and he will stand off some years from the king of the north.
027	DAN	011	009	But this one will then enter the kingdom of the king of the south, and then return into his own land.
027	DAN	011	010	But his sons will commence a war, and assemble a multitude of great armies; and one will certainly enter, and overflow, and pass along: then will he return, and make war again, even to his stronghold.
027	DAN	011	011	And the king of the south will be moved with bitter wrath, and go forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north: and he will set forth a great multitude; but the multitude [of the other] will be given up into his hand.
027	DAN	011	012	And the multitude will be lifted up, and his heart will become proud; and he will cast down myriads; but he will not be strengthened by it.
027	DAN	011	013	And the king of the north will return, and set forth a multitude greater than the former; and at the end of the times, of years, will he certainly come with a great army and with much riches.
027	DAN	011	014	And in those times many will stand up against the king of the south: also the rebellious sons of thy people will lift themselves up to establish the vision; but they will stumble.
027	DAN	011	015	And the king of the north will come, and cast up a mound, and capture the city defended by fortifications: and the arms of the south will not withstand, and as regardeth his chosen people, there will be no power [in them] to withstand.
027	DAN	011	016	But he that cometh against them will do according to his pleasure, and none will stand before him; and he will place himself in the glorious land, which will be altogether in his hand.
027	DAN	011	017	He will also direct his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, having professions of peace with him; and thus will he do it: and he will give him the daughter of his wife to destroy it: but it will not stand, and it will not remain his.
027	DAN	011	018	And he will direct his face unto the isles, and capture many; but a chieftain will cause to cease his reproach against him: without his giving back to him his own reproach.
027	DAN	011	019	Then will he direct his face toward the strong-holds of his own land; but he will stumble and fall, and will no more be found.
027	DAN	011	020	And there will stand up in his place one who will cause the exactor [of taxes] to pass through the glorious [land] of the kingdom; but within a few days will he be broken, but not in anger, nor in battle.
027	DAN	011	021	And there will stand up in his place a despicable person, to whom they assigned not the honor of the kingdom; but he will come in quietly, and lay hold of the kingdom by flatteries.
027	DAN	011	022	And the powers of the overflow will be swept away from before him, and will be broken: yea, so also the prince in covenant [with him].
027	DAN	011	023	And from the time of his associating with him will he deal deceitfully; and he will come up, and obtain the victory with a small number of people.
027	DAN	011	024	In quiet and into the fattest portion of the province will he enter; and he will do what his fathers have not done, nor his fathers' fathers: the prey, and spoil, and riches will he divide freely to them, and against the strong-holds will he devise his plans, but only till a certain time.
027	DAN	011	025	And he will then stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army: and the king of the south will prepare himself for the war with an exceedingly great and mighty army; but he will not stand; for they will devise [evil] plans against him.
027	DAN	011	026	Yea, they that eat of his food will bring his downfall, and the army of the other will overflow; and many will fall down slain.
027	DAN	011	027	And as for both these kings, their heart is bent on mischief, and at one table will they speak lies; but it shall not prosper; for the end is yet for the time appointed.
027	DAN	011	028	Then will he return into his land with great riches, and his heart will be against the holy covenant: and he will do it, and return to his own land.
027	DAN	011	029	At the time appointed will he return, and enter into the south; but not as in the former will it be in the latter time.
027	DAN	011	030	For there will come against him the ships of Kittim; and he will become faint-hearted, and return, and will rage against the holy covenant; and he will do it: and he will return, and have an understanding with those that forsake the holy covenant.
027	DAN	011	031	And the army divisions will proceed from him, and they will defile the sanctuary, the fortress, and remove the continual sacrifice, and they will set up the desolating abomination.
027	DAN	011	032	And such as act wickedly against the covenant will he corrupt by flatteries; but the people that do know their God will be strong, and deal [valiantly].
027	DAN	011	033	And the intelligent among the people will impart understanding to many: yet they will stumble through the sword, and through flame, through captivity, and through being plundered for some time.
027	DAN	011	034	But in their stumbling will they be aided with a little help: but many will join themselves to them with deceptive flatteries.
027	DAN	011	035	And some of the intelligent will stumble, to make a purification among them, and to select and to cleanse them, until the time of the end; because it is yet for the time appointed.
027	DAN	011	036	And the king will do according to his pleasure; and he will exalt and magnify himself above every god, and against the God of gods will he speak incredible things, and he will prosper till the indignation be at an end; for that which is determined will be accomplished.
027	DAN	011	037	And to the gods of his fathers will he pay no regard; and to the desire of women, or to any god whatever will he not pay any regard; for above all will he magnify himself.
027	DAN	011	038	But in his place he will pay honor to the god of the fortresses; and to a god whom his fathers knew not will he pay honor with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and costly things.
027	DAN	011	039	This will he do for the very strong fortresses together with the strange god: whoever will acknowledge him, him will he give much honor; and he will cause such to rule over many, and he will divide out the land for a price.
027	DAN	011	040	And at the time of the end will the king of the south push against him; and the king of the north will come against him like a storm-wind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he will enter into some countries, and will overflow and press along.
027	DAN	011	041	And he will enter into the glorious land, and much will be overthrown; but these will escape out of his hand, even Edom, and Moab, and the first portion of the children of 'Ammon.
027	DAN	011	042	And he will stretch forth his hand against some countries, and the land of Egypt will not escape.
027	DAN	011	043	And he will have control over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the costly things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians will follow at his steps.
027	DAN	011	044	But reports out of the east and out of the north will terrify him; and he will go forth with great fury to destroy, and to exterminate many.
027	DAN	011	045	And he will pitch the tents of his palace between seas and the glorious holy mountain; and he will come to his end, without one to help him.
027	DAN	012	001	And at that time will Michael, the great prince who standeth for the children of thy people, stand forth; and there will be a time of distress, such as hath never been since the existence of any nation, until that same time; and at that time shall thy people be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.
027	DAN	012	002	And many of those that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to disgrace and everlasting abhorrence.
027	DAN	012	003	And the intelligent shall shine brilliantly like the brilliance of the expanse [of the sky]; and they that bring many to righteousness shall be like the stars, for ever and ever.
027	DAN	012	004	But thou, O Daniel, close up the words, and seal the book, until the time of the end: many will roam about, yet shall knowledge be increased.
027	DAN	012	005	Then I Daniel looked, and behold, there were two others standing, the one on this side of the bank of the stream, and the other on that side of the bank of the stream.
027	DAN	012	006	And one said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the stream, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?
027	DAN	012	007	Then heard I the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the stream; and he lifted up his right hand and his left hand unto the heavens, and swore by the Everliving One that after a time, times, and a half, and when there shall be an end to the crushing of the power of the holy people, all these things shall be ended.
027	DAN	012	008	And I heard indeed, but I understood it not: then said I, O my lord, what shall be the end of these things?
027	DAN	012	009	And he said, Go [thy way], Daniel; for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end.
027	DAN	012	010	Many shall be selected and cleansed, and purified; but the wicked will deal wickedly, and none of the wicked will understand: but the intelligent will understand.
027	DAN	012	011	And from the time that the continual sacrifice will be removed, even to set up the desolating abomination, there will be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.
027	DAN	012	012	Happy is he that waiteth, and attaineth to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days.
027	DAN	012	013	But thou, go [thy way] toward the end; and thou shalt rest, and arise again for thy lot at the end of the days.

# BOOK	028	HOS	Hosea	Hosea
028	HOS	001	001	The word of the Lord that came unto Hosea the son of Beeri, in the days of 'Uzziyah, Jotham, Achaz, [and] Hezekiah, the kings of Judah, and in the days of Jerobo'am the son of Joash the king of Israel.
028	HOS	001	002	The beginning of the word of the Lord by Hosea was, that the Lord said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of prostitution and children of prostitution; for the [inhabitants of the] land go far astray, departing from the Lord.
028	HOS	001	003	So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblayim, and she conceived and bore him a son.
028	HOS	001	004	And the Lord said unto him, Call his name Yizre'el; for but yet a little while, when I will visit the blood of Yizre'el upon the house of Jehu, and I will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.
028	HOS	001	005	And it shall come to pass on that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Yizre'el.
028	HOS	001	006	And she conceived again, and bore a daughter: and he said unto him, Call her name Lo-ruchamah [Not finding mercy]; for I will not farther have any more mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will give them their full recompense.
028	HOS	001	007	But upon the house of Judah will I have mercy, and I will save them through the Lord their God, and I will not save them by the bow, or by the sword, or by battle, by horses, or by horsemen.
028	HOS	001	008	Now when she had weaned Lo-ruchamah, she conceived, and bore a son.
028	HOS	001	009	Then said he, Call his name Lo-'ammi [Not my people]; for ye are not my people, and I will indeed not be unto you [a God].
028	HOS	001	010	Yet shall the number of the children of Israel [once] be like the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that instead that people say of them, Ye are not my people [Lo-'ammi], shall they call them, The sons of the living God.
028	HOS	001	011	Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and they will appoint for themselves one head, and they shall go up out of the land, for great shall be the day of Yizre'el.
028	HOS	002	001	Call ye your brothers, 'Ammi [my people]; and your sisters, Ruchamah [That hath obtained mercy].
028	HOS	002	002	Contend with your mother, contend; for she is not my wife, and I am not her husband; but let her put away her prostitution from her face, and her adulteries from between her breasts:
028	HOS	002	003	Lest I strip her naked, and set her, as on the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and render her like a dry land, and let her die with thirst.
028	HOS	002	004	And upon her children will I not have mercy; for they are children of prostitution;
028	HOS	002	005	For their mother hath played the harlot; she that conceived them hath done shamefully; for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.
028	HOS	002	006	Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and I will close it up with a fence, that she shall not find her paths.
028	HOS	002	007	And she will make pursuit after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she will seek them, but shall not find them: then will she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for it was better with me then than now.
028	HOS	002	008	But she indeed did not acknowledge, that it was I that had given her the corn, and the wine, and the oil, and multiplied for her silver and gold, which they devoted for Ba'al.
028	HOS	002	009	Therefore will I turn back, and take away my corn in its time, and my wine in its season, and I will snatch away my wool and my flax, [given] to cover her nakedness.
028	HOS	002	010	And now will I lay open her disgrace before the eyes of her lovers, and no man shall deliver her out of my hand.
028	HOS	002	011	And I will cause to cease all her mirth, her festival, her new-moon, and her sabbath, and all her appointed feasts.
028	HOS	002	012	And I will make desolate her vine and her fig-tree, whereof she hath said, These are my reward which my lovers have given me: and I will change them into a forest, and the beasts of the field shall devour them.
028	HOS	002	013	And I will visit upon her the days of the Be'alim, to which she used to burn incense, when she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and went after her lovers, and me she forgot, saith the Lord.
028	HOS	002	014	Therefore, behold, will I allure her, and lead her forth into the wilderness, and I will speak comfortingly unto her heart.
028	HOS	002	015	And I will give her [again] her vineyards from there, and the valley of 'Achor [sorrow] as an entrance for hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as on the day of her coming up out of the land of Egypt.
028	HOS	002	016	And it shall happen at that day, saith the Lord, that thou shalt call me Ishi [my husband], and shalt not call me any more Ba'ali [my lord].
028	HOS	002	017	For I will remove the names of the Be'alim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be mentioned by their name.
028	HOS	002	018	And I will make for them a covenant on that day with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of the heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and bow, and sword, and war I will break away out of the land, and I will cause them to lie down in safety.
028	HOS	002	019	And I will betroth thee unto me for ever: yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in justice, and in loving-kindness, and in mercy.
028	HOS	002	020	And I will betroth thee unto me in faithfulness; and thou shalt know the Lord.
028	HOS	002	021	And it shall come to pass on that day, that I will answer prayer, saith the Lord, I will answer the heavens, and they shall answer the earth;
028	HOS	002	022	And the earth shall answer the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall answer Yizre'el.
028	HOS	002	023	And I will sow her for me in the land; and I will have mercy upon “Her that had not obtained mercy” [Lo-ruchamah]; and I will say to those who were “Not my people” [Lo-'ammi], Thou art my people: and they shall say, Thou art my God.
028	HOS	003	001	Then said the Lord unto me, Go once more, love a woman beloved of her husband, yet committing adultery; like the love of the Lord toward the children of Israel, who turn themselves after other gods, and love flagons of wine.
028	HOS	003	002	So I bought me such a one for fifteen pieces of silver, and for a chomer of barley, and half a chomer of barley.
028	HOS	003	003	And I said unto her, Many days shalt thou abide [true] for me: thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not belong to any man, and so will I also be toward thee.
028	HOS	003	004	For many days shall the children of Israel abide without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without a standing image, and without an ephod and theraphim.
028	HOS	003	005	After that will the children of Israel return, and seek for the Lord their God and David their king; and fearing will they hasten to the Lord and to his goodness in the latter days,
028	HOS	004	001	Hear the word of the Lord, ye children of Israel; for the Lord hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land; because there is no truth, nor kindness, nor knowledge of God in the land.
028	HOS	004	002	There is false swearing, and lying, and murdering, and stealing, and committing adultery: they break the bounds, and blood toucheth on blood.
028	HOS	004	003	Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of the heaven; yea, also the fishes of the sea shall perish.
028	HOS	004	004	Yet let no man strive, let no man reprove another: and thy people are contentious equally with the priest.
028	HOS	004	005	Therefore shalt thou stumble in the daytime, and the prophet also shall stumble with thee in the night; and I will destroy thy mother.
028	HOS	004	006	My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; because thou hast rejected knowledge, so will I also reject thee, that thou shalt not be a priest to me; and as thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, so will I myself also forget thy children.
028	HOS	004	007	The more they increased, the more did they sin against me: therefore will I change their glory into shame.
028	HOS	004	008	The sin-offering of my people do they eat, and for their iniquity doth the soul of each one of them long.
028	HOS	004	009	Therefore shall the same befall both people and priest: and I will punish every one of them for his ways, and recompense every one for his doings.
028	HOS	004	010	And they will eat, and shall not be satisfied; they will commit lewdness, and they shall not increase; because the Lord have they forsaken [not] keeping [his law].
028	HOS	004	011	Lewdness and wine and new wine take away the heart.
028	HOS	004	012	My people ask counsel of their stick of wood, and their staff shall tell them [the future]: for the spirit of lewdness hath caused them to err, and they are gone astray unfaithful to their God.
028	HOS	004	013	Upon the tops of the mountains do they sacrifice, and upon the hills burn they incense, under oaks and poplars and terebinths, because their shadow is good: therefore will your daughters play the harlot, and your daughter-in-law will commit adultery.
028	HOS	004	014	I cannot inflict punishment on your daughters when they play the harlot, nor on your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery; for they themselves associate with lewd women, and with harlots do they sacrifice: and so doth the people that doth not understand stumble.
028	HOS	004	015	Yet though thou play the harlot, O Israel, let not Judah offend: and come not ye unto Gilgal, nor go ye up to Beth-aven, nor swear, As the Lord liveth.
028	HOS	004	016	For like an untamable cow is Israel disobedient: now would the Lord have fed them as a sheep in a wide pasture.
028	HOS	004	017	Ephraim is bound to idols: let him alone.
028	HOS	004	018	Their drinking bout will come to an end: while they are so often guilty of lewdness, their rulers love, prepare themselves but shame.
028	HOS	004	019	The wind seizeth fast on them with its wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.
028	HOS	005	001	Hear this, O ye priests; and listen well, O ye house of Israel; and give ye ear, O house of the king; for the punishment threateneth you; because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread out upon Thabor.
028	HOS	005	002	And for murdering they who had rebelled [against God] concealed themselves in deep places; but I will inflict correction on them all.
028	HOS	005	003	I well know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from me; for now, O Ephraim, hast thou played the harlot, [and] Israel is defiled.
028	HOS	005	004	Their doings will not permit them to return unto their God; for the spirit of lewdness is in their bosom, and the Lord they have not known.
028	HOS	005	005	Therefore shall the pride of Israel be humbled before his face: and Israel and Ephraim shall stumble in their iniquity; Judah also shall stumble with them.
028	HOS	005	006	With their flocks and with their herds will they go to seek the Lord; but they shall not find him: he hath withdrawn himself from them.
028	HOS	005	007	Against the Lord have they dealt treacherously; for strange children have they begotten: now shall one month devour them together with their possessions.
028	HOS	005	008	Blow ye the cornet in Gib'ah, the trumpet in Ramah: blow the alarm at Beth-aven, [The enemy is] after thee, O Benjamin.
028	HOS	005	009	Ephraim shall be made desolate on the day of chastisement: among the tribes of Israel had I made known that which is true.
028	HOS	005	010	The princes of Judah were like those that remove the landmark: my wrath, therefore, will I pour out upon them like water.
028	HOS	005	011	Oppressed is Ephraim, broken through punishment; because he willingly walked after the commandment [of false prophets].
028	HOS	005	012	But like the moth became I unto Ephraim, and like rottenness to the house of Judah.
028	HOS	005	013	Then saw Ephraim his sickness, and Judah his wound, and Ephraim went to Asshur, and [the other] sent to the king that should contend [Jareb]; but he will never be able to heal you, nor remove from you your wound.
028	HOS	005	014	For I am as a lion unto Ephraim, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I myself will tear in pieces and go away; I will bear away, and none shall deliver.
028	HOS	005	015	I will go [from here, and] return to my place, till they acknowledge their guilt, and seek my presence: in their affliction will they seek for me.
028	HOS	006	001	“Come, and let us return unto the Lord; for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind up our wounds.
028	HOS	006	002	He will revive us after two days: on the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his presence.
028	HOS	006	003	And let us feel it, that we may strive to know the Lord; bright as the morning-dawn is his rising; and he will come as the rain unto us, as the latter rain that maketh fruitful the earth.”
028	HOS	006	004	What shall I do unto thee, O Ephraim? what shall I do unto thee, O Judah? for your piety is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew that passeth away.
028	HOS	006	005	Therefore did I hew [them] down by means of the prophets; I slew them by the words of my mouth: and thy punishments go forth like the light.
028	HOS	006	006	For piety I desired, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God, more than burnt-offerings.
028	HOS	006	007	But they, like an ordinary man, have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.
028	HOS	006	008	Gil'ad is become a city of workers of wickedness, is full of traces of blood.
028	HOS	006	009	And as troops that lie in wait for a man, so is the band of priests, they murder on the way in unison; for they commit scandalous deeds.
028	HOS	006	010	On the house of Israel have I seen a horrible thing: there is lewdness in Ephraim, Israel is become defiled.
028	HOS	006	011	Also for thee, O Judah, will a harvest be prepared, when I bring back the captivity of my people.
028	HOS	007	001	Should I desire to heal Israel, then would the iniquity of Ephraim and the wickedness of Samaria be laid open; for they commit falsehood; and the thief entereth [secretly], and the troop of robbers is spread abroad without.
028	HOS	007	002	And they never think in their own heart that I remember all their wickedness: though now their own doings are all round about them; before my face are they present.
028	HOS	007	003	With their wickedness they make the king glad, and with their lies the princes.
028	HOS	007	004	They are all adulterers, as an oven well heated by the baker: [when] he that stirreth [the fire] resteth awhile from kneading the dough, until it be leavened.
028	HOS	007	005	On the day of our king's [entering on his rule] the princes are made sick with the fumes of wine: [the king] joineth his hand with scorners.
028	HOS	007	006	For they make ready their heart for their tricky deeds, like the oven, the baker whereof sleepeth all the night, while in the morning it gloweth as a flaming fire.
028	HOS	007	007	They are all hot as an oven, they devour their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me.
028	HOS	007	008	Ephraim mixeth himself indeed among the nations: Ephraim is a cake not turned.
028	HOS	007	009	Strangers devour his strength, and he knoweth it not: yea, gray hairs are sprinkled about on his [head], yet he knoweth not.
028	HOS	007	010	And humbled was the pride of Israel before his own face; but they did not return to the Lord their God, and sought him not, notwithstanding all this.
028	HOS	007	011	And Ephraim is become like a silly dove without understanding: Egypt did they call hither, to Assyria did they go.
028	HOS	007	012	As they go, so will I spread out my net over them; as the fowls of the heaven will I bring them down: I will chastise them, as it hath been announced to their congregation.
028	HOS	007	013	Woe unto them! for they have fled from me; destruction shall come unto them, because they have transgressed against me: though I desired to redeem them, they yet spoke lies against me.
028	HOS	007	014	And they cried not unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: for corn and new wine they assemble themselves, and they rebel against me.
028	HOS	007	015	And I desired to instruct and to strengthen their arms; yet would they devise evil against me.
028	HOS	007	016	They never return upward: they are like a deceitful bow: by the sword shall their princes fall because of the rage of their tongue; this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.
028	HOS	008	001	Set the cornet to thy mouth. [Let the enemy come] like the eagle against the house of the Lord: because they have transgressed my covenant, and against my law have they trespassed.
028	HOS	008	002	To me will they then cry, My God, we, Israel, know thee.
028	HOS	008	003	[But] Israel did reject the good; so let the enemy pursue him.
028	HOS	008	004	They set up kings, but not my advice: they chose princes and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made themselves idols so that they will be cut off.
028	HOS	008	005	Thy calf, O Samaria, hath caused thy rejection; my anger is kindled against them: how long will it be that they cannot cleanse themselves?
028	HOS	008	006	For whom Israel did also that [idol] spring; an artisan made it, and no God is it: so then shall it become broken in splinters— that calf of Samaria.
028	HOS	008	007	For the wind do they sow, and the whirlwind shall they reap: [their seed] bringeth no standing corn; the plant yieldeth no meal; but should it yield it, strangers would swallow it up.
028	HOS	008	008	Swallowed up is Israel: now are they among the nations as a vessel without any value.
028	HOS	008	009	For they are needs gone up to Assyria, they who like a wild ass should dwell alone: Ephraim spendeth lovers' gifts.
028	HOS	008	010	But even though they should spend gifts among the nations, now will I gather them: and they shall be humbled a little through the burden of the king of princes.
028	HOS	008	011	Because Ephraim hath multiplied altars to sin, the altars have been unto him the means of sinning.
028	HOS	008	012	I ever wrote down for him the great things of my law; but as a strange thing are they accounted.
028	HOS	008	013	My sacrificial offerings they slay as common flesh that they may eat it; the Lord accepteth them not in favor: now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins; they shall indeed return to Egypt.
028	HOS	008	014	For Israel forgot his Maker, and built palaces; and Judah multiplied fortified cities; but I will send a fire among his cities, and it shall devour their fine edifices.
028	HOS	009	001	Rejoice not, O Israel, for gladness, as other people; for thou art gone astray, unfaithful to thy God: thou hast loved the wages of sin upon every corn-filled threshing-floor.
028	HOS	009	002	The threshing-floor and the wine-press shall not feed them, and the new wine shall deceive them.
028	HOS	009	003	They shall not dwell in the land of the Lord; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and in Assyria will they eat unclean things.
028	HOS	009	004	They shall not pour out wine to the Lord, and [their offerings] shall not be pleasing unto him; their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted: for this their food can only be for themselves, it shall not come into the house of the Lord.
028	HOS	009	005	What will ye do on the day of the appointed festival, and on the day of the feast of the Lord?
028	HOS	009	006	For, lo, they are gone forth because of the desolation: Egypt will gather them up, Moph will bury them: the pleasant chambers for their silver, —these shall nettles take possession of; thorns shall [grow] in their tents.
028	HOS	009	007	Come are the days of the visitation, come are the days of thy recompense; this shall Israel experience: a fool was the prophet, mad the inspired man, because of the greatness of thy iniquity, and the great hatefulness.
028	HOS	009	008	The watchman of Ephraim with my God, the prophet, was a snare of the fowler on all his ways, a hateful thing in the house of his god.
028	HOS	009	009	They are deeply corrupt, as in the days of Gib'ah: he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.
028	HOS	009	010	Like grapes in the wilderness had I found Israel; as the first ripe fruit on the fig-tree in the first of the season had I seen your fathers; but they too went to Ba'al-pe'or: and devoted themselves unto that shameful idol, and became abominations as those they loved.
028	HOS	009	011	As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird: there is no more birth, and no pregnancy, and no conception.
028	HOS	009	012	But though they were to bring up their children, yet would I bereave them, that there should be no man: yea, woe also to themselves, when I depart from them!
028	HOS	009	013	Ephraim, as I have seen him like Tyre, planted in a pleasant meadow, —yet this Ephraim shall lead forth to the murderer his children.
028	HOS	009	014	Give them, O Lord, what thou wilt give! give them a miscarrying womb and dried-up breasts.
028	HOS	009	015	All their wickedness is in Gilgal; for there I [learnt to] hate them; for the wickedness of their doings will I drive them out of my house: I will love them no farther; all their princes are rebels.
028	HOS	009	016	Smitten is Ephraim, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit; yea, though they should bring forth, yet would I slay the beloved fruit of their body.
028	HOS	009	017	My God will reject them, because they did not hearken unto him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations.
028	HOS	010	001	An emptied vine is Israel; how should he bring forth fruit for himself? the more numerous was his fruit the more he increased the altars; the more prosperous was his land, the more they made goodly statues.
028	HOS	010	002	Their heart is divided; now shall they bear their guilt: this will break down their altars, will devastate their statues.
028	HOS	010	003	For now will they say, We have no king; because we fear not the Lord: and the king—what can he do for us?
028	HOS	010	004	They have spoken [vain] words, swearing falsely in making a covenant: therefore springeth up the punishment as poison in the furrows of the field.
028	HOS	010	005	For the calves of Beth-aven are terrified the inhabitants of Samaria: yea, the people thereof mourn over them, and also its false priests that [before] rejoiced over them, for its glory, because it is departed from it.
028	HOS	010	006	Also this shall be carried unto Assyria for a present to the contentious king: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed because of his own counsel.
028	HOS	010	007	As for Samaria, her king shall vanish like the foam upon the surface of the water.
028	HOS	010	008	And destroyed shall be the high-places of Aven, [the cause of] the sin of Israel; the thorn and the thistle shall grow upon their altars: and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall upon us.
028	HOS	010	009	More than in the days of Gib'ah hast thou sinned, O Israel! there they stood; and the battle in Gib'ah against the children of wickedness did not overtake them.
028	HOS	010	010	[But now] after my desire will I chastise them: and the people shall be gathered against them, when they harness them [for labor] in their two furrows.
028	HOS	010	011	And Ephraim is as a well-taught heifer that loveth to tread out the corn; and I passed over her fair neck: now will I make Ephraim draw the wagon, Judah shall plough, and Jacob shall harrow the field for the enemy.
028	HOS	010	012	Sow then for yourselves after righteousness, that you may reap [the fruit] of kindness; cultivate your fallow field; for it is time to seek the Lord, till he come and rain righteousness down for you.
028	HOS	010	013	[But] ye have ploughed wickedness, iniquity have ye reaped, ye have eaten the fruit of lies; because thou didst trust in thy own way, in the multitude of thy mighty men:
028	HOS	010	014	Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be wasted, as Shalman devastated Beth-arbel on the day of battle, [when] the mother was dashed in pieces upon her children.
028	HOS	010	015	The like of this doth Beth-el procure unto you because of your great wickedness: in the early morning shall utterly pass away the king of Israel.
028	HOS	011	001	When Israel was yet young, then I loved him, and out of Egypt did I call my son.
028	HOS	011	002	The [prophets] called them; but the more they went from them: unto the Be'alim would they sacrifice, and to the graven images would they burn incense.
028	HOS	011	003	Yet I myself appointed a leader for Ephraim, who took them up in his arms; but they would not acknowledge that I healed them.
028	HOS	011	004	With human cords I ever drew them forward, with leading-strings of love: and I was to them as those that lift off the yoke from their jaws, and I held out unto them food.
028	HOS	011	005	He should not return unto the land of Egypt: yet [now] is the Assyrian his king; because they refused to repent.
028	HOS	011	006	And the sword shall fall on his cities, and shall make an end of his boughs, and consume them, because of their [evil] counsels.
028	HOS	011	007	For my people are only bent on backsliding from me; and though upward they call them, they altogether will not elevate themselves.
028	HOS	011	008	How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I surrender thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I change thee as Zeboyim? turned is my heart within me, all my compassion is enkindled together.
028	HOS	011	009	I will not execute the fierceness of my anger, I will not again destroy Ephraim; for God am I, and not man, the Holy One in the midst of thee, and I will not come with an enemy's hatred.
028	HOS	011	010	They shall follow after the Lord, when he will roar like a lion; for he will roar, and the children shall hasten together from the west;
028	HOS	011	011	They shall hasten together as birds out of Egypt, and as doves out of the land of Assyria: and I will cause them to dwell in their houses, saith the Lord.
028	HOS	011	012	With lies hath Ephraim encompassed me about, and with deceit, the house of Israel; but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful to the Holy One.
028	HOS	012	001	Ephraim feedeth on wind, and pursueth the east wind; the whole day he increaseth deceit and corruption; and a covenant do they make with Assyria, and oil is carried into Egypt.
028	HOS	012	002	But with Judah also hath the Lord [to hold] a controversy; and to punish Jacob according to his ways, according to his doings will he recompense him.
028	HOS	012	003	In the womb he took his brother by the heel, and in his strength he strove with an angel.
028	HOS	012	004	Yea, he strove with an angel, and prevailed; he wept, and made supplication unto him: in Beth-el he should find him, and there he will speak with us.
028	HOS	012	005	And the Lord God of hosts, the Eternal One is his memorial.
028	HOS	012	006	Therefore do thou return to thy God: keep goodness and justice, and wait on thy God continually.
028	HOS	012	007	But like a merchant, who hath the balances of deceit in his hand, loving to overreach,
028	HOS	012	008	Did Ephraim say, I am certainly become rich, I have acquired substance unto myself: it is all through my labors; they will find no iniquity in me, that could be sin.
028	HOS	012	009	And I am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt: I will yet make thee dwell in tents, as in the days of antiquity.
028	HOS	012	010	And I have spoken through the prophets, and I myself have multiplied visions, and by the means of the prophets have I spoken in similitudes.
028	HOS	012	011	If in Gil'ad there was misfortune, [it is because] there was naught but idolatry; in Gilgal they sacrificed bullocks [to idols]: their altars also are as stone-heaps on the furrows of the fields.
028	HOS	012	012	And Jacob fled into the fields of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept [the flocks].
028	HOS	012	013	And by a prophet did the Lord bring Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he guarded.
028	HOS	012	014	[Yet] Ephraim provoked [him] to anger most bitterly: therefore will his Lord cast his blood-guiltiness upon him, and his reproach will he recompense unto him.
028	HOS	013	001	When once Ephraim spoke, [all] trembled, so high was he exalted in Israel; but he offended through Ba'al, and he died.
028	HOS	013	002	And now they yet continue to sin, and have made themselves molten images of their silver, idols according to their own imagining, every one of them the work of the artisan: they say to them, They that sacrifice men may kiss the calves.
028	HOS	013	003	Therefore shall they be as the morning cloud, and as the dew that early passeth away, as the chaff that is driven by the whirlwind out of the threshing-floor, and as smoke out of a window.
028	HOS	013	004	Yet I am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt: and no god but me shalt thou know, and there is no saviour beside me.
028	HOS	013	005	I myself did provide for thee in the wilderness, in the land of great drought.
028	HOS	013	006	When they came to their pasture, they became sated; they were sated, and their heart was lifted up: therefore have they forgotten me.
028	HOS	013	007	And now I will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard will I lie in wait by the way.
028	HOS	013	008	I will meet them as a bear bereaved of her whelps, and I will rend their closed-up heart; and I will devour them there like a lioness, the beasts of the field shall rend them.
028	HOS	013	009	Thou hast destroyed thyself, O Israel; for against me, against thy helper [didst thou rebel.]
028	HOS	013	010	Where then is now thy king, that he may save thee in all thy cities? and thy judges, since thou saidst, Give me a king, and princes?
028	HOS	013	011	I give thee a king in my anger, and take him away in my wrath.
028	HOS	013	012	Bound up is the iniquity of Ephraim, treasured up is his sin.
028	HOS	013	013	The pains of a travailing woman shall come upon him; he is an unwise son; for he will not remain steadfast at the time of the breaking forth of the child.
028	HOS	013	014	From the power of the grave would I ransom them, from death would I redeem them; [but now] where are thy plagues, O death, where is thy pestilence, O grave? compassion shall be hidden from my eyes.
028	HOS	013	015	Though he grow luxuriantly in the green meadows, the east wind shall come, the wind of the Lord, rising up from the wilderness, and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up: the same shall plunder the treasure of all precious vessels.
028	HOS	013	016	Samaria shall meet her punishment; for she hath rebelled against her God: by the sword shall they fall; their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their pregnant women shall be ripped up.
028	HOS	014	001	Return, O Israel, even unto the Lord thy God; for thou hast stumbled through thy iniquity.
028	HOS	014	002	Take with you swords, and return to the Lord: say unto him, “Pardon all [our] iniquity, and accept [our return to] good; and let us repay the steers [of sacrifice] with [the prayer of] our lips.
028	HOS	014	003	Asshur shall not help us; upon horses will we not ride: and we will no more say, Ye are our gods, to the work of our hands; for in thee alone the fatherless obtaineth mercy.”
028	HOS	014	004	I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely; for my anger is turned away from them.
028	HOS	014	005	I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall bloom as the lily; and he shall strike his roots as [the forests of] Lebanon.
028	HOS	014	006	His suckers shall spread out, and his beauty shall be as that of the olive-tree, and his smell as that of the Lebanon.
028	HOS	014	007	They shall return that sat under his shade; they shall revive as corn, and bloom as the vine: the scent of which shall be as that of the wine of Lebanon.
028	HOS	014	008	Ephraim [shall say], What have I to do any more with idols? I have answered, and will observe him; I will be [to him] like a green fir-tree; through me is thy fruit found.
028	HOS	014	009	Who is wise, that he may understand these things? intelligent, that he may know them? for righteous are the ways of the Lord; and the just shall walk in them; but the transgressors will stumble through them.

# BOOK	029	JOE	Joel	Joel
029	JOE	001	001	The word of the Lord that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.
029	JOE	001	002	Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. Did ever such a thing as this come to pass in your days, or ever in the days of your fathers?
029	JOE	001	003	Tell ye of it to your children, and let your children tell it to their children, and their children to another generation.
029	JOE	001	004	What the caterpillar left hath the locust eaten; and what the locust left hath the cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm left hath the cricket eaten.
029	JOE	001	005	Wake up, ye drunkards, and weep; and wail, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the sweet new wine, that it is taken away from your mouth.
029	JOE	001	006	For a nation is come up over my land, strong, and without number; its teeth are the teeth of a lion, and it hath the cutting-teeth of the lioness.
029	JOE	001	007	It hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig-tree: it hath peeled it clean bare, and cast it down; made white are its light branches.
029	JOE	001	008	Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the betrothed of her youth.
029	JOE	001	009	Cut off are the meat-offering and the drink-offering from the house of the Lord: now mourn the priests, the ministers of the Lord.
029	JOE	001	010	Wasted is the field, the land mourneth; for wasted is the corn: dried up is the new wine, withered is the oil.
029	JOE	001	011	Be ashamed, O ye husbandmen; wail, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; because lost is the harvest of the field.
029	JOE	001	012	The vine is made ashamed, and the fig-tree is withered; the pomegranate-tree, the palm-tree also, and the apple-tree, even all the trees of the field, are dried up; because joy hath ceased from the children of men.
029	JOE	001	013	Gird yourselves [with sackcloth], and lament, ye priests; wail, ye ministers of the altar: come, remain all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God; for there are withholden from the house of your God the meat-offering and the drink-offering.
029	JOE	001	014	Sanctify ye a fast, proclaim a solemn assembly, gather the elders, all the inhabitants of the land, into the house of the Lord your God, and cry aloud unto the Lord.
029	JOE	001	015	Alas for the day! for the day of the Lord is at hand, and like destruction from the Almighty will it come.
029	JOE	001	016	Is not before our eyes the food cut off, from the house of our God joy and gladness?
029	JOE	001	017	The grains of seed are rotten under their clods, laid desolate are the garners, pulled down are the barns; for the corn is dried up.
029	JOE	001	018	How do the beasts groan! how do the herds of cattle roam about; because there is no pasture for them: yea, the flocks of sheep are made to perish.
029	JOE	001	019	To thee O Lord, will I cry; for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath singed all the trees of the field.
029	JOE	001	020	Also the beasts of the field cry unto thee panting; for the brooks of waters are dried up, and a fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.
029	JOE	002	001	Blow ye the cornet in Zion, and sound an alarm on my holy mount; let all the inhabitants of the land tremble; for the day of the Lord cometh, for it is nigh;
029	JOE	002	002	It is a day of darkness and of gloom, a day of clouds and of tempestuous obscurity, like the morning-dawn spread out upon the mountains: a people numerous and strong, the like of which hath never been and after it there will be none any more, even to the years of all coming generations.
029	JOE	002	003	Before it devoureth a fire; and behind it singeth a flame: like the garden of 'Eden was the land before it [came], and after it is a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing escapeth from it.
029	JOE	002	004	Like the appearance of horses is its appearance; and like horsemen, so do they run.
029	JOE	002	005	Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains do they leap; they are like the noise of a flame of fire consuming the stubble, as a strong people arrayed for a battle.
029	JOE	002	006	At its presence the people are much pained: all the faces are covered with blackness.
029	JOE	002	007	Like mighty men do they run; like men of war they climb up a wall; and they march every one on his own ways, and they turn not aside on their paths.
029	JOE	002	008	And they do not press one another; every one on his beaten track do they go forward: and they pass through between war-like weapons, and change not their purpose.
029	JOE	002	009	Into the city they hasten forward; on the wall they run; into the houses they climb up; through the windows they make their entrance like a thief.
029	JOE	002	010	Before them trembleth the earth; the heavens quake; the sun and the moon are obscured, and the stars withdraw their brightness.
029	JOE	002	011	And the Lord uttereth his voice before his army; for very numerous is his camp; for strong is he that executeth his word; for great is the day of the Lord and very terrible; and who is able to endure it?
029	JOE	002	012	But even now also, saith the Lord, return ye fully to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:
029	JOE	002	013	And rend your heart, and not your garments, and return unto the Lord your God; for gracious and merciful is he, long suffering, and of great kindness, and he bethinketh himself of the evil.
029	JOE	002	014	He that is conscious [of guilt], let him return and repent: when [the plague] may leave behind it a blessing; even a meat-offering and a drink-offering unto the Lord your God.
029	JOE	002	015	Blow the cornet in Zion, sanctify a fast, proclaim a solemn assembly;
029	JOE	002	016	Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts; let the bridegroom go forth out of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.
029	JOE	002	017	Between the porch and the altar let the priests weep, the ministers of the Lord, and let them say, Spare, O Lord, thy people, and give not up thy heritage to reproach, for nations to make a by-word of them: wherefore should they say among the people, Where is their God?
029	JOE	002	018	And the Lord was zealous for his land, and he had pity for his people.
029	JOE	002	019	And the Lord answered and said unto his people, “Behold, I will send you the corn, and the young wine, and the oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith; and I will not give you up any more to be a reproach among the nations:
029	JOE	002	020	And the host of the north will I remove far away from you, and I will drive it off into a land barren and desolate, with its advance toward the eastern sea, and its rereward toward the western sea; and its stench shall ascend, and its ill savor shall come up, because it hath done great things.”
029	JOE	002	021	Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice; for the Lord hath done great things.
029	JOE	002	022	Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field; for the pastures of the wilderness have become green; for the tree beareth its fruit, the fig-tree and the vine yield their strength.
029	JOE	002	023	And ye children of Zion, be glad, and rejoice in the Lord your God; for he hath given you the first rain in beneficence, and he hath caused to come down for you the rain, the first rain, and the latter rain in the first [month].
029	JOE	002	024	And the threshing-floors are full of corn, and the vats overflow with young wine and oil.
029	JOE	002	025	And I will repay to you the years [in] which the locust hath eaten [all], with the cankerworm, and the cricket, and the caterpillar, my great army, which I had sent against you.
029	JOE	002	026	And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name of the Lord your God, who hath dealt wondrously with you: and my people shall not be made ashamed unto eternity.
029	JOE	002	027	And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the Lord your God, and none else; and my people shall not be made ashamed unto eternity.
029	JOE	002	028	And it shall come to pass after this, that I will pour out my spirit over all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy: your old men shall dream dreams: your young men shall see visions:
029	JOE	002	029	And also over the men-servants and over the maid-servants in those days will I pour out my spirit.
029	JOE	002	030	And I will display wonderful tokens in the heavens and on the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.
029	JOE	002	031	The sun shall be changed into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the coming of the day of the Lord, the great and the terrible.
029	JOE	002	032	And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall escape; for on mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be deliverance, as the Lord hath said, and among the remnant whom the Lord calleth.
029	JOE	003	001	For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I will cause to return the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,
029	JOE	003	002	Then will I assemble all the nations, and I will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and I will hold judgment with them there because of my people and my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and for my land [which] they have divided out.
029	JOE	003	003	And for my people did they cast lots; and gave a boy for a harlot, and sold a girl for wine, and drank it.
029	JOE	003	004	And also ye, what have ye to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all ye districts of Philistia? is this the recompense which ye repay me? or do ye only commence to render me evil?— swiftly and speedily will I bring back your recompense upon your own head;
029	JOE	003	005	Because my silver and my gold have ye taken, and the handsomest of my precious things have ye carried into your temples;
029	JOE	003	006	And the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the sons of the Jevanim, in order to remove them far from their borders.
029	JOE	003	007	Behold, I will awaken them out of the place whither ye have sold them, and I will bring back your recompense upon your own head;
029	JOE	003	008	And I will deliver your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a nation far off; for the Lord hath spoken it.
029	JOE	003	009	Proclaim ye this among the nations, Prepare war, wake up the mighty men; let them draw near; let them come up—all the men of war.
029	JOE	003	010	Beat your plough-shares into swords, and your pruning-knives into spears: let the weak say, I am a hero.
029	JOE	003	011	Assemble hastily together, and come, all ye nations from every side, and gather yourselves together: there doth the Lord strike down thy mighty ones.
029	JOE	003	012	Let the nations awake, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat; for there will I sit to judge all the nations from every side.
029	JOE	003	013	Put forth the sickle; for the harvest is ripe: come, tread down [the grapes]; for the press is full; the vats overflow; for great is their wickedness.
029	JOE	003	014	Multitudes, multitudes are in the valley of decision; for near is the day of the Lord in the valley of decision.
029	JOE	003	015	Sun and moon are obscured, and stars withdraw their brightness.
029	JOE	003	016	And the Lord will cry aloud out of Zion, and from Jerusalem will he send forth his voice; and the heavens and the earth shall quake; but the Lord will be a refuge for his people, and a stronghold for the children of Israel.
029	JOE	003	017	So shall ye know that I am the Lord your God, dwelling on Zion, my holy mount: and Jerusalem shall be holy, and strangers shall not pass through her any more.
029	JOE	003	018	And it came to pass on that day, that the mountains shall drop down sweet new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the ravines of Judah shall flow with water; and a spring shall come forth out of the house of the Lord, and shall water the valley of Shittim.
029	JOE	003	019	Egypt shall become a desolate land, and Edom shall become a desolate wilderness; because of the violence against the children of Judah, in whose land they have shed innocent blood.
029	JOE	003	020	But Judah shall be inhabited for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.
029	JOE	003	021	And I will avenge their blood that I have not yet avenged; for the Lord dwelleth in Zion.

# BOOK	030	AMO	Amos	Amos
030	AMO	001	001	The words of 'Amos, who was among the herdmen of Tekoa, which he foresaw concerning Israel in the days of 'Uzziyah the king of Judah, and in the days of Jerobo'am the son of Joash the king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.
030	AMO	001	002	And he said, The Lord will cry aloud out of Zion, and from Jerusalem will he send forth his voice; and then shall mourn the pastures of the shepherds, and then shall dry up the top of Carmel.
030	AMO	001	003	Thus hath said the Lord, For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, will I not turn away their punishment; because they have threshed [the inhabitants of] Gil'ad with threshing instruments of iron;
030	AMO	001	004	And I will send a fire into the house of Chazael, which shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad.
030	AMO	001	005	And I will break the bars of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitants from the valley of Aven, and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of 'Eden: and the people of Syria shall be exiled unto Kir, saith the Lord.
030	AMO	001	006	Thus hath said the Lord, For three transgressions of Gazzah, and for four, will I not turn away their punishment; because they carried away exiles in full numbers, to deliver them up to Edom;
030	AMO	001	007	And I will send a fire against the wall of Gazzah, which shall devour her palaces;
030	AMO	001	008	And I will cut off the inhabitants from Ashdod, and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon, and I will turn my hand against 'Ekron: and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, saith the Lord Eternal.
030	AMO	001	009	Thus hath said the Lord, For three transgressions of Tyre, and for four, will I not turn away their punishment; because they delivered up the exiles in full numbers to Edom, and remembered not the brotherly covenant;
030	AMO	001	010	And I will send a fire against the walls of Tyre, which shall devour her palaces.
030	AMO	001	011	Thus hath said the Lord, For three transgressions of Edom, and for four, will I not turn away their punishment; because he pursued with the sword his brother, and disregarded his mercy, and his anger tore in pieces continually, and he kept his wrath for ever:
030	AMO	001	012	And I will send out a fire against Theman, which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.
030	AMO	001	013	Thus hath said the Lord, For three transgressions of the children of 'Ammon, and for four, will I not turn away their punishment; because they have ripped up the pregnant women of Gil'ad, in order to enlarge their own territory;
030	AMO	001	014	And I will kindle a fire within the walls of Rabbah, which shall devour her palaces, with shouting on the day of battle, with a storm on the day of the tempest;
030	AMO	001	015	And their king shall go into exile, he and his princes together, saith the Lord.
030	AMO	002	001	Thus hath said the Lord, For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, will I not turn away their punishment; because he burnt the bones of the king of Edom into lime;
030	AMO	002	002	And I will send a fire against Moab, which shall devour the palaces of Keriyoth: and Moab shall die in the tumult, in the shouting, amidst the sound of the cornet;
030	AMO	002	003	And I will cut off the judges from her midst, and all her princes will I slay, with him, saith the Lord.
030	AMO	002	004	Thus hath said the Lord, For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, will I not turn away their punishment; because they have despised the law of the Lord, and did not keep his statutes, and their lying idols caused them to err, after which their fathers had walked;
030	AMO	002	005	And I will send out a fire against Judah, which shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.
030	AMO	002	006	Thus hath said the Lord, For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, will I not turn away their punishment; because they sold for silver the righteous, and the needy for a pair of shoes;
030	AMO	002	007	That are eager after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto the same young woman, in order to profane my holy name.
030	AMO	002	008	And upon pledged garments they stretch themselves out by every altar, and the wine of the condemned do they drink in the house of their gods.
030	AMO	002	009	Yet have I destroyed the Emorite from before them, whose height was like the height of cedars, and who was strong as the oaks; but I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.
030	AMO	002	010	And it was I who have brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you forty years through the wilderness, to take possession of the land of the Emorite.
030	AMO	002	011	And I have raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for nazarites: is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the Lord.
030	AMO	002	012	But ye have given the nazarites wine to drink; and concerning the prophets have ye commanded, saying, Ye shall not prophesy.
030	AMO	002	013	Behold, I press down [the ground] under you, as the wagon presseth [it] down that is full of sheaves.
030	AMO	002	014	And refuge shall vanish from the swift, and the strong shall not make use of his force, neither shall the mighty man escape with his life.
030	AMO	002	015	And he that handleth the bow shall not be able to stand; and he that is swift of foot shall not escape: neither shall he that rideth the horse escape with his life.
030	AMO	002	016	And he that is most courageous hearted among the mighty shall flee away naked on that day, saith the Lord.
030	AMO	003	001	Hear this word which the Lord hath spoken concerning you, O children of Israel, concerning the whole family which I have brought up from the land of Egypt, saying,
030	AMO	003	002	Only you have I loved out of all the families of the earth: therefore will I visit upon you all your iniquities.
030	AMO	003	003	Will two walk together, except they had agreed [to do so]?
030	AMO	003	004	Will a lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey? will a young lion send forth his voice out of his den, unless he have caught something?
030	AMO	003	005	Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, when there is no gin for him? is ever a snare taken up from the ground, when it hath caught nothing at all?
030	AMO	003	006	Shall a cornet be blown in a city, and the people not become afraid? shall there be evil in a city, and the Lord have not done it?
030	AMO	003	007	For the Lord Eternal will do nothing, unless he have revealed his secret unto his servants the prophets.
030	AMO	003	008	The lion hath roared, who will not fear? the Lord Eternal hath spoken, who will not prophesy?
030	AMO	003	009	Publish at the palaces in Ashdod, and at the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold the great confusions in her midst, and the oppressions [that are] within her.
030	AMO	003	010	For they know not how to act rightly, saith the Lord, who treasure up violence and robbery in their palaces.
030	AMO	003	011	Therefore thus hath said the Lord Eternal, The adversary [is there] and surroundeth the land: and he shall bring down from thee thy strength, and thy palaces shall be plundered.
030	AMO	003	012	Thus hath said the Lord, As the shepherd snatcheth out of the mouth of the lion [at most] two leg-bones, or a tip of the ear: so shall be delivered the children of Israel that sit in Samaria on the corner of a bed, and on Damascus couches.
030	AMO	003	013	Hear ye, and give warning in the house of Jacob, saith the Lord Eternal, the God of hosts.
030	AMO	003	014	For on the day when I visit the transgressions of Israel upon him, will I also inflict punishment on the altars of Beth-el: and then shall be hewn off the horns of the altar, and they shall fall to the ground.
030	AMO	003	015	And I will smite the winter-house together with the summer-house: and the houses of ivory shall disappear, and the great houses shall be no more, saith the Lord.
030	AMO	004	001	Hear this word, O ye cows of Bashan, that are on the mount of Samaria, who oppress the poor, who crush the needy, who say to their lords, Bring, and let us drink.
030	AMO	004	002	Sworn hath the Lord Eternal by his holiness, that, lo, days are coming over you, when men will carry you away with hooks, and your posterity with fishhooks.
030	AMO	004	003	And through breaches in the wall shall ye go out, every one through that before her: and ye shall cast off your proud greatness, saith the Lord.
030	AMO	004	004	Go then to Beth-el, and transgress; to Gilgal, [and] multiply transgression; and bring in the morning your sacrifices, after three days your tithes:
030	AMO	004	005	And burn of leaven a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and proclaim and publish freewill-offerings; for so do you love [to do], O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord Eternal.
030	AMO	004	006	But, I also had indeed given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places: and yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the Lord.
030	AMO	004	007	And I also had indeed withholden from you the rain, when it was yet three months to the harvest; and I caused it to rain upon one city, and upon another city I caused it not to rain; one piece of land was rained upon, and another piece whereupon it rained not became dried up;
030	AMO	004	008	And two or three cities wandered unto one city, to drink water; but they were not satisfied: and yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the Lord.
030	AMO	004	009	I had smitten you with blasting and mildew; the multitude of your gardens and your vineyards and your fig-trees and your olive-trees did the caterpillar devour: and yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the Lord.
030	AMO	004	010	I had sent out against you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt; I slew your young men with the sword, together with your captive horses; and I had caused the stench of your camps to ascend even into your nostrils; and yet ye have not returned unto me, saith the Lord.
030	AMO	004	011	I had produced an overthrow among you, like the overthrow by God of Sodom and Gomorrah, and ye became like a fire-brand snatched out of the burning: and yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the Lord.
030	AMO	004	012	Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel: because then I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.
030	AMO	004	013	For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man what is his thought, that maketh the morning-dawn [and] darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth, — The Lord, the God of hosts, is his name.
030	AMO	005	001	Hear ye this word which I take up against you, as a lamentation, O house of Israel.
030	AMO	005	002	She is fallen, she will not rise again—the virgin of Israel: she is thrown down upon her land; there is none to raise her up.
030	AMO	005	003	For thus hath said the Lord Eternal, The city that goeth forth with a thousand shall retain but a hundred, and she that goeth forth with a hundred shall retain but ten, [left] to the house of Israel.
030	AMO	005	004	For thus hath said the Lord unto the house of Israel, Seek ye for me, and ye shall live;
030	AMO	005	005	But seek not for Beth-el, and into Gilgal enter not, and to Beer-sheba' do not pass over; for Gilgal shall surely go into exile, and Beth-el shall become naught.
030	AMO	005	006	Seek for the Lord, and ye shall live: so that he come not suddenly like fire over the house of Joseph, and it devour, and there be none to quench it in Beth-el;
030	AMO	005	007	Ye who change justice into wormwood, and cast down righteousness to the earth!
030	AMO	005	008	[But] he maketh the seven stars and Orion, and changeth into morning the shadow of death, and maketh the day dark into night; he it is that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out over the face of the earth: The Lord is his name;
030	AMO	005	009	That causeth wasting to prevail against the strong, so that wasting shall come against the fortress.
030	AMO	005	010	They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and him that speaketh uprightly they abhor.
030	AMO	005	011	Therefore forasmuch as you tread down upon the poor, and ye take from him onerous contributions of corn: if ye have built houses of hewn stone, ye shall not dwell in them; if ye have planted pleasant vineyards, ye shall not drink their wine.
030	AMO	005	012	For I know your manifold transgressions and your numerous sins: ye are those that are the adversaries of the just, that take a ransom, and that wrest [the cause of] the needy in the gate.
030	AMO	005	013	Therefore will the intelligent keep silence in that time; for it is an evil time.
030	AMO	005	014	Seek for the good, and not the evil, in order that ye may live: and so will the Lord, the God of hosts, be with you, as ye have said.
030	AMO	005	015	Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish justice firmly in the gate: perhaps the Lord the God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.
030	AMO	005	016	Therefore thus hath said the Eternal, the God of hosts, the Lord, On all public places there is lamentation, and in all the streets they cry, Woe! woe! and they call the husbandman to mourning, and to lamentation those skilled in wailing.
030	AMO	005	017	And in all vineyards there is lamentation; for I will pass through thy midst, saith the Lord.
030	AMO	005	018	Woe unto you that long for the day of the Lord! for what do you wish the day of the Lord? it is [one of] darkness, and not of light.
030	AMO	005	019	As if a man were to flee from a lion, and a bear should meet him; and he enter into the house, and lean his hand against the wall, and a serpent should bite him.
030	AMO	005	020	Behold the day of the Lord is [one of] darkness, and not of light; yea, it is obscure, and hath no brightness.
030	AMO	005	021	I hate, I despise your feast-days, and I will not smell [the sacrifices] on your festive assemblies.
030	AMO	005	022	For though ye should offer me burnt-offerings and your meat-offerings, I will not accept them in favor: and the peace-offerings of your fatted cattle will I not look at.
030	AMO	005	023	Remove thou from around me the noise of thy songs: and the playing of thy psalteries I will not hear.
030	AMO	005	024	But let justice roll along like water, and righteousness like a mighty stream.
030	AMO	005	025	Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and meat-offerings in the wilderness [during] forty years, O house of Israel?
030	AMO	005	026	Bear then the canopy of your chief idol, and the figure of your images, the star of your god, which ye have made for yourselves.
030	AMO	005	027	And I will cause you to go into exile far beyond Damascus, saith the Lord, The God of hosts is his name.
030	AMO	006	001	Woe to those that are free from care in Zion, and that are in safety on the mount of Samaria, who are named the chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel come!
030	AMO	006	002	Pass ye over unto Calneh, and see; and go from there to Chamath-rabbah; then go down to Gath of the Philistines: whether they be better than these kingdoms? or whether their territory be greater than your territory?
030	AMO	006	003	[Ye] that deem far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near;
030	AMO	006	004	That lie upon beds of ivory, and are stretched out upon their couches, and eat lambs out of the flock, and calves out of the midst of the stall;
030	AMO	006	005	That chant to the sound of the psaltery, and like David's do they imagine their instrument of music to be;
030	AMO	006	006	That drink out of wine-bowls, and anoint themselves with the costliest of ointments; but who feel no pain for the wound of Joseph.
030	AMO	006	007	Therefore now shall they go into exile at the head of exiles, and the noisy banquet of those that were stretched out shall pass away.
030	AMO	006	008	The Lord Eternal hath sworn by his own existence, saith the Lord the God of hosts, I abhor the pride of Jacob, and his palaces do I hate: therefore will I surrender up [to the enemy] the city with all that filleth it.
030	AMO	006	009	And it shall come to pass, that if there remain ten men in one house, they shall die.
030	AMO	006	010	And should a man's uncle or relative carry him forth, to bring out the bones out of the house, and say unto him that is in the recesses of the house, Is there yet any one with thee? he will say, There is no one left. Then will he say, Be silent; for we may not make mention of the name of the Lord.
030	AMO	006	011	For, behold, the Lord commandeth, and he will smite the great house with breaches, and the little house with clefts.
030	AMO	006	012	Do horses ever run upon the rock? or will one plough there with oxen? that ye have turned justice into poison, and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood;
030	AMO	006	013	Ye who rejoice for a thing of naught, who say, Have we not through our own strength procured ourselves horns?
030	AMO	006	014	For, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, saith the Lord the God of hosts, and they shall oppress you from the entrance of Chamath unto the brook of the wilderness.
030	AMO	007	001	Thus did the Lord Eternal show unto me: and, behold, he was forming locusts in the beginning of the sprouting up of the latter groweth; and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king's mowings [was over].
030	AMO	007	002	And it came to pass, when they had made an end of eating up the herbs of the earth, that I said, O Lord Eternal, forgive, I beseech thee: how should Jacob be able to endure, since he is so small!
030	AMO	007	003	The Lord bethought himself of this: It shall not be, said the Lord.
030	AMO	007	004	Thus did the Lord Eternal show unto me: and, behold, the Lord Eternal called forth the punishment by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and consumed the ploughed field.
030	AMO	007	005	Then said I, O Lord Eternal, forbear, I beseech thee: how should Jacob be able to endure, since he is so small!
030	AMO	007	006	The Lord bethought himself of this: Also this shall not be, said the Lord Eternal.
030	AMO	007	007	Thus he showed unto me: and, behold, the Lord was standing upon a wall [made] by a plumbline, and in his hand was a plumbline.
030	AMO	007	008	And the Lord said unto me, What dost thou see, 'Amos? And I said, A plumbline. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel; I will not farther indulge them any more.
030	AMO	007	009	And the high places of Isaac shall be made desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid in ruins: and I will rise up against the house of Jerobo'am with the sword.
030	AMO	007	010	Then sent Amazyah, the priest of Beth-el, to Jerobo'am the king of Israel, saying, 'Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.
030	AMO	007	011	For thus hath 'Amos said, By the sword shall Jerobo'am die, and Israel shall surely be led away into exile out of their own land.
030	AMO	007	012	And Amazyah said unto 'Amos, Seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and eat there [thy] bread, and there prophesy;
030	AMO	007	013	But at Beth-el prophesy not farther any more; for it is the king's sanctuary, and it is a royal residence.
030	AMO	007	014	Then answered 'Amos, and said to Amazyah, I am no prophet, nor am I a prophet's son; but I am a herdman, and a gatherer of wild figs;
030	AMO	007	015	But the Lord hath taken me away from behind the flocks, and the Lord said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.
030	AMO	007	016	And now hear thou the word of the Lord, Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and preach not against the house of Isaac.
030	AMO	007	017	Therefore thus hath said the Lord, Thy wife will play the harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided out by the line; and thou shalt die in an unclean land; and Israel shall surely be led forth into exile out of their land.
030	AMO	008	001	Thus did the Lord Eternal show unto me: and, behold, there was a basket of summer fruit.
030	AMO	008	002	And he said, What dost thou see, 'Amos? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then said the Lord unto me, The end is come for my people Israel: I will not farther indulge them any more.
030	AMO	008	003	And the songs of the temple shall become a wailing on that day, saith the Lord Eternal: many shall be the dead bodies; in every place shall men throw them down, [saying,] Be silent.
030	AMO	008	004	Hear this, O ye that are greedy to swallow the needy, and to ruin the poor of the land,
030	AMO	008	005	Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell provision? and the sabbath, that we may open the corn-warehouses, making the ephah small, and increasing the shekel, and cheating with deceitful balances?
030	AMO	008	006	That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes; and even sell the refuse of the corn?
030	AMO	008	007	Sworn hath the Lord by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will not forget to eternity all their works.
030	AMO	008	008	Shall because of this the land not tremble, and mourn every one that dwelleth therein? and shall it not rise up like a stream wholly, and roll onward and sink again like the stream of Egypt?
030	AMO	008	009	And it shall come to pass on that day, saith the Lord Eternal, that I will cause the sun to set at noon, and I will bring darkness over the earth on a bright day;
030	AMO	008	010	And I will change your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentations; and I will bring upon all loins sackcloth, and upon every head baldness; and I will cause [the land] to mourn as one doth for an only son, and its end to be as a day of bitter [complaint].
030	AMO	008	011	Behold, days are coming, saith the Lord Eternal, when I will send a famine in the land, not a famine for bread, nor a thirst for water, but to hear the words of the Lord:
030	AMO	008	012	And they will wander about from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they will roam about to seek the word of the Lord; but they shall not find it.
030	AMO	008	013	On that day shall the fair virgins and the young men faint for thirst;
030	AMO	008	014	Those that swear by the guilt of Samaria, and say, As thy god liveth, O Dan; and, As liveth the worshipped idol of Beer-sheba', —yea, they shall fall, and never rise up again.
030	AMO	009	001	I saw the Lord standing upon the altar; and he said, Smite the capital, that the sills may quake; and break them in pieces over the head of all of them; and their posterity will I slay with the sword: there shall not flee away from them one that fleeth, and there shall not escape from them one that is saved.
030	AMO	009	002	Though they were to creep down into the nether world, thence would my hand fetch them; and though they were to climb up to the heavens, thence would I bring them down;
030	AMO	009	003	And though they were to hide themselves on the top of Carmel, thence would I search and take them out; and though they were to conceal themselves from before my eyes in the bottom of the sea, thence would I command the serpent, that he should bite them;
030	AMO	009	004	And though they were to go into captivity before their enemies, thence would I command the sword, that it should slay them: and I will set my eye upon them for evil, and not for good.
030	AMO	009	005	And the Lord Eternal of hosts it is that toucheth the earth, and she melteth away, and all that dwell thereon shall mourn; and she riseth up like a stream wholly; and she sinketh like the stream of Egypt;
030	AMO	009	006	That buildeth in the heavens his steps, and hath founded his vault over the earth; that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out over the face of the earth: The Lord is his name.
030	AMO	009	007	Are ye not like the children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel? saith the Lord: have I not brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?
030	AMO	009	008	Behold, the eyes of the Lord Eternal are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; save only that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the Lord.
030	AMO	009	009	For, lo, I will give the command, and I will shake about among all the nations the house of Israel, as one shaketh things in a sieve, while not the least piece falleth down upon the earth.
030	AMO	009	010	By the sword shall die all the sinners of my people, who say, The evil will not come near [us], nor hasten along for our sake.
030	AMO	009	011	On that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David which is fallen; and I will close up its breaches; and its ruins will I raise up, and I will rebuild it as in days of old:
030	AMO	009	012	In order that they may take possession of the remnant of Edom, and of all the nations, which are called by my name, saith the Lord that doth this.
030	AMO	009	013	Behold, days are coming, saith the Lord, when the ploughman shall come close up to the harvester, and the treader of the grapes to the one that scattereth the seed: and the mountains shall drop with sweet new wine, and all the hills shall melt away.
030	AMO	009	014	And I will bring back the captivity of my people Israel, and they shall build the wasted cities, and dwell therein; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink their wine; and they shall lay out gardens, and eat their fruit.
030	AMO	009	015	And I will plant them upon their own soil, and they shall not be pulled up any more out of their land which I have given unto them, saith the Lord thy God.

031	OBA	001	001	The vision of 'Obadiah: Thus hath said the Lord Eternal concerning Edom, A rumor have we heard from the Lord, and an ambassador is sent among the nations, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her to war.
031	OBA	001	002	Behold, I make thee small among the nations: thou shalt be greatly despised.
031	OBA	001	003	The presumption of thy heart hath beguiled thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?
031	OBA	001	004	Though thou wert to rise as high as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the Lord.
031	OBA	001	005	How? are thieves come to thee? or night-prowling robbers? how destroyed art thou! would they not have stolen till they had enough? if grape-gatherers had come to thee, would they not have left some gleanings?
031	OBA	001	006	How are [the treasures] of Esau searched out! how are his hidden things laid open!
031	OBA	001	007	Up to the border have accompanied thee all the men of thy confederacy; beguiled, overcome thee have the men that were at peace with thee: [they that eat] thy bread have struck thee secretly a wound. There is no understanding in him.
031	OBA	001	008	Shall I not on that same day, saith the Lord, even destroy the wise men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?
031	OBA	001	009	And thy mighty men, O Theman, shall be dismayed, in order that every one from the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter.
031	OBA	001	010	Because of thy violence against thy brother Jacob shall shame cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.
031	OBA	001	011	On the day that thou stoodest on the other side, on the day that strangers carried away captive his army, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots over Jerusalem, also thou wast as any one of them.
031	OBA	001	012	But thou shouldst not have looked on [pleased] at the day of thy brother, on the day that he was delivered up to strangers; neither shouldst thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah on the day of their destruction; nor should thou have spoken proudly on the day of distress.
031	OBA	001	013	Thou shouldst not have entered into the gate of my people on the day of their calamity; yea, thou too shouldst not have looked [pleased] on their affliction on the day of their calamity; nor have laid hands on their army on the day of their calamity;
031	OBA	001	014	Neither shouldst thou have stood in the crossway, to cut off those of his that did escape; neither shouldst thou have delivered up those of his that did remain on the day of distress.
031	OBA	001	015	For near is the day of the Lord over all the nations: as thou hast done, shall it be done unto thee; thy deeds shall return upon thy own head.
031	OBA	001	016	For as ye have drunk upon my holy mount, so shall all the nations drink continually; yea, they shall drink, and they shall reel about, and they shall be as though they had not been.
031	OBA	001	017	But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and it shall be holy: and the house of Jacob shall again possess their inheritances.
031	OBA	001	018	And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau become stubble, and they shall set them on fire, and devour them; and there shall not be any one remaining of the house of Esau; for the Lord hath spoken it.
031	OBA	001	019	And they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau; and they of the lowlands, the Philistines; and they shall possess the fields of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin [shall possess] Gil'ad.
031	OBA	001	020	And the exiles of this host of the children of Israel that are [with] the Canaanites, as far as Zarephath, and the exiles of Jerusalem, who are in Sepharad, shall possess the cities of the south.
031	OBA	001	021	And deliverers shall go up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau: and the kingdom shall be the Lord's

# BOOK	032	JON	Jonah	Jonah
032	JON	001	001	The word of the Lord also came unto Jonah the son of 'Amitthai, saying,
032	JON	001	002	Arise, Go unto Nineveh, the great city, and proclaim against her; for their wickedness is come up before me.
032	JON	001	003	But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tharshish from the presence of the Lord; and he went down to Joppa, and found a ship going to Tharshish, and paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tharshish, from the presence of the Lord.
032	JON	001	004	But the Lord excited a great wind upon the sea, and there was a mighty tempest on the sea; and it was thought that the ship would be broken in pieces.
032	JON	001	005	And the mariners were afraid, and called every man unto his god; and they cast forth the articles which were in the ship into the sea, to be lightened of them. But Jonah was gone down into the hold of the ship, and lay down, and was fast asleep.
032	JON	001	006	So the ship-master came near unto him, and said unto him, Why dost thou sleep? arise, call upon thy God: perhaps it be that God will think of us, that we may not be lost.
032	JON	001	007	And they said one to the other, Come, and let us cast lots; that we may know for whose cause this evil hath happened unto us. And they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.
032	JON	001	008	Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, thou for whose cause this evil hath happened unto us, What is thy business? and whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou?
032	JON	001	009	And he said unto them, I am a Hebrew; and I fear the Lord, the God of heaven, who hath made the sea and the dry land.
032	JON	001	010	Then were the men exceedingly afraid and they said unto him, What is this thou hast done? for the men knew that he was flying from the presence of the Lord; because he had told them.
032	JON	001	011	And they said unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may become calm around us? for the sea grew more and more tempestuous.
032	JON	001	012	And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea: so shall the sea be calm around you; for I know well that because of me is this great tempest upon you.
032	JON	001	013	Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring [the ship] back to the land; but they could not; for the sea grew more and more tempestuous around them.
032	JON	001	014	And they called unto the Lord, and said, We beseech thee, O Lord, let us not be lost, we pray thee, for the life of this man, and lay not upon us [the guilt of] innocent blood; for thou art the Lord, as it pleaseth thee so dost thou do.
032	JON	001	015	And they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea ceased from its raging.
032	JON	001	016	And the men feared the Lord very greatly; and they offered a sacrifice unto the Lord, and made vows.
032	JON	001	017	And the Lord made ready a large fish to swallow up Jonah: and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.
032	JON	002	001	Then prayed Jonah unto the Lord his God out of the belly of the fish.
032	JON	002	002	And he said, I called from the midst of my distress unto the Lord, and he hath answered me: out of the depth of the grave have I cried, and thou hast heard my voice.
032	JON	002	003	For thou hast cast me into the deep, in the heart of the seas; and the stream compasseth me about: all thy billows and thy waves have passed over me.
032	JON	002	004	And I thought indeed, I am driven out from before thy eyes: yet I again shall look toward thy holy temple.
032	JON	002	005	The waters surrounded me, to the peril of my life; the deep compassed me about: sea-weeds were bound about my head.
032	JON	002	006	To the bottoms of the mountains did I go down; the earth [closed] her bars about me for ever: when thou broughtest up my life from the pit, O Lord my God!
032	JON	002	007	When my soul fainted within me I remembered the Lord: and my prayer came unto thee, unto thy holy temple.
032	JON	002	008	They that guard false vanities forsake [the source of] their kindness.
032	JON	002	009	But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; that which I have vowed will I pay; [for] help is with the Lord.
032	JON	002	010	And the Lord commanded the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.
032	JON	003	001	And the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the second time, saying,
032	JON	003	002	Arise, go unto Nineveh, the great city, and proclaim unto it the proclamation which I shall speak unto thee.
032	JON	003	003	And Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the Lord. Now Nineveh was a great city before God, a three days' journey.
032	JON	003	004	And Jonah began to go through the city one day's journey, and he called out, and said, Yet forty days more, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.
032	JON	003	005	And the men of Nineveh believed in God; and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them to the least of them.
032	JON	003	006	For when the matter was come unto the king of Nineveh, he arose from his throne, and put off his mantle from him, and covered himself with sackcloth, and sat down on ashes.
032	JON	003	007	And he caused to be proclaimed and he published through Nineveh, By the decree of the king and his chief men, it is said, Neither man nor beast, neither herds nor flocks, shall taste any thing; they shall not feed, nor drink water;
032	JON	003	008	But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and let [men] call unto God with might; and let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence which is in their hands.
032	JON	003	009	Who knoweth, but God may turn and bethink himself, and turn away from the fierceness of his anger, that we perish not?
032	JON	003	010	And God saw their works, that they had turned from their evil way: and God bethought himself of the evil, which he had spoken that he would do unto them, and he did it not.
032	JON	004	001	But it displeased Jonah exceedingly; and he was wroth.
032	JON	004	002	And he prayed unto the Lord, and said, I pray thee, O Lord, was not this my word, while I was yet in my own country? Therefore made I haste to fly unto Tharshish; for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, long-suffering, and abundant in kindness, and repentant of the evil.
032	JON	004	003	And now, O Lord, take, I pray thee, my soul from me; because it is better for me to die, than to live.
032	JON	004	004	And the Lord said, Art thou very wroth?
032	JON	004	005	Now Jonah was gone out of the city, and dwelt on the east side of the city; and he had made himself there a booth, and sat under it in the shade, till he should see what would become of the city.
032	JON	004	006	And the Lord God made ready a gourd, and it grew up over Jonah, to be a shade over his head, to relieve him from his affliction. And Jonah rejoiced because of the gourd exceedingly.
032	JON	004	007	But God made ready a worm when the morning dawned on the morrow, and it smote the gourd that it withered.
032	JON	004	008	And it came to pass, when the sun arose, that God made ready a hot east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he became faint; and he wished for himself to die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.
032	JON	004	009	And God said unto Jonah, Art thou very wroth for the gourd? And he said, I am very wroth, even unto death.
032	JON	004	010	And the Lord said, Thou wouldst have spared the gourd, for which thou hadst not labored, neither hadst thou made it grow; which came up in one night, and perished in one night;
032	JON	004	011	And shall I not spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than twelve times ten thousand persons, who know not how to discern between their right hand and their left hand, and also much cattle?

# BOOK	033	MIC	Micah	Micah
033	MIC	001	001	The word of the Lord that came to Micah the Morashthite in the days of Jotham, Achaz, [and] Hezekiah, the kings of Judah, which he foresaw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.
033	MIC	001	002	Hear, ye people, altogether; listen, O earth, with all that filleth it: and let the Lord Eternal be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.
033	MIC	001	003	For, behold, the Lord cometh forth out of his residence; and he will come down, and will step along upon the high places of the earth.
033	MIC	001	004	And the mountains shall melt beneath him, and the valleys shall cleave in twain, like wax [melteth] before the fire, like water poured out on a declivity.
033	MIC	001	005	For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. Who caused the transgression of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and who caused the high-places of Judah? is it not Jerusalem?
033	MIC	001	006	Therefore will I change Samaria into stone-heaps on the field, into vineyard plantations: and I will hurl down into the valley her stones, and her foundations will I lay open.
033	MIC	001	007	And all her graven images shall he beaten to pieces, and all her wages of sin shall be burnt with the fire, and all her idols will I make desolate; for from harlot's wages she gathered them, and for harlot's wages shall they be used again.
033	MIC	001	008	For this will I lament and wail; I will go confused and naked: I will make a lament like the crocodiles, and mourning like the ostriches.
033	MIC	001	009	For her wounds arc incurable; for [the evil] is come even unto Judah; [the enemy] hath reached as far as the gate of my people, even up to Jerusalem.
033	MIC	001	010	Tell it not at Gath, weep ye not loudly [there]: in Bethle'aphrah roll thyself in the dust.
033	MIC	001	011	Pass ye away, ye inhabitants of Shaphir, having your shame laid bare: the inhabitress of Zaanan cometh not forth [any more]; the mourning of Beth-haezel taketh from you its halting place.
033	MIC	001	012	For the inhabitress of Maroth is grieved for the [lost] good; because evil came down from the Lord unto the gate of Jerusalem.
033	MIC	001	013	Bind the chariot to the swift horses, O inhabitress of Lachish: the beginning of sin was she to the daughter of Zion; for in thee were found the transgressions of Israel.
033	MIC	001	014	Therefore shalt thou have to give presents to Moresheth-gath: the houses of Achzib shall become a deception to the kings of Israel.
033	MIC	001	015	Yet will I bring an [enemy as] heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah: as far as 'Adullam shall withdraw the glory of Israel.
033	MIC	001	016	Make thyself bald, and cut off thy hair for the children of thy delight; enlarge thy baldness like the eagle; because they are gone into exile from thee.
033	MIC	002	001	Woe to those that devise wickedness, and resolve on evil upon their couches! by the first light of the morning they execute it, if they have it in the power of their hand.
033	MIC	002	002	And they covet fields, and rob them; and houses, and take them away: so they defraud the master and his house, and the man and his heritage.
033	MIC	002	003	Therefore thus hath said the Lord, Behold, I will devise against this family an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; nor shall ye go erect; for it is an evil time.
033	MIC	002	004	On that day shall one take up a parable against you, and lament with a mournful lamentation, and say, “We are utterly wasted: the portion of my people hath he exchanged; how hath he removed it from me! instead of restoring [them to us] he divideth our fields.”
033	MIC	002	005	Therefore shalt thou have none that shall draw the [measuring] cord in [his] lot in the congregation of the Lord.
033	MIC	002	006	“Preach not;” [but] they shall preach: they shall not preach [indeed] to these, that reproach may not overtake them.
033	MIC	002	007	Shall it be said [in] the house of Jacob, Is the spirit of the Lord straightened? are these his doings? Do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?
033	MIC	002	008	But long since is my people risen up as an enemy: from the garment do you pull off the ornament; of those that pass by securely [ye make] men returned from war.
033	MIC	002	009	The wives of my people do you drive out of their delightful houses; from their children do ye take away my ornament for ever.
033	MIC	002	010	Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your resting-place; because it is polluted, it shall destroy [you], even with a grievous destruction.
033	MIC	002	011	If a man that goeth after wind and lieth with falsehood [should say], “I will preach unto thee of wine and of strong drink:” he would be a preacher for this people.
033	MIC	002	012	I will [once] surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather up the remnant of Israel; I will place them together as flocks in the fold, as droves in the midst of their pen: they shall be crowded with men.
033	MIC	002	013	The wall-breaker cometh up before them; they break in and pass through the gate, and go out by it: and their king passeth on before them, and the Lord at their head.
033	MIC	003	001	And I said, Hear, I pray you, O ye heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel! Is it not for you to know what is justice?
033	MIC	003	002	[But they are those] who hate the good, and love the evil; who tear their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;
033	MIC	003	003	Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and who crush their bones, and chop them in pieces, as that to be put in a pot, and as flesh within a caldron.
033	MIC	003	004	Then will they cry unto the Lord, but he will not hear them; and he will hide his face from them at that time, as they have committed their evil deeds.
033	MIC	003	005	Thus hath said the Lord concerning the prophets that mislead my people, who, when they have something to bite with their teeth, cry, Peace; but who prepare war against him who putteth nothing in their mouth:
033	MIC	003	006	Therefore shall the night be unto you, without a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, without divining; and the sun shall go down around the prophets, and the day shall be obscured around them.
033	MIC	003	007	Thus shall the seers be made ashamed, and the diviners be put to the blush: yea, they shall all wrap themselves up to the upper lip; for there is no answer of God.
033	MIC	003	008	But truly I am indeed full of strength by the spirit of the Lord, and [of power] of judging, and of might, to tell unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.
033	MIC	003	009	Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel, that abhor justice, and make crooked all that is straight.
033	MIC	003	010	They build up Zion with blood-guiltiness, and Jerusalem with wrong.
033	MIC	003	011	Her heads judge for bribes, and her priests teach for reward, and her prophets divine for money: and yet will they lean upon the Lord, and say, Is not the Lord among us? evil cannot come over us.
033	MIC	003	012	Therefore for your sake shall Zion be ploughed up as a field, and Jerusalem shall become ruinous heaps, and the mount of the house, forest-covered high-places.
033	MIC	004	001	And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be firmly established on the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and unto it shall people flow.
033	MIC	004	002	And many nations shall come, and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob; that he may teach us of his ways, and we may walk in his paths; for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem.
033	MIC	004	003	And he shall judge between many people, and decide for strong nations even afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plough-shares, and their spears into pruning-knives: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, and they shall not learn any more war.
033	MIC	004	004	But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig-tree, with none to make them afraid; for the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken it.
033	MIC	004	005	[But] though all the people should walk every one in the name of his god, yet will we walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.
033	MIC	004	006	On that day, saith the Lord, will I assemble her that halteth, and her that is driven out will I gather, and her to whom I have done evil;
033	MIC	004	007	And I will make of her that halted a remnant, and of her that was cast off far away a strong nation: and the Lord will reign over them on mount Zion, from this time and unto eternity.
033	MIC	004	008	And thou, O tower of flocks, the strong-hold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall go, and shall come, the former dominion, the kingdom belonging to the daughter of Jerusalem.
033	MIC	004	009	Now why dost thou cry aloud? is there no king in thee? is thy counsellor lost? that pangs have seized on thee as on a woman in travail?
033	MIC	004	010	Be in pain, and labor to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail; for now shalt thou go forth out of the town, and thou shalt dwell in the field, and thou shalt go as far as Babylon; there shalt thou be delivered; there will the Lord redeem thee from the grasp of thy enemies.
033	MIC	004	011	And now many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye look with pleasure on Zion.
033	MIC	004	012	But they know not the thoughts of the Lord, and they understand not his counsel: that he will [once] gather them as the sheaves into the threshing-floor.
033	MIC	004	013	Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion; for I will render thy horn iron, and thy hoofs will I render copper, and thou shalt beat in pieces many people: and I will devote unto the Lord their ill-gotten gain, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.
033	MIC	005	001	Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops; they lay siege against us: with the rod they smite upon the cheek the judge of Israel.
033	MIC	005	002	But thou, Beth-lechem Ephratah, the least [though] thou be among the thousands of Judah, [yet] out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel, whose origin is from olden times, from most ancient days.
033	MIC	005	003	Therefore will he give them up, until the time that she who travaileth hath brought forth: then shall the remnant of his brethren return with the children of Israel.
033	MIC	005	004	And he shall stand forward and feed [Israel] through the strength of the Lord, through the excellency of the name of the Lord his God: and they shall abide [safely]; for now shall he be great even unto the ends of the earth.
033	MIC	005	005	And in this [manner] shall there be peace: If Asshur should come into our land; and if he should tread in our palaces, then will we raise up against him seven shepherds, and eight anointed men.
033	MIC	005	006	And they shall lay waste the land of Asshur with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in the gates of its [cities]: thus will he deliver us from Asshur, if he should come into our land, and if he should tread within our borders.
033	MIC	005	007	And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people like dew from the Lord, like showers upon the herbs, that wait not for man, nor hope for the sons of man.
033	MIC	005	008	And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the nations, in the midst of many people, like a lion among the beasts of the forest, like a young lion among flocks of sheep: who, if he break in, both treadeth down, and teareth in pieces, while none can deliver.
033	MIC	005	009	High shall thy hand be lifted up above thy adversaries, and all thy enemies shall be cut off.
033	MIC	005	010	And it shall come to pass on that day, saith the Lord, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots;
033	MIC	005	011	And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and I will throw down all thy strongholds;
033	MIC	005	012	And I will cut off the arts of witchcraft out of thy hand; and soothsayers shalt thou have no more;
033	MIC	005	013	And I will cut off thy graven images, and thy statues out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more prostrate thyself to the work of thy hands;
033	MIC	005	014	And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee; and I will destroy thy enemies.
033	MIC	005	015	And I will in anger and in fury execute vengeance upon the nations, upon those that have not hearkened.
033	MIC	006	001	Do but hear now what the Lord saith, Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.
033	MIC	006	002	Hear ye, O mountains, the controversy of the Lord, and ye strong foundations of the earth! for the Lord hath a controversy with his people, and with Israel will he plead.
033	MIC	006	003	O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherewith have I wearied thee? testify against me.
033	MIC	006	004	Although I had brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of bond-men; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.
033	MIC	006	005	O my people, do but remember what Balak the king of Moab resolved, and what Bil'am the son of Be'or answered him, from Shittim unto Gilgal, in order that ye may know the gracious benefits of the Lord.
033	MIC	006	006	Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, bow myself before the God on high? shall I come before him with burnt-offerings, with calves of a year old!
033	MIC	006	007	Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with myriads of streams of oil? shall I give my first-born for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
033	MIC	006	008	He hath told thee, O man, what is good; and what the Lord doth require of thee: [nothing] but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with thy God.
033	MIC	006	009	The voice of the Lord calleth unto the city, —and [the man of] wisdom shall see thy name: —hear ye the rod [of punishment], and who hath ordained it.
033	MIC	006	010	Are there yet in the house of the wicked man the treasures of wickedness, and the scant accursed measure?
033	MIC	006	011	Can I be pure with wicked balances, and with a bag [full] of deceptive weights?
033	MIC	006	012	For her rich men are full of violence, and her inhabitants have spoken falsehood, and their tongue is deceit [itself] in their mouth.
033	MIC	006	013	Therefore have I also smitten thee with sore wounds, making [thee] desolate because of thy sins.
033	MIC	006	014	Thou wilt indeed eat, but not be satisfied; and what thou hast eaten shall bend thee down; and thou wilt overtake [the enemy], but thou shalt not deliver; and that which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword.
033	MIC	006	015	Thou wilt indeed sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou wilt indeed tread out olives, but thou shalt not anoint thyself with oil; and the juice of the grapes, but thou shalt not drink wine.
033	MIC	006	016	For there are observed the statutes of 'Omri, and all the works of the house of Achab, and ye walk in their counsels: in order that I should give thee up unto desolation, and thy inhabitants to derision; and ye shall bear the reproach of my people.
033	MIC	007	001	Woe is me! for I am as in the gathering of the summer-fruits, as in the grape-gleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat, no first-ripe fruit for which my soul longeth.
033	MIC	007	002	The pious hath disappeared out of the land; and the upright among men there is none; all of them lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.
033	MIC	007	003	For the evil of your hands you expect good? while the prince demandeth [bribes], and the judge acteth for pay; and the great man is only speaking the wilful pleasure of his soul: and so do they make a network [of wrong].
033	MIC	007	004	The best of them is like a brier; the most upright is [sharper] than a thorn-hedge: the day of thy watchmen, thy punishment, is come; now shall be perplexity among them.
033	MIC	007	005	Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a confidant: from her that lieth in thy bosom guard the doors of thy mouth.
033	MIC	007	006	For the son disgraceth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a man's enemies are the men of his own house.
033	MIC	007	007	But I—I will look unto the Lord; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.
033	MIC	007	008	Rejoice not, O my enemy, over me: though I am fallen, I rise again: though I should sit in darkness, the Lord will be a light unto me.
033	MIC	007	009	The indignation of the Lord will I bear, because I have sinned against him; until that he plead my cause, and execute justice for me: [when] he will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his righteousness.
033	MIC	007	010	Then she that is my enemy will see it, and shame shall cover her, who said unto me, Where is the Lord thy God? My eyes shall complacently see her [suffer]: now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.
033	MIC	007	011	The day that thy fences are to be built—that same day, the ordained, is yet far removed.
033	MIC	007	012	It is a day when men shall come to thee from Assyria, and the cities of Mazor, and from Mazor even to the river, and from sea to sea, and [from] mountain to mountain.
033	MIC	007	013	While the land [of the nations] shall be made desolate because of its inhabitants, for the fruit of their doings.
033	MIC	007	014	Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thy heritage, which dwell in solitude in the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gil'ad, as in the days of old.
033	MIC	007	015	As in the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I let them see marvelous things.
033	MIC	007	016	Nations shall see and be ashamed of all their might: they shall lay their hand upon their mouth, their ears shall be deafened.
033	MIC	007	017	They shall lick the dust like the serpent; like those that crawl on the earth, shall they come forth trembling out of their close places: unto the Lord our God shall they hasten in dread, and shall be afraid of thee.
033	MIC	007	018	Who is a god like unto thee, pardoning iniquity, and forgiving transgression to the residue of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in kindness.
033	MIC	007	019	He will again have mercy on us, he will suppress our iniquities; yea, thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.
033	MIC	007	020	Thou wilt show faithfulness unto Jacob, and kindness unto Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers in the days of old.

# BOOK	034	NAH	Nahum	Nahum
034	NAH	001	001	The doom of Nineveh, The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.
034	NAH	001	002	A God watchful and avenging is the Lord; an avenger is the Lord, and full of fury; the Lord taketh vengeance on his adversaries, and keepeth in mind the deeds of his enemies.
034	NAH	001	003	The Lord is long-suffering, and great in power, but he will by no means clear the guilty: the Lord—in the whirlwind and in the storm is his way, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.
034	NAH	001	004	He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and all the rivers he drieth up: Bashan then withereth, with Carmel, and the flowers of Lebanon wither.
034	NAH	001	005	Mountains quake before him, and the hills melt away; and the earth is lifted up at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein.
034	NAH	001	006	Before his indignation who can stand? and who can subsist before the fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken down by him.
034	NAH	001	007	The Lord is good, a strong-hold on the day of distress; and he knoweth those that trust in him.
034	NAH	001	008	But with an overflowing flood will he utterly destroy the place of [Nineveh], and his enemies will he pursue with darkness.
034	NAH	001	009	What will you devise against the Lord? he is bringing about an utter destruction, the distress shall not rise up twice.
034	NAH	001	010	For they, like thorns interwoven, and as men made drunken in their drinking bout, shall be entirely consumed as dry stubble.
034	NAH	001	011	There is gone forth out of thee he that devised evil against the Lord, the counsellor of infamous things.
034	NAH	001	012	Thus hath said the Lord, Though they be complete, and ever so many, nevertheless shall they be cut down, and it shall be over [with them]: and if even I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.
034	NAH	001	013	For now will I break his yoke from off thee, and thy bonds will I tear asunder.
034	NAH	001	014	But against thee hath the Lord decreed, that no heir of thy name shall be any more: out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the graven and the molten image; I will prepare thy grave [there]; for thou art made vile.
034	NAH	001	015	Behold, upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace, Celebrate thy feasts, O Judah, fulfill thy vows; for never more shall the wicked pass again through thee, he is utterly cut off.
034	NAH	002	001	The destroyer is come up against thee to enclose [thee] with works of siege: look out on the way, make thy loins strong, strengthen [thyself] greatly with power.
034	NAH	002	002	For the Lord bringeth back again the excellency of Jacob, as also the excellency of Israel; for the plunderers have plundered them, and have wasted branches of their vines.
034	NAH	002	003	The shields of his mighty men are made red, the valiant men are [clothed] in scarlet: with the fire of the steel the chariots [glitter] on the day when he prepareth himself [for battle], and the spears are shaken.
034	NAH	002	004	In the streets the chariots rush madly along, they rattle through the public places: their appearance is like torches, they run along like the lightnings.
034	NAH	002	005	He will summon his valiant men, they shall stumble in their walk: they hasten to her walls, and the covering for defence is prepared.
034	NAH	002	006	The gates of the rivers are opened, and the palace is dissolved.
034	NAH	002	007	And the queen is carried away into exile stripped of her attire, and her maids moan as with the voice of doves, striking their hand upon their breast.
034	NAH	002	008	And Nineveh was like a pool of water from the days that she existed: yet now they flee. “Stand, stand,” [shall they cry,] but none shall look back.
034	NAH	002	009	Plunder silver, plunder gold; for without end are the treasures, there is an abundance of all precious vessels.
034	NAH	002	010	She is void, and emptied out, and wasted; and the heart melteth, and the knees totter, and trembling is in all loins, and the faces of them all are covered with blackness.
034	NAH	002	011	Where is [now] the dwelling of the lions, and what was the feeding-place of the young lions, where the lion, the lioness, and the lion's whelp walked, and none made them afraid?
034	NAH	002	012	The lion tore in pieces [prey] enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled with prey his holes, and his dens with what he had torn.
034	NAH	002	013	Behold, I will be against thee, saith the Lord of hosts, and I will burn into smoke thy chariots, and thy young lions shall the sword devour: and I will cut off from the earth thy preying, and no more shall be heard the voice of thy messengers.
034	NAH	003	001	Woe to the city of blood! it is all full of lies and robbery; never ceaseth the preying;
034	NAH	003	002	The noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of wheels, and of prancing horses, and of the skipping chariots.
034	NAH	003	003	Horsemen mount, and there are the flaming sword and the glittering spear: and there is a multitude of slain, and heaps of carcasses; and without end are the corpses; they stumble on their corpses;
034	NAH	003	004	Because of the multitude of the lewd deeds of the harlot, that is rich in gracefulness, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her lewd deeds, and families through her witchcrafts.
034	NAH	003	005	Behold, I will be against thee, saith the Lord of hosts; and I will lay thy skirts open over thy face, and I will let nations see thy nakedness, and kingdoms thy shame.
034	NAH	003	006	And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and defile thee, and will render thee a dirt-heap.
034	NAH	003	007	And it shall come to pass, that all they that see thee shall flee from thee, and say, Laid waste is Nineveh: who will condole with her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee?
034	NAH	003	008	Art thou better than No-amon, that was situated on the rivers, that had water round about her, the rampart of which was the sea, and the walls of which rose out of the sea?
034	NAH	003	009	Ethiopia the numerous, and Egypt that was without end, Put and Lubim were thy helpers.
034	NAH	003	010	Yet also she was exiled, was carried away into captivity; also her young children were dashed in pieces at the corners of all streets: and for her honorable men they cast lots, and all her great ones were bound with chains.
034	NAH	003	011	Thou also shalt be made drunken, thou shalt be hidden from view: thou also shalt seek refuge because of the enemy.
034	NAH	003	012	All thy strong-holds shall be like fig-trees with the first ripe figs, which, if they be shaken, will fall into the mouth of the eater.
034	NAH	003	013	Behold, thy people are become women in the midst of thee: unto thy enemies are the gates of thy land set wide open; the fire hath devoured thy bars.
034	NAH	003	014	Water for the siege draw for thyself, fortify thy strongholds: go into the clay, and tread the mortar, make strong the brick-kiln.
034	NAH	003	015	There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it shall devour thee up like the cankerworm: [though] thou make thyself many as the cankerworm; make thyself many as the locusts.
034	NAH	003	016	[Though] thou hadst multiplied thy merchants more than the stars of heaven: the cankerworm spreadeth itself out, and flieth away.
034	NAH	003	017	Thy crowned ones are like the locusts, and thy leaders like the swarms of locusts, which camp in the hedges on a cold day, but when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they are.
034	NAH	003	018	Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria; thy valiant men are at rest: scattered are thy people upon the mountains, and there is none that gathereth them.
034	NAH	003	019	There is no healing for thy breach; fatal is thy wound: all that hear the report of thee will clap their hands over thee; for over whom did not thy wickedness pass continually?

# BOOK	035	HAB	Habakkuk	Habakkuk
035	HAB	001	001	The prophecy which Habakkuk the prophet foresaw.
035	HAB	001	002	How long, O Lord, have I entreated [thee], and thou wouldst not hear? [how long] shall I cry out unto thee [because of] violence, and thou wilt not save?
035	HAB	001	003	Why wilt thou let me see wickedness, and wilt look on trouble, and the robbery and violence [that are] before me: while there is strife, and contention lifteth up [its head]?
035	HAB	001	004	Therefore is the law powerless, and justice cometh not forth victorious; for the wicked encompasseth about the righteous; therefore doth justice come forth perverted.
035	HAB	001	005	Look ye about among the nations, and behold and be astonished and astounded; for [God] will fulfill a work in your days, ye would not believe it, if it were only told you.
035	HAB	001	006	For, lo, I will raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and impetuous nation, that march to the wide spaces of the earth to conquer dwelling-places that are not theirs.
035	HAB	001	007	Terrible and dreadful are they: from themselves go forth their judicial laws and their dignity.
035	HAB	001	008	And swifter than leopards are their horses, and fiercer than the evening wolves; and their horsemen spread themselves abroad: and their horsemen will come from afar; they will fly like the eagle hastening to eat.
035	HAB	001	009	They all will come for violence: the front of their faces is like the east wind, and they gather captives as the sand.
035	HAB	001	010	And they will make sport with kings, and princes will be a play unto them: at every strong-hold will they laugh, and they will cast up earth-mounds and capture it.
035	HAB	001	011	Then doth their spirit become arrogant, and they are surpassingly proud, and offend, [imputing] this their power unto their god.
035	HAB	001	012	Art thou not from everlasting, O Lord my God, my Holy One? we shall not die. O Lord, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O Protector, thou hast appointed them to correct [nations].
035	HAB	001	013	Thou, who art too pure of eyes to behold evil, and canst not look on trouble, wherefore wilt thou look upon those that deal treacherously, be silent when the wicked swalloweth up him that is more righteous than he?
035	HAB	001	014	And [why] makest thou men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?
035	HAB	001	015	All of them he bringeth up with the angle, he draggeth them up in his net, and gathereth them in his drag: therefore he rejoiceth and is glad.
035	HAB	001	016	Therefore he sacrificeth unto his net, and burneth incense unto his drag; because through them is his portion fat, and his food marrowy.
035	HAB	001	017	Shall he therefore [always] empty his net, and continually slay nations without sparing?
035	HAB	002	001	Upon my watch will I stand, and place myself upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will speak with me, and what I shall answer to my reproof.
035	HAB	002	002	And the Lord answered me, and said, Write down the vision, and make it plain upon the tables, that everyone may read it fluently.
035	HAB	002	003	For there is yet a vision for the appointed time, and it speaketh of the end, and it will not deceive: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not be delayed.
035	HAB	002	004	Behold, disturbed, not at rest is the soul of [the wicked] in him; but the righteous ever liveth in his [trustful] faith.
035	HAB	002	005	And though the wine-[drunken] traitor, the proud man, whose house will not stand, who enlargeth his desire as the grave, and is like death, which cannot be satisfied, —though he gather unto him all the nations, and assemble unto him all the people:
035	HAB	002	006	Will not all these take up a parable against him, and a proverb and a satire concerning him? and they will say, Woe to him that increaseth what is not his! for how long? and to him that loadeth himself with a burden of guilt!
035	HAB	002	007	Behold, suddenly will rise up those that afflict thee, and awake those that plague thee, and thou shalt become a booty unto them.
035	HAB	002	008	Because thou hast despoiled many nations will all the remnant of the people despoil thee; because of the blood of men, and the violence against the land, the town, and all that dwell therein.
035	HAB	002	009	Woe to him that obtaineth an evil gain for his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the grasp of the wicked!
035	HAB	002	010	Thou hast counselled shame to thy house, by cutting off many people, and sinning [against] thy soul.
035	HAB	002	011	For the stone will cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the wood [-work] will answer it.
035	HAB	002	012	Woe to him that buildeth a city with blood-guiltiness, and layeth the foundation of a town by wrong-doing.
035	HAB	002	013	Behold, is it not from the Lord of hosts that people shall labor for the very fire, and nations shall weary themselves for naught but vanity!
035	HAB	002	014	For the earth shall be filled with knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.
035	HAB	002	015	Woe unto him that maketh his neighbors drink, [to thee] that pourest out thy poisonous [wine], and makest them also drunken, in order to look on their nakedness!
035	HAB	002	016	Thou art filled with shame instead of glory; drink thou also, and let thy nakedness be uncovered: there shall be turned around thee the cup of the Lord's right hand, and filthy spittle shall be on thy glory.
035	HAB	002	017	For the violence against Lebanon shall cover thee, and the destruction of beasts, which he terrified away; because of the blood of men, and the violence against the land, the town, and all that dwell therein.
035	HAB	002	018	What profiteth the graven image that its maker hath graven it? the molten image, and a teacher of falsehood? that the maker of his image trusteth therein, while making dumb idols?
035	HAB	002	019	Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake! Rouse up to the dumb stone. Shall this teach? Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, and no breath whatever is in its bosom.
035	HAB	002	020	But the Lord is in his holy temple: be silent before him all the earth.
035	HAB	003	001	A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigyonoth.
035	HAB	003	002	O Lord, I have heard thy fame, [and] was afraid: O Lord, thy work—in the midst of the years [of sorrow] revive thou it, in the midst of the years make it known; in wrath remember mercy.
035	HAB	003	003	[When] God from Theman came, and the Holy One from mount Paran, (Selah) his glory covered the heavens, and of his praise the earth was full.
035	HAB	003	004	And [his] brightness was like the sunlight; rays streamed forth out of his hand unto them; and there was the hiding of his power.
035	HAB	003	005	Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth in his steps.
035	HAB	003	006	He stood forward, and made the earth tremble; he looked and dispersed nations; and there burst asunder the everlasting mountains; there sunk the perpetual hills: the ways of the world are his.
035	HAB	003	007	In affliction I saw the tents of Cushan: they trembled—the curtains of the land of Midian.
035	HAB	003	008	Was the Lord wroth against the rivers? yea, was against the rivers thy anger [kindled]? was against the sea thy wrath that thou rodest upon thy horses, thy chariots of victory!
035	HAB	003	009	Laid quite bare is thy bow, like severe rods of punishment [goeth forth] thy word, (Selah) into rivers thou splittest the earth.
035	HAB	003	010	The mountains saw thee, they trembled; the flowing waters passed along: the deep issued forth its voice, the height lifted up its hands.
035	HAB	003	011	The sun and moon stood still in their dwelling: at the light of thy arrows they walked along, at the shining of the flaming glitter of thy spear.
035	HAB	003	012	In indignation thou marchest through the earth, in anger thou treadest down nations.
035	HAB	003	013	Thou wentest forth to the assistance of thy people, to the assistance of thy anointed: thou didst wound the head out of the house of the wicked, destroy the foundation with the high-towering walls. (Selah)
035	HAB	003	014	Thou didst strike through with his own spears the chiefs of his villages, who rushed out furiously to scatter me; who rejoiced greatly as though they were to devour the poor in secret.
035	HAB	003	015	[But] thou didst pass along over the sea with thy horses, over the piled up billows of great waters.
035	HAB	003	016	I heard it, and my inmost parts trembled; at the report my lips quivered; rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in my place, that I should rest till the day of distress, till the withdrawing of the people that will invade us with its troops.
035	HAB	003	017	For the fig-tree doth not bud, and no fruit is on the vines; the productiveness of the olive deceiveth, and the fields yield no food; from the fold the flocks are cut off, and there are no herds in the stalls.
035	HAB	003	018	Yet will I rejoice in the Lord, I will exult in the God of my salvation.
035	HAB	003	019	The Lord Eternal is my strength, and he maketh my feet fleet as those of the hinds, and he will cause me to tread upon my high places. To the chief musician of my songs.

# BOOK	036	ZEP	Zephaniah	Zephaniah
036	ZEP	001	001	The word of the Lord which came unto Zephanyah the son of Cushi, the son of Gedalyah, the son of Amaryah, the son of Chizkiyah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon the king of Judah.
036	ZEP	001	002	I will remove, utterly remove all things from off the face of the earth, saith the Lord.
036	ZEP	001	003	I will remove man and beast; I will remove the fowls of the heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumbling blocks together with the wicked; and I will cut off man from off the face of the earth, saith the Lord.
036	ZEP	001	004	And I will stretch out my hand over Judah, and over all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Ba'al from this place, the name of his ministers with his priests;
036	ZEP	001	005	And those that bow themselves down on the roofs of houses to the host of heaven; and those that bow themselves down that are sworn [to be true] to the Lord and still swear by Malkom;
036	ZEP	001	006	And those that are turned away from following the Lord; and those that have not sought for the Lord, and have not inquired of him.
036	ZEP	001	007	Be silent in the presence of the Lord Eternal; for nigh is the day of the Lord; for the Lord hath prepared a slaughter, he hath bidden his invited guests.
036	ZEP	001	008	And it shall come to pass on the day of the Lord's slaughter, that I will inflict punishment on the princes, and on the king's sons, and on all such as are clothed in garments of a foreign land.
036	ZEP	001	009	And I will inflict punishment on all those that leap over the threshold on that day, who fill the house of their master with violence and deceit.
036	ZEP	001	010	And it shall come to pass on that day, saith the Lord, that there shall be a loud cry of lamentation from the fish-gate, and a wailing from the second, and [that of] a great breach from the hills.
036	ZEP	001	011	Wail, ye inhabitants of the mortar-street, for destroyed are all the trading people; cut off are all that were laden with silver.
036	ZEP	001	012	And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem through with lights; and I will inflict punishment on the men that are at rest on their lees, that say in their heart, The Lord will not do good, nor will he do evil.
036	ZEP	001	013	And their wealth shall become a booty, and their houses shall be made desolate; and they will build houses, but they shall not inhabit them; and they will plant vineyards, but they shall not drink their wine.
036	ZEP	001	014	Nigh is the great day of the Lord, it is nigh, and hasteneth greatly, [there is] the noise of the day of the Lord: bitterly crieth there the mighty man.
036	ZEP	001	015	A day of wrath is that day, a day of distress and anxiety, a day of wasting and desolation, a day of darkness and obscurity, a day of clouds and tempestuous gloom,
036	ZEP	001	016	A day of the cornet and alarm, against the fenced cities, and against the high battlements.
036	ZEP	001	017	And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk about like the blind, because against the Lord have they sinned: and their blood shall be poured out like the dust, and their flesh like the dung.
036	ZEP	001	018	Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them on the day of the Lord's wrath; through the fire of whose zeal the whole land shall be devoured; for destruction, yea, quite sudden, will he prepare for all the inhabitants of the land.
036	ZEP	002	001	Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation without desire [for repentance];
036	ZEP	002	002	Before the decree is brought forth—like the chaff the day passeth away—before yet there be come over you the fierce anger of the Lord, before yet there be come over you the day of the anger of the Lord.
036	ZEP	002	003	Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, who have fulfilled his ordinances; seek righteousness, seek meekness: perhaps ye will be protected on the day of the Lord's anger.
036	ZEP	002	004	For Gazzah shall become forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolate place: Ashdod shall they drive out at the noon of day, and Ekron shall be rooted up.
036	ZEP	002	005	Woe unto the inhabitants of the district by the sea, the nation of the Kerethites! the word of the Lord is against you, O Canaan, the land of the Philistines, I will even destroy thee, that no inhabitant shall remain.
036	ZEP	002	006	And the district by the sea shall become places for pens of shepherds, and folds for flocks.
036	ZEP	002	007	And this district shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; thereupon shall they feed their flocks: in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening; for the Lord their God will think of them, and bring back their captivity.
036	ZEP	002	008	I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of 'Ammon, wherewith they have reproached my people, and made themselves great against their border.
036	ZEP	002	009	Therefore as I live, saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall become like Sodom, and the children of 'Ammon like Gomorrah, overgrown with nettles, and [filled with] salt-pits, and a desolation to eternity; the residue of my people shall plunder them, and the remnant of my nation shall possess them.
036	ZEP	002	010	This shall they have in recompense for their pride; because they have reproached and made themselves great against the people of the Lord of hosts.
036	ZEP	002	011	Terrible will the Lord [appear] over them; for he will cause to vanish all the gods of the earth; and then shall prostrate themselves before him, every one from its place, all the isles of the nations.
036	ZEP	002	012	Also ye Ethiopians shall be those slain by my sword.
036	ZEP	002	013	And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria; and he will make Nineveh a desolate place, dry, like the wilderness.
036	ZEP	002	014	And there shall lie down in the midst of her flocks, all the beasts of the nations; both the pelican and the hedgehog shall lodge in the capitals of her columns; singing-birds shall sing in the windows; ruin shall be on the thresholds; for the cedar wainscoting shall be torn away.
036	ZEP	002	015	This is the joyful city that dwelt in security, that said in her heart, I am, and there is none else beside me: how is she become desolate, a resting-place for beasts! every one that passeth by her will hiss, and shake his hand.
036	ZEP	003	001	Woe to her that is rebellious and polluted, to the oppressing city!
036	ZEP	003	002	She hearkened not to any voice; she accepted no correction; in the Lord she did not trust; to her God she drew not near.
036	ZEP	003	003	Her princes in her midst are roaring lions: her judges are evening wolves, they leave not a bone for the morning.
036	ZEP	003	004	Her prophets are thoughtless men of treachery: her priests have profaned the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law.
036	ZEP	003	005	The just Lord is in her midst, he will not do wrong; morning after morning doth he bring his justice to the light [of day], it never faileth; but the unjust knoweth no shame.
036	ZEP	003	006	I have cut off nations; destroyed are their battlements; I have laid in ruins their streets, so that none passeth through; their cities are wasted, without a man, without an inhabitant.
036	ZEP	003	007	I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt accept correction; so that her dwelling should not be cut off, all that I had decreed to bring over her; but they rose up early, they acted corruptly in all their doings.
036	ZEP	003	008	Therefore wait but for me, saith the Lord, for the day that I rise up to the prey; for my judgment [cometh] to gather the nations, for me to assemble the kingdoms, to pour over them my indignation, all the fierceness of my anger; for through the fire of my jealousy shall all the earth be devoured.
036	ZEP	003	009	Yea then will I change unto the people a pure language, that they may all call on the name of the Lord, to serve him with one accord.
036	ZEP	003	010	From beyond the rivers of Cush shall they bring my suppliants, even the assembly of my dispersed, as an offering unto me.
036	ZEP	003	011	On that day shalt thou not be ashamed because of all thy doings, whereby thou hast transgressed against me; for then will I remove out of the midst of thee those that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt never more be haughty again on my holy mount.
036	ZEP	003	012	And I will leave remaining in the midst of thee a humble and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the Lord.
036	ZEP	003	013	The remnant of Israel shall not do injustice, nor speak lies; and there shall not be found in their mouth a deceitful tongue; for they shall feed and lie down, with none to make them afraid.
036	ZEP	003	014	Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; rejoice and be glad with all thy heart, O daughter of Jerusalem!
036	ZEP	003	015	The Lord hath removed thy punishment, he hath cleared away thy enemy: the king of Israel, the Lord, is in the midst of thee; thou shalt not see evil any more.
036	ZEP	003	016	On that day shall it be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: [to] Zion, Let not thy hands become weak.
036	ZEP	003	017	The Lord thy God is in the midst of thee, the mighty one who will save; he will be glad over thee with rejoicing; he will be silent in his love, he will exult over thee with song.
036	ZEP	003	018	Those that mourn far away from the festive assembly do I gather, those that were separated from thee, [that have borne] for thee the burden of reproach.
036	ZEP	003	019	Behold, I will deal [severely] with all that afflict thee at that time: and I will save her that halteth, and her that was driven off will I gather; and I will render them a praise and a famous name on all the earth where they have been put to shame.
036	ZEP	003	020	At that time will I bring you back, even in the time that I gather you; for I will make you for a name and for a praise among all people of the earth, when I bring back again your captives before your eyes, saith the Lord.

# BOOK	037	HAG	Haggai	Haggai
037	HAG	001	001	In the second year of king Darius, in the sixth month, on the first day of the month, came the word of the Lord through means of Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealthiel, the governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, saying,
037	HAG	001	002	Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, saying, This people have said, The time is not yet come, the time for the Lord's house to be built.
037	HAG	001	003	And the word of the Lord came by means of Haggai the prophet, saying,
037	HAG	001	004	Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your ceiled houses, while this house lieth in ruins?
037	HAG	001	005	Now therefore, thus hath said the Lord of hosts, Direct your heart unto your ways.
037	HAG	001	006	Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but it doth not satisfy hunger; ye drink, but it doth not appease thirst; ye clothe yourselves, but no one is warm; and he that earneth something earneth it for a bag with holes.
037	HAG	001	007	Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, Direct your heart to your ways.
037	HAG	001	008	Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house: that I may take pleasure in it, and be glorified, saith the Lord.
037	HAG	001	009	[Till now] ye looked for much, and lo, it came to be little; and when ye brought it home, I blew upon it. For what cause? saith the Lord of hosts. Because of my house that lieth in ruins, while ye run every man unto his own house.
037	HAG	001	010	Therefore do the heavens for your sake withhold the dew, and the earth withholdeth her products.
037	HAG	001	011	And I called for a drought over the land, and over the mountains, and over the corn, and over the new wine, and over the oil, and over what the ground bringeth forth, and over men, and over cattle, and over all the labor of the hands.
037	HAG	001	012	Then hearkened Zerubbabel the son of Shealthiel, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, unto the voice of the Lord their God, and to the words of Haggai the prophet, as the Lord their God had sent him, and the people were afraid of the Lord.
037	HAG	001	013	Then said Haggai the messenger of the Lord by the Lord's message unto the people saying, I am with you, saith the Lord.
037	HAG	001	014	And the Lord stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealthiel, the governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people, and they came and did work on the house of the Lord of hosts, their God.
037	HAG	001	015	On the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the second year of king Darius.
037	HAG	002	001	In the seventh [month], on the one and twentieth day of the month, came the word of the Lord by means of Haggai the prophet, saying,
037	HAG	002	002	Do say to Zerubbabel the son of Shealthiel, the governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the residue of the people, saying,
037	HAG	002	003	Who is there yet left among you that hath seen this house in its first glory? and how do ye see it now? is it not in comparison with it as nothing in your eyes?
037	HAG	002	004	Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the Lord, and be strong O Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the Lord, and do; [for I am with you, saith the Lord of hosts,]
037	HAG	002	005	[In accordance with] the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, so [will] my spirit remain among you: fear nought.
037	HAG	002	006	For thus hath said the Lord of hosts, Yet one thing more [will I do], it is but little, when I will cause to quake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;
037	HAG	002	007	And I will cause to quake all the nations, and the precious things of all the nations shall come [hither]: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the Lord of hosts.
037	HAG	002	008	Mine is the silver, and mine is the gold, saith the Lord of hosts.
037	HAG	002	009	Greater shall be the glory of this latter house than that of the former, saith the Lord of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, saith the Lord of hosts.
037	HAG	002	010	On the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the Lord by means of Haggai the prophet, saying,
037	HAG	002	011	Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, Do ask the priests concerning the law, saying,
037	HAG	002	012	Lo! if one should carry holy flesh in the corner of his garment, and touch with his corner bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any food, shall it become holy? And the priests answered and said, No.
037	HAG	002	013	Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead body shall touch any of these, will it become unclean? And the priests answered and said, It will become unclean.
037	HAG	002	014	Then answered Haggai, and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith the Lord; and so are all works of their hands; and what they offer there is unclean.
037	HAG	002	015	And now direct, I pray you, your heart from this day and upward, before the time that a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the Lord:
037	HAG	002	016	Since those days were, when one came to a heap of sheaves of twenty [in number], and there were but ten; when one came to the winepress for to draw off fifty measures out of the vat, and there were but twenty.
037	HAG	002	017	I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the labors of your hands: yet ye [turned] not [back] to me, saith the Lord.
037	HAG	002	018	Direct, I pray you, your heart from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, even from the day that the foundation of the Lord's temple was laid, direct your heart [to this].
037	HAG	002	019	Is the seed yet in the barn? yes, as yet the vine, and the fig-tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive-tree, have not brought forth; [but] from this day will I bless you.
037	HAG	002	020	And the word of the Lord came the second time unto Haggai on the four and twentieth day of the month, saying,
037	HAG	002	021	Speak to Zerubbabel the governor of Judah, saying, I will cause to quake the heavens and the earth;
037	HAG	002	022	And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations; and I will overthrow chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother.
037	HAG	002	023	On that day, saith the Lord of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, the son of Shealthiel, my servant, saith the Lord, and I will place thee as a signet; for of thee have I made choice, saith the Lord of hosts.

# BOOK	038	ZEC	Zechariah	Zechariah
038	ZEC	001	001	In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the Lord unto Zechariah, the son of Berechyah, the son of 'Iddo the prophet, saying,
038	ZEC	001	002	The Lord hath been greatly angry with your fathers.
038	ZEC	001	003	And [now] say thou unto them, Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, Return ye unto me, saith the Lord of hosts, and I will return unto you: so hath said the Lord of hosts.
038	ZEC	001	004	Be ye not like your fathers, unto whom the former prophets proclaimed, saying, Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, Do return from your evil ways, and your evil doings; but they did not hear, nor listen unto me, saith the Lord.
038	ZEC	001	005	Your fathers, —where are they! and the prophets, — could they live for ever!
038	ZEC	001	006	But my words and my decrees, which I commanded my servants the prophets, behold, they did overtake your fathers: and [then] they returned and said, Just as the Lord of hosts had purposed to do unto us, in accordance with our ways, and in accordance with our doings, so hath he dealt with us.
038	ZEC	001	007	On the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the Lord unto Zechariah, the son of Berechyahu, the son of 'Iddo the prophet, saying,
038	ZEC	001	008	I saw this night, and behold there was a man riding upon a red horse, and he was standing among the myrtle-trees that were in the deep valley; and behind him were red, pale, and white horses.
038	ZEC	001	009	And I said, What are these, O my lord? Then said unto me the angel that spoke with me, I will show thee what these are.
038	ZEC	001	010	And the man that stood among the myrtle-trees answered and said, These are those whom the Lord hath sent to traverse the earth.
038	ZEC	001	011	And they answered the angel of the Lord that stood among the myrtle-trees, and said, We have traversed the earth, and, behold, all the earth is inhabited quietly, and is at rest.
038	ZEC	001	012	Then commenced the angel of the Lord, and said, O Lord of hosts, how long yet wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast been indignant these seventy years?
038	ZEC	001	013	And the Lord answered the angel that spoke with me with good words and comforting words.
038	ZEC	001	014	And the angel that spoke with me said unto me, Proclaim thou, saying, Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.
038	ZEC	001	015	And with a great anger will I be angry with the nations that are at ease; for I was but a little angry [with Zion], and they helped forward the mischief.
038	ZEC	001	016	Therefore thus hath said the Lord, I am returned to Jerusalem in mercy: my house shall be rebuilt in it, saith the Lord of hosts, and the measuring-line shall be stretched forth over Jerusalem.
038	ZEC	001	017	Proclaim yet [farther], saying, Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, My cities shall again overflow with prosperity: and the Lord will again comfort Zion, and make choice again of Jerusalem.
038	ZEC	001	018	And I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, there were four horns.
038	ZEC	001	019	And I said unto the angel who spoke with me, What are these? And he said unto me, These are the horns that have dispersed Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.
038	ZEC	001	020	And the Lord showed me four carpenters.
038	ZEC	001	021	Then said I, What are these coming to do? And he said as followeth, These are the horns that have dispersed Judah, to the extent that no man could lift up his head; but these are come to terrify them, to cast off the horns of the nations, that have been lifting up their horn over the land of Judah to disperse it.
038	ZEC	002	001	And I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold, there was a man with a measure-cord in his hand.
038	ZEC	002	002	Then said I, Whither art thou going? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is her breadth, and what is her length.
038	ZEC	002	003	And, behold, the angel that spoke with me went out, and another angel came out to meet him;
038	ZEC	002	004	And he said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Without walls shall Jerusalem be inhabited because of the multitude of men and cattle in her midst.
038	ZEC	002	005	But I—I will be unto her, saith the Lord, a wall of fire round about, and for glory will I be in the midst of her.
038	ZEC	002	006	Up! up! and flee away from the land of the north saith the Lord; for as the four winds of the heaven have I spread you abroad, saith the Lord.
038	ZEC	002	007	Up, Zion, escape, thou that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon.
038	ZEC	002	008	For thus hath said the Lord of hosts, For the sake of [your] glory hath he sent me unto the nations that have despoiled you; for whoever toucheth you, toucheth the apple of his eye.
038	ZEC	002	009	For, behold, I will swing my hand over them, and they shall be a spoil to those that served them: and ye shall acknowledge that the Lord of hosts hath sent me.
038	ZEC	002	010	Sing, and rejoice, O daughter of Zion; for, lo, I am coming, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the Lord.
038	ZEC	002	011	And many nations will join themselves to the Lord on that day, and they shall be unto me for a people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto thee.
038	ZEC	002	012	And the Lord will take Judah as his inheritance upon the holy land; and he will again make choice of Jerusalem.
038	ZEC	002	013	Be silent, all flesh! before the Lord; for he is waked up out of his holy habitation.
038	ZEC	003	001	And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord, and the accuser standing at his right hand to accuse him.
038	ZEC	003	002	And the Lord said unto the accuser, The Lord rebuke thee, O Accuser; yea, the Lord rebuke thee that hath chosen Jerusalem: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?
038	ZEC	003	003	Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the angel.
038	ZEC	003	004	And he commenced and said unto those that stood before him, saying; Take away the filthy garments from him. And he said unto him, Behold, I have caused thy iniquity to pass from off thee, and I clothe thee with festive garments.
038	ZEC	003	005	And I said, Let them place a clean mitre upon his head. So they placed the clean mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments; rind the angel of the Lord stood by.
038	ZEC	003	006	And the angel of the Lord forewarned Joshua, saying,
038	ZEC	003	007	Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then shalt thou also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by.
038	ZEC	003	008	Do but hear, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee; for distinguished men are they; for, behold, I will bring my servant Zemach [the Sprout].
038	ZEC	003	009	For behold [here is] the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave thereon its inscription, saith the Lord of hosts, And I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.
038	ZEC	003	010	On that day, saith the Lord of hosts, shall ye call every man to his neighbor under the vine and under the fig-tree.
038	ZEC	004	001	And the angel that spoke with me came back again, and waked me up, as a man that is wakened up out of his sleep;
038	ZEC	004	002	And he said unto me, What art thou seeing? And I said, I have looked, and behold, there is a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon its top, and its seven lamps are thereupon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon its top:
038	ZEC	004	003	And two olive-trees are by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof.
038	ZEC	004	004	And I commenced and said unto the angel that spoke with me, saying, What are these, my lord?
038	ZEC	004	005	Then the angel that spoke with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these are? And I said, No, my lord.
038	ZEC	004	006	Then answered he and spoke unto me, saying, This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.
038	ZEC	004	007	Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou wilt become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone with shoutings of, Grace, grace unto it.
038	ZEC	004	008	And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
038	ZEC	004	009	The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands shall complete it: and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto you.
038	ZEC	004	010	For whoever even despised the day of [its] small beginning: yet will they rejoice when they see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel, with those seven; they are the eyes of the Lord, which hold a survey through all the earth.
038	ZEC	004	011	And I began, and said unto him, What are these two olive-trees upon the right side of the candle-stick and upon its left?
038	ZEC	004	012	And I began a second time, and said unto him, What are these two olive-branches, which are close by the two golden pipes which empty out of themselves the gold-colored oil?
038	ZEC	004	013	And he said to me as followeth, Knowest thou not what these things are? And I said, No, my lord.
038	ZEC	004	014	Then said he, These are the two sons of the clear oil, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.
038	ZEC	005	001	And I again lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold there was a flying roll[-book].
038	ZEC	005	002	And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll, its length is twenty cubits, and its breadth ten cubits.
038	ZEC	005	003	Then said he unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of all the earth; for every one that stealeth as it is on this side shall be in an equal degree entirely destroyed, as also every one that sweareth [falsely] as it is on that side shall be likewise entirely destroyed.
038	ZEC	005	004	I bring it forth, saith the Lord of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall consume it with its timber and its stones.
038	ZEC	005	005	Then went forth the angel that spoke with me, and said unto me, Do but lift up thy eyes, and see what is this that goeth forth.
038	ZEC	005	006	And I said, What is it? And he said, This is an ephah that goeth forth. He said moreover, This is their appearance through all the earth.
038	ZEC	005	007	And, behold, there was lifted up a heavy [cover] of lead: and there was a certain woman sitting in the midst of the ephah.
038	ZEC	005	008	And he said, This is the wickedness. And he cast her into the midst of the ephah; and he cast the weighty lead cover upon the mouth thereof.
038	ZEC	005	009	Then did I lift up my eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came out two women, having the wind in their wings, and they had wings like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven.
038	ZEC	005	010	Then said I to the angel that spoke with me, Whither are these bearing away the ephah?
038	ZEC	005	011	And he said unto me, To build for it a house in the land of Shin'ar: and when this is erected, then will the other be set there upon its own base.
038	ZEC	006	001	And I again lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold, there came out four chariots from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of copper.
038	ZEC	006	002	In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot, black horses:
038	ZEC	006	003	And in the third chariot, white horses; and in the fourth chariot, grizzled, ash-colored horses.
038	ZEC	006	004	And I began and said unto the angel that spoke with me, What are these, my lord?
038	ZEC	006	005	And the angel answered and said unto me, These are the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth after having stood before the Lord of all the earth.
038	ZEC	006	006	The [chariot] on which are black horses—these go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grizzled go forth toward the south country.
038	ZEC	006	007	And the red-colored were gone forth, and sought to traverse the earth: and he said, Go, traverse the earth. So they traversed the earth.
038	ZEC	006	008	Then cried he loudly unto me, and spoke unto me, saying, Behold, these that are going toward the north country, have quieted [the indignation of] my spirit in the north country.
038	ZEC	006	009	And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
038	ZEC	006	010	Take from the exiles, from Cheldai, from Tobiyahu, and from Yeda'yah, and thou shalt come on the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephanyah, whither they have arrived from Babylon;
038	ZEC	006	011	Take also silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua, the son of Jehozadak the high priest;
038	ZEC	006	012	And thou shalt say unto him as followeth, Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, saying, Behold a man, Sprout is his name; since out of his own place shall he sprout up, even he shall build the temple of the Lord:
038	ZEC	006	013	Yea, he shall build the temple of the Lord; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and a priest shall be upon his own throne; and the counsel of peace shall be between both of them.
038	ZEC	006	014	And the crowns shall be for Chelem, and for Tobiyah, and for Yeda'yah, and for Chen the son of Zephanyah, as a memorial in the temple of the Lord.
038	ZEC	006	015	And distant ones shall come and build on the temple of the Lord, and ye shall know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto you. And this shall come to pass, if ye will diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord your God.
038	ZEC	007	001	And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius that the word of the Lord came unto Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, in Kislev;
038	ZEC	007	002	When they had sent unto Beth-el Sherezer and Regem-melech, and his men, to make entreaty before the Lord.
038	ZEC	007	003	[And] to say unto the priests who were in the house of the Lord of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Shall I weep in the fifth month with abstinence, as I have done already these many years?
038	ZEC	007	004	Then came the word of the Lord of hosts unto me, saying,
038	ZEC	007	005	Say unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, as followeth, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the seventh [month], already these seventy years, did ye in anywise fast for me, yea, for me?
038	ZEC	007	006	And if ye do eat, and if ye do drink, are ye not yourselves those that eat, and yourselves those that drink?
038	ZEC	007	007	Are not these the words which the Lord hath proclaimed by means of the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, with her cities round about her, when [men] inhabited the south, and the lowlands?
038	ZEC	007	008	And the word of the Lord came unto Zechariah, saying,
038	ZEC	007	009	Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, saying, Execute true justice, and show kindness and mercy every man to his brother;
038	ZEC	007	010	And defraud not the widow, or the fatherless, the stranger, or the poor; and imagine not evil in your heart one against the other.
038	ZEC	007	011	But they refused to listen, and turned away rebelliously the shoulder, and stopped their ears, so as not to hear;
038	ZEC	007	012	And their heart they rendered as an adamant, so as not to hear the law, and the words which the Lord of hosts had sent through his spirit, by means of the former prophets: wherefore came a great anger from the Lord of hosts.
038	ZEC	007	013	And it is come to pass, that as he proclaimed, and they would not hear: so had they to call, and I would not hear, saith the Lord of hosts;
038	ZEC	007	014	And I resolved to scatter them with a storm-wind among all the nations that they had not known; and the land was left desolate after them, without any one to pass through it forward or backward; and the pleasant land have they changed into a desert.
038	ZEC	008	001	And the word of the Lord of hosts came, saying,
038	ZEC	008	002	Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, I am jealous for Zion with a great jealousy, and with great fury am I jealous for her.
038	ZEC	008	003	Thus hath said the Lord, I return unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called, The city of truth; and the mount of the Lord of hosts, The holy mount.
038	ZEC	008	004	Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, Again shall there sit old men and old women in the streets of Jerusalem, and every one with his staff in his hand because of their multitude of years.
038	ZEC	008	005	And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in her streets.
038	ZEC	008	006	Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, If it should be marvelous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days, should it also be marvelous in my eyes? saith the Lord of hosts.
038	ZEC	008	007	Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, Behold, I will save my people from the east country and from the country of the setting of the sun;
038	ZEC	008	008	And I will bring them [back], that they may dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and they shall be unto me for a people, and I will be unto them for a God, in truth and in righteousness.
038	ZEC	008	009	Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words out of the mouth of the prophets, who [spoke] on the day that the foundation of the house of the Lord of hosts was laid, when the temple was to be built.
038	ZEC	008	010	For before those days there was no reward for man, nor any reward for beast; and for him that went out or came in there was no peace, because of the oppressor: and I let loose all men, every one against his neighbor.
038	ZEC	008	011	But now I am no more as in the former days unto the residue of this people, saith the Lord of hosts.
038	ZEC	008	012	For the seed shall be undisturbed; the vine shall give its fruit, and the ground shall give her production, and the heavens shall give their dew: and I will bestow on the remnant of this people all these things.
038	ZEC	008	013	And it shall come to pass, that, in the same degree as ye have been a curse among the nations, O house of Judah, and house of Israel, so will I save you and ye shall be a blessing: fear not; let your hands be strong.
038	ZEC	008	014	For thus hath said the Lord of hosts, As I had purposed to do you evil, when your fathers incensed me, saith the Lord of hosts, and I bethought myself not:
038	ZEC	008	015	So do I again purpose in these days to do well unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah; fear ye not.
038	ZEC	008	016	These are the things that ye shall do, Speak ye the truth every man to his neighbor; [with] truth and the judgment of peace judge ye in your gates;
038	ZEC	008	017	And let none of you think evil in your hearts against his neighbor; and love not a false oath, for all these are what I hate, saith the Lord.
038	ZEC	008	018	And the word of the Lord of hosts came unto me, saying,
038	ZEC	008	019	Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, The fast of the fourth, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth [month], shall become to the house of Judah gladness and joy, and merry festivals: only love ye the truth and peace.
038	ZEC	008	020	Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, [A time] shall yet be! when there shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities;
038	ZEC	008	021	And the inhabitants of one [city] shall go to another, saying, Let us only go to pray before the Lord, and to seek the Lord of hosts: I too will likewise go.
038	ZEC	008	022	And many people and strong nations shall come to seek the Lord of hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the Lord.
038	ZEC	008	023	Thus hath said the Lord of hosts, In those days [it shall happen], that ten men out of all the languages of the nations shall take hold—yea, they shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, Let us go with you; for we have heard that God is with you.
038	ZEC	009	001	The prophecy of the word of the Lord concerning the land of Chadrach, and Damascus his resting-place; for unto the Lord [will look] the eye of men, and [that of] all the tribes of Israel;
038	ZEC	009	002	And also concerning Chamath that is bordering thereon, Tyre, and Zidon, though it be very wise.
038	ZEC	009	003	And though Tyre have built herself a strong-hold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets:
038	ZEC	009	004	Behold, the Lord will drive her out, and he will strike down her power into the sea; and she herself shall be devoured with fire.
038	ZEC	009	005	Ashkelon shall see it, and fear; Gazzah also, and tremble greatly: and 'Ekron, for her trust will be made ashamed: and the king shall vanish from Gazzah, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.
038	ZEC	009	006	And aliens shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.
038	ZEC	009	007	And I will remove their bloody [-sacrifices] out of their mouth, and their abominations from between their teeth; and their land also shall be left for our God, and it shall be as a prince's [dwelling] in Judah, and 'Ekron shall be like Jebusi.
038	ZEC	009	008	And I will encamp about my house against armies, against those that pass to and fro, and there shall not pass over them any more an oppressor; for now do I look [on them] with my eyes.
038	ZEC	009	009	Be greatly glad, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem! behold, thy King will come unto thee, righteous and victorious is he, lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of a she-ass.
038	ZEC	009	010	And I will cut off chariots from Ephraim, and horses from Jerusalem, and there shall be cut off the battle-bow, and he shall speak peace unto the nations; and his dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth.
038	ZEC	009	011	As for thee also, because of the blood of thy covenant, do I send forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein there is no water.
038	ZEC	009	012	Return you to the strong-hold, ye hopeful prisoners: even today do I declare, that I will recompense twofold [good] unto thee.
038	ZEC	009	013	For I do bend Judah for me, grasp Ephraim [as] a bow; and I will stir up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Javan, and I will render thee as the sword of a mighty man.
038	ZEC	009	014	And the Lord will appear over them, and then will go forth like the lightning his arrow: and the Lord Eternal will blow on the cornet, and he will go along in the tempests of the south.
038	ZEC	009	015	The Lord of hosts will be a shield over them; and they shall devour [the prey], and subdue the sling-stones; and they shall drink, make a noise as one [drunken with] wine; and they shall be filled like the offering-bowls, like the corners of the altar.
038	ZEC	009	016	And the Lord their God will save them on that day as the flock of his people; for [like] the stones of a crown, will they elevate themselves over his land.
038	ZEC	009	017	For how great will be [that generation's] happiness, and how great its beauty! corn shall make the young men sing joyfully, and new wine the virgins.
038	ZEC	010	001	Ask from the Lord rain at the time of the latter rain, [from] the Lord who maketh lightning-clouds: and he will give unto them showers of rain, to every herb in the field.
038	ZEC	010	002	For the Theraphim speak vanity, and the diviners foresee a lie, and those that have dreams speak what is false, with nought do they comfort: therefore do they move about like a flock, they bleat, because [they have] no shepherd.
038	ZEC	010	003	Against the shepherds is my anger kindled, and on the he-goats will I inflict punishment; for the Lord of hosts thinketh of his flock, the house of Judah, and maketh them as his elegant horse in the battle.
038	ZEC	010	004	Out of him cometh forth the corner [-stone], out of him the tent-nail, out of him the battle-bow, out of him every ruler [of others] together.
038	ZEC	010	005	And they shall be like mighty men, treading down [their enemies] in the mire of the streets in the battle, and they shall fight, because the Lord is with them: and the riders on horses shall be made ashamed.
038	ZEC	010	006	And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and the house of Joseph will I save, and I will bring them again to their own homes; for I have mercy upon them, and they shall be as though I had never cast them off; for I am the Lord their God, and I will answer their prayer.
038	ZEC	010	007	And they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their heart shall rejoice as though from wine: and their children shall see it, and be rejoiced; their heart shall be glad in the Lord.
038	ZEC	010	008	I will call for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them: and they shall increase as they have increased [formerly].
038	ZEC	010	009	And when I shall have scattered them among the people, they will remember me in the far-off countries: therefore shall they live with their children, and return again.
038	ZEC	010	010	And I will bring them back again out of the land of Egypt, and out of Assyria will I gather them; and into the land of Gil'ad and Lebanon will I bring them, and it shall not be sufficient for them.
038	ZEC	010	011	And he will pass through the sea [with] distress, and he will smite in the sea the waves, and there shall dry up all the deeps of the stream: and there shall be brought down the pride of Assyria, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away.
038	ZEC	010	012	And I will strengthen them in the Lord, and in his name shall they ever walk, saith the Lord.
038	ZEC	011	001	Open thy doors, O Lebanon, and the fire shall eat on thy cedars.
038	ZEC	011	002	Wail, fir-tree; for fallen is the cedar; those that were mighty are despoiled: wail, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the impervious forest is come down.
038	ZEC	011	003	[There is] the noise of the wailing of the shepherds; for wasted is their glory: [there is] the noise of the roaring of young lions; for wasted is the pride of the Jordan.
038	ZEC	011	004	Thus hath said the Lord my God, Feed the flocks [that are destined for] the slaughter;
038	ZEC	011	005	Whom their buyers slay, and hold themselves guiltless; and whose sellers say, Blessed be the Lord, for I am rich: and none of whose shepherds have pity on them.
038	ZEC	011	006	For I will no more have pity on the inhabitants of the land, saith the Lord: but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into the hand of his neighbor, and into the hand of his king: and they shall beat down the land, and I will not deliver out of their hand.
038	ZEC	011	007	And I had fed the flocks [that were destined for] the slaughter, —indeed, the poorest of the flocks; and I had taken unto me two staves; the one I called Mildness [No'am], and the other I called Concord [Choblim]: and I fed the flocks.
038	ZEC	011	008	And I removed the three shepherds in one month; and my soul was tired of them, and also their soul abhorred me.
038	ZEC	011	009	Then said I, I will not feed you: what is dying may die; and what is to be lost may be lost; and those that are left may eat every one the flesh of the other.
038	ZEC	011	010	And I took my staff, namely, Mildness, and cut it to pieces, to annul my covenant which I had made with all the tribes.
038	ZEC	011	011	And when it was annulled on that day, then knew they well, truly the poorest of the flocks that waited for me, that it was the word of the Lord.
038	ZEC	011	012	And I said unto them, If it be good in your eyes, give me my reward; and if not, forbear. So they weighed out as my reward thirty pieces of silver.
038	ZEC	011	013	And the Lord said unto me, Cast it unto the treasurer, the precious price which I am prized at by them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them in the house of the Lord unto the treasurer.
038	ZEC	011	014	Then I cut in pieces my second staff, namely, Concord, to annul the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
038	ZEC	011	015	And the Lord said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd.
038	ZEC	011	016	For, lo, I raise up a shepherd in the land, who will not think of those that are lost, nor seek for that which is gone astray, nor heal that which hath [a limb] broken; who will not care for that which hath stood still; but who will eat the flesh of the fat, and devour all even to their claws.
038	ZEC	011	017	Woe to the worthless shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall utterly wither, and his right eye shall be completely blinded.
038	ZEC	012	001	The prophecy of the word of the Lord concerning Israel, Saith the Lord, who stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him:
038	ZEC	012	002	Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of confusion unto all the people round about; and also against Judah, who will have to be at the siege against Jerusalem.
038	ZEC	012	003	And it shall come to pass on that day that I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all the people; all that burden themselves with it shall be severely cut: yet then will be gathered together against it all the nations of the earth.
038	ZEC	012	004	On that day, saith the Lord, will I smite every horse with dizziness, and his rider with madness; but over the house of Judah will I open my eyes, while I will smite every horse of the people with blindness.
038	ZEC	012	005	And the chiefs of Judah will say in their heart, A strong support for me are the inhabitants of Jerusalem through the Lord of hosts their God.
038	ZEC	012	006	On that day will I make the chiefs of Judah like a fire-hearth among the wood, and like a torch of fire among sheaves; and they shall devour on the right hand and on the left all the people round about; and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place, even in Jerusalem.
038	ZEC	012	007	The Lord also will save the tents of Judah first: in order that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem shall not become boastful over Judah.
038	ZEC	012	008	On that day will the Lord be a shield around the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and the feeblest among them shall be on that day like David; and the house of David shall be like divine beings, like an angel of the Lord before them.
038	ZEC	012	009	And it shall come to pass on that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that are come against Jerusalem.
038	ZEC	012	010	But I will pour out over the house of David, and over the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they will look up toward me [for every one] whom they have thrust through, and they will lament for him, as one lamenteth for an only son, and weep bitterly for him, as one weepeth bitterly for the first-born.
038	ZEC	012	011	On that day will the lamentation be great in Jerusalem, like the lamentation at Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.
038	ZEC	012	012	And the land will mourn, every family apart by itself: the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart;
038	ZEC	012	013	The family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of Shim'i apart, and their wives apart;
038	ZEC	012	014	All the families that remain, every family apart by itself, and their wives apart.
038	ZEC	013	001	On that day shall there be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for cleansing from sin and for purification.
038	ZEC	013	002	And it shall come to pass on that day, saith the Lord of hosts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall not be remembered any more: and also the prophets and the unclean spirit will I remove out of the land.
038	ZEC	013	003	And it shall come to pass, if any one should yet prophesy, that his father and his mother who have begotten him shall say unto him, Thou shalt not live; for falsely hast thou spoken in the name of the Lord: and his father and his mother who have begotten him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth.
038	ZEC	013	004	And it shall come to pass on that day, that the prophets shall be ashamed every one because of his vision, when he prophesieth; and they shall not clothe themselves with a hairy cloak in order to deceive.
038	ZEC	013	005	But he will say, I am no prophet, a man that tilleth the ground am I; for some one hath taught me to keep cattle from my youth.
038	ZEC	013	006	And should some one say unto him, What are these wounds between thy hands? Then will he say, Those with which I have been wounded in the house of my [vicious] friends.
038	ZEC	013	007	Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man whom I have associated with me, saith the Lord of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered; but I will turn my hand toward the feeble ones.
038	ZEC	013	008	And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith the Lord, two parts [of those] therein shall be cut off, shall perish; but the third part shall be left therein.
038	ZEC	013	009	And I will bring the third part into the fire, and I will refine them as one refineth silver, and will probe them as gold is probed: they will call on my name, and I will answer their prayer; I will say, They arc my people; and they will say, The Lord is my God.
038	ZEC	014	001	Behold, a day is coming unto the Lord, when thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee.
038	ZEC	014	002	And I will assemble all the nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be captured, and the houses plundered, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into exile, and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city.
038	ZEC	014	003	Then will the Lord go forth, and fight against these nations, as on the day when he fought on the day of battle.
038	ZEC	014	004	And his feet will stand on that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall be split in twain in its middle eastward and westward, making a very great valley; and half of the mount shall remove northward, and half of it southward.
038	ZEC	014	005	And ye shall flee [from] the valley of my mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azal; and ye shall flee, just as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of 'Uzziyah the king of Judah: and then will come the Lord my God, and all the saints with thee.
038	ZEC	014	006	And it shall come to pass on that day, that there shall be no light, but fleeting light and thick darkness;
038	ZEC	014	007	But it shall be one particular day which shall indeed be known as the Lord's, neither day nor night; but it shall come to pass, that at evening-time there shall be light.
038	ZEC	014	008	And it shall happen on that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem, the half of them toward the eastern sea, and the other half of them toward the western sea: in summer and in winter shall it be so.
038	ZEC	014	009	And the Lord will be king over all the earth: on that day shall the Lord be [acknowledged] one, and his name be one.
038	ZEC	014	010	All the land shall be changed as it were into a plain from Geba' to Rimmon to the south of Jerusalem; and she herself shall be elevated, and be inhabited on her former site, from the gate of Benjamin unto the place of the first gate, up to the corner gate, and from the tower of Chananel unto the king's wine-presses.
038	ZEC	014	011	And men shall dwell in it, and no destruction shall any more take place; but Jerusalem shall be inhabited in safety.
038	ZEC	014	012	And this shall be the plague wherewith the Lord will afflict all the people that shall have come to battle against Jerusalem: The flesh of every one shall consume away while he standeth upon his feet, and his eyes shall consume away in their holes, and the tongue of every one shall consume away in his mouth.
038	ZEC	014	013	And it shall come to pass on that day, that a great confusion from the Lord shall be among them: and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbor, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbor.
038	ZEC	014	014	And also Judah will have to fight against Jerusalem: and there shall be gathered together the wealth of all the nations round about, gold, and silver, and garments, in great abundance.
038	ZEC	014	015	And thus shall be the plague of the horses, of the mules, of the camels, and of the asses, and of all the beasts that will be in these camps, just like this plague.
038	ZEC	014	016	And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left out of all the nations who will have come against Jerusalem, yea, these shall go up year by year to bow down before the King, the Lord of hosts, and to celebrate the feast of tabernacles.
038	ZEC	014	017	And it shall happen, that whoso will not come up out of the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to bow down before the King, the Lord of hosts, —even upon these there shall be no rain.
038	ZEC	014	018	And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, then shall not [any rain fall] upon them also: this shall be the plague, wherewith the Lord will afflict the nations that will not come up to celebrate the feast of tabernacles.
038	ZEC	014	019	This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations that will not come up to celebrate the feast of tabernacles.
038	ZEC	014	020	On that day shall [every thing], even to the bells of the horses, be holy unto the Lord; and the pots in the Lord's house shall be like the bowls before the altar.
038	ZEC	014	021	And every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holy unto the Lord of hosts; and all those that sacrifice will come and take some of them, and seethe therein: and on that day there shall be no more any trader in the house of the Lord of host.

# BOOK	039	MAL	Malachi	Malachi
039	MAL	001	001	The prophecy of the word of the Lord to Israel by means of Malachi.
039	MAL	001	002	I have loved you, so hath said the Lord: yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Is not Esau brother to Jacob? saith the Lord: yet I loved Jacob;
039	MAL	001	003	And Esau I hated; and I rendered his mountains a desert, and his heritage a dwelling for the monsters of the wilderness.
039	MAL	001	004	Should Edom even say, We are impoverished; but we will return and build the ruined places: thus hath said the Lord of hosts, They may indeed build, but I will surely throw down; and men shall call them, The territory of wickedness, and, The people against whom the Lord hath indignation to eternity.
039	MAL	001	005	And your eyes shall see it; and ye shall then say, The Lord will be magnified beyond the territory of Israel.
039	MAL	001	006	A son honoreth his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is my honor? and if I be a master, where is my fear? saith the Lord of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name; and ye say, wherein have we despised thy name?
039	MAL	001	007	Ye offer upon my altar polluted bread; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the Lord is contemptible.
039	MAL	001	008	And if ye bring near the blind to sacrifice it, is this not evil? and if ye bring near the lame and the sick, is this not evil? do but present it unto thy governor, will he be pleased with thee, or receive thee with favor? saith the Lord of hosts.
039	MAL	001	009	And now, I pray you, beseech the presence of God that he may be gracious unto us; from your hand hath this thing come: will he receive one of you with favor? saith the Lord of hosts.
039	MAL	001	010	Oh that there were some one among you that would lock up the doors [of the sanctuary], that ye might not light up my altar for nought: I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord of hosts, neither will I accept in favor an offering from your hand.
039	MAL	001	011	For from the rising of the sun even unto his going down my name is great among the nations; and in every place incense is burnt and there is offered unto my name, even a pure offering; for great is my name among the nations, saith the Lord of hosts.
039	MAL	001	012	But ye profane it, in that ye say, The table of the Lord is polluted, and by the assertion, Its food is contemptible.
039	MAL	001	013	And ye have said, Behold, what a wearisome task is it! and ye have left it to famish, saith the Lord of hosts; and ye have brought what was robbed, and the lame, and the sick, and thus ye have brought an offering: should I accept this in favor from your hand? saith the Lord.
039	MAL	001	014	But cursed be the deceiver, who hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth a corrupt thing unto the Lord; for I am a great king, saith the Lord of hosts, and my name is feared among the nations.
039	MAL	002	001	And now, this commandment is for you, O ye priests.
039	MAL	002	002	If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith the Lord of hosts: I will even send out against you a curse, and I will curse your blessings; yea, I will curse the same, because ye do not lay it to heart.
039	MAL	002	003	Behold, I will destroy unto you the seed, and spread dung upon your faces, even the dung of your festive offerings; and one shall take you away with it.
039	MAL	002	004	And ye shall thereby know that I have sent out unto you this commandment, that my covenant might be with Levi, saith the Lord of hosts.
039	MAL	002	005	My covenant was with him life and peace; and I gave them to him for the fear wherewith he feared me, and because of my name he had dread.
039	MAL	002	006	The law of truth was in his mouth, and falsehood was not found on his lips: in peace and equity he walked with me, and many did he turn away from iniquity.
039	MAL	002	007	For the priest's lips are ever to keep knowledge, and the law are they to seek from his mouth; for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts.
039	MAL	002	008	But ye are indeed departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble in the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of the Levite, saith the Lord of hosts.
039	MAL	002	009	Therefore have I also made you contemptible and low before all the people, in the same measure as ye do not keep my ways, but act with partiality in the law.
039	MAL	002	010	Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? [then] why shall we deal treacherously every man against his brother, to profane the covenant of our fathers?
039	MAL	002	011	Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination hath been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the sanctuary of the Lord which he loveth, and hath married the daughter of a strange god.
039	MAL	002	012	The Lord will cut off unto the man that doth this, son and grandson, out of the tents of Jacob, and him that bringeth near an offering unto the Lord of hosts.
039	MAL	002	013	And this do ye secondly, covering the altar of the Lord with tears, with weeping and with loud complaint, so that he turneth not any more his regard to the offerings, nor receiveth it with favor at your hand.
039	MAL	002	014	Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the Lord hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast indeed dealt treacherously: yet is she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.
039	MAL	002	015	And not one doth so who hath a remnant of a [good] spirit; for what desireth such a one? he seeketh [to possess] a godly posterity: therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none of you deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.
039	MAL	002	016	For he hateth putting away [the wife], so hath said the Lord the God of Israel, and him who covereth his garment with violence, so hath said the Lord of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, and deal not treacherously.
039	MAL	002	017	Ye have wearied the Lord with your words: yet ye say, Wherein have we wearied him? By your saying, Every one that doth evil is good in the eyes of the Lord, and in them he findeth delight; or else, Where is the God of justice!
039	MAL	003	001	Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall clear out the way before me: and suddenly will come to his temple the Lord, whom ye seek; and the messenger of the covenant, whom ye desire for, behold, he is coming, saith the Lord of hosts.
039	MAL	003	002	But who can sustain the day of his coming? and who can stand when he appeareth? for he is like the fire of the melter, and like the lye of the washers:
039	MAL	003	003	And he will sit as a melter and purifier of silver; and he will purify the sons of Levi, and refine them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness
039	MAL	003	004	And then shall be pleasant unto the Lord the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem, as in the days of old, and as in former years.
039	MAL	003	005	And I will come near unto you to [hold] judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against those that swear falsely, and against those that withhold the wages of the hired laborer, [oppress] the widow, and the fatherless, and that do injustice to the stranger, and fear me not, saith the Lord of hosts.
039	MAL	003	006	For I the Lord, —I have not changed: and ye sons of Jacob—ye have not ceased to be.
039	MAL	003	007	From the days of your fathers did ye depart from my statutes, and did not keep them; return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the Lord of hosts; but ye say, Wherein shall we return?
039	MAL	003	008	Can a man rob God, that ye will rob me? But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and in heave-offerings.
039	MAL	003	009	With the curse are ye cursed, and yet me do ye rob, O ye entire nation!
039	MAL	003	010	Bring ye all the tithes into the store-house, that there may be provision in my house, and prove me but herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open for you the windows of heaven, and pour out for you a blessing, until it be more than enough.
039	MAL	003	011	And I will rebuke for you the devourer, and he shall not destroy for you the fruit of the ground: and the vine shall not cast its fruit for you before the time in the field, saith the Lord of hosts.
039	MAL	003	012	And all the nations shall call you blessed; for ye shall be a land of delight, saith the Lord of hosts.
039	MAL	003	013	Your words have been strong against me, saith the Lord; but ye say, What have we spoken among us against thee?
039	MAL	003	014	Ye have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept his charge, and that we have walked contritely before the Lord of hosts?
039	MAL	003	015	And now we call the presumptuous happy: yea, built up are those that practise wickedness; yea, they have even tempted God and are [yet] suffered to escape.
039	MAL	003	016	Then conversed they that fear the Lord one with the other: and the Lord listened and heard it, and there was written a book of remembrance before him for those who fear the Lord, and for those who respect his name.
039	MAL	003	017	And they shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, on that day which I create as a special treasure: and I will spare them, as a man spareth his son that serveth him.
039	MAL	003	018	And ye shall return, and see the difference between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that hath not served him.
039	MAL	004	001	For, behold, the day is coming, which shall burn as an oven; and all the presumptuous, yea, and all who practise wickedness shall be stubble: and the day that is coming shall set them on fire, saith the Lord of hosts, who will not leave them root or bough.
039	MAL	004	002	But there shall rise unto you that fear my name the sun of righteousness with healing in his wings: and ye will go forth, and grow fat as calves of the stall.
039	MAL	004	003	And ye will tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet, on the day that I create, saith the Lord of hosts.
039	MAL	004	004	Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, whom I commanded on Horeb for all Israel, statutes and ordinances.
039	MAL	004	005	Behold, I send unto you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the day of the Lord, the great and the dreadful.
039	MAL	004	006	And he shall turn back the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers: lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.
