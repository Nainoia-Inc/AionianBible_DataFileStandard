# BOOK	040	MAT	Matthew	Matthew
040	MAT	001	001	THE book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
040	MAT	001	002	Abraham begat Isaac, and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren,
040	MAT	001	003	and Judas begat Phares, and Zara of Thamar, and Phares begat Esrom, and Esrom begat Aram;
040	MAT	001	004	and Aram begat Amminadab, and Amminadab begat Naasson, and Naasson begat Salmon,
040	MAT	001	005	and Salmon begat Boaz of Rachab, and Boaz begat Obed of Ruth, and Obed begat Jesse,
040	MAT	001	006	and Jesse begat David the king, and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias,
040	MAT	001	007	and Solomon begat Roboam, and Roboam begat Abia, and Abia begat Asa,
040	MAT	001	008	and Asa begat Josaphat, and Josaphat begat Joram, and Joram begat Ozias,
040	MAT	001	009	and Ozias begat Joatham, and Joatham begat Ahaz, and Ahaz begat Hezekias,
040	MAT	001	010	and Hezekias begat Manasses, and Manasses begat Amon, and Amon begat Josias,
040	MAT	001	011	and Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon,
040	MAT	001	012	and after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel, and Salathiel begat Zorobabel,
040	MAT	001	013	and Zorobabel begat Abiud, and Abiud begat Eliakim, and Eliakim begat Azor,
040	MAT	001	014	and Azor begat Sadoc, and Sadoc begat Achim, and Achim begat Eliud,
040	MAT	001	015	and Eliud begat Eleazar, and Eleazar begat Matthan, and Matthan begat Jacob,
040	MAT	001	016	and Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom is born Jesus, who is called Christ.
040	MAT	001	017	So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, and from David to the carrying away into Babylon fourteen generations, and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ fourteen generations.
040	MAT	001	018	Now the generation of Jesus Christ was attended with these circumstances: His mother Mary being betrothed to Joseph, before they cohabited together, she was found with child from the Holy Spirit.
040	MAT	001	019	Then Joseph her husband being a just man, and not willing to expose her publicly, designed to put her away privately.
040	MAT	001	020	And as he was revolving the matter in his mind, behold, an angel of the Lord in a dream appeared unto him, saying, Joseph, son of David, fear not to take Mary for thy wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
040	MAT	001	021	And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.
040	MAT	001	022	Now the whole of this was done, that what was spoken of the Lord, by the prophet, might be fulfilled, saying,
040	MAT	001	023	“A virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel,” which is being interpreted, God with us.
040	MAT	001	024	Then Joseph when arisen from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took his wife;
040	MAT	001	025	and he knew her not, until she had brought forth her son, the first begotten, and he called his name Jesus.
040	MAT	002	001	NOW when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, lo! Magians from the East came to Jerusalem,
040	MAT	002	002	saying, Where is he that is born king of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the East, and are come to pay him homage.
040	MAT	002	003	Now when Herod the king heard this, he was much agitated, and all Jerusalem with him.
040	MAT	002	004	And assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he enquired of them, where the Messiah should be born.
040	MAT	002	005	Then they answered him, In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written by the prophet,
040	MAT	002	006	“And thou Bethlehem, land of Judah, art in no respect the least amongst the princes of Judah, for from thee shall go forth the Ruler, who shall conduct my people Israel.”
040	MAT	002	007	Thereupon Herod secretly calling to him the Magians, enquired very particularly of them the time of the star’s appearing,
040	MAT	002	008	and sending them to Bethlehem said, Go, and procure the most exact information respecting this child; and when you have found him, bring me intelligence, that I may come, and pay him homage also.
040	MAT	002	009	So having heard the king, they went on; and lo, the star, which they had seen in the East, had gone before them, till it came and stood over the place where the infant was.
040	MAT	002	010	And when they saw the star, they were exceedingly transported with joy.
040	MAT	002	011	And coming into the house, they found the infant with Mary his mother, and falling prostrate, they paid their homage to him. And opening their treasures, they made their offerings to him, gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.
040	MAT	002	012	And having received warning in a dream not to go back to Herod, they departed into their own country by another road.
040	MAT	002	013	Now when they were gone, behold an angel of the Lord appeared unto Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the infant and his mother by night, and flee into Egypt, and stay there, till I speak to thee, for Herod will search for the infant to destroy it.
040	MAT	002	014	So rising up, he took the babe and his mother by night, and retired into Egypt,
040	MAT	002	015	and was there till the death of Herod; that what was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, might be fulfilled, saying, “Out of Egypt have I called my son.”
040	MAT	002	016	Then Herod, perceiving that he was treated delusively by the Magians, was greatly exasperated, and he sent and slew all the male infants, that were in Bethlehem, and in all its territories, from their entering their second year and all under it, according to the time, which he had accurately enquired from the Magians.
040	MAT	002	017	Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
040	MAT	002	018	“A cry was heard at Ramah, lamentation, and wailing, and bitter moaning, Rachel weeping for her children, and will not be comforted, because they are no more.”
040	MAT	002	019	Now when Herod was dead, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
040	MAT	002	020	saying, Arise, and take the little boy and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they who sought the life of the infant are dead.
040	MAT	002	021	So he arose, and took the child and his mother, and came unto the land of Israel.
040	MAT	002	022	But hearing that Archelaus reigned in Judea in the stead of Herod his father, he was afraid to go thither. And being divinely warned in a dream, he retired into the country of Galilee,
040	MAT	002	023	and came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that what was said by the prophets might be fulfilled, that he shall be called a Nazarean.
040	MAT	003	001	THEN in those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the desert country of Judea,
040	MAT	003	002	and saying, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is nigh.
040	MAT	003	003	For this is the person spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying, “The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths strait.”
040	MAT	003	004	Now this John had his garment made of camel’s hair, and a girdle of leather about his loins, and his food was locusts and wild honey.
040	MAT	003	005	Then went out to him Jerusalem and all Judea, and all the regions about Jordan,
040	MAT	003	006	and were baptized by him in Jordan, on making confession of their sins.
040	MAT	003	007	But when he saw many of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, O ye broods of vipers! who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
040	MAT	003	008	Produce then worthy fruits of repentance:
040	MAT	003	009	and think not to say in yourselves, We have Abraham for our father: for I say unto you, that God is able out of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.
040	MAT	003	010	And now also the ax is laid to the root of the trees: every tree therefore which produceth not good fruit, is hewing down, and casting into the fire.
040	MAT	003	011	I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry: he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit, and with fire:
040	MAT	003	012	whose winnowing fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor, and will collect the wheat into his granary; but the chaff will he burn up with fire unquenchable.
040	MAT	003	013	Then came Jesus from Galilee unto Jordan to John, that he might be baptized by him.
040	MAT	003	014	But John earnestly withheld him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?
040	MAT	003	015	But Jesus answering said unto him, Permit it to be so now, for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he permitted him.
040	MAT	003	016	And Jesus, after his baptism, came straight from the water: and lo! the heavens were opened for him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as it were a dove, and coming upon him:
040	MAT	003	017	and lo! a voice from the heavens, saying, This is my Son, the beloved, in whom is my delight.
040	MAT	004	001	THEN was Jesus led away by the spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted by the devil.
040	MAT	004	002	And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards he became hungry.
040	MAT	004	003	And the tempter coming to him said, If thou art the Son of God, command that these stones be made loaves.
040	MAT	004	004	But he answering said, It is written, “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.”
040	MAT	004	005	Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and placed him on a wing of the temple,
040	MAT	004	006	and saith to him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, “that he shall give his angels a charge concerning thee: and in their hands shall they hold thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.”
040	MAT	004	007	Jesus said unto him, It is written again, “Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.”
040	MAT	004	008	Again the devil taketh him unto an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory;
040	MAT	004	009	and saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall prostrate and worship me.
040	MAT	004	010	Then saith Jesus unto him, Avaunt Satan! for it is written, “Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and to him only thou pay divine adoration.”
040	MAT	004	011	Then the devil leaveth him, and lo! angels came and ministered unto him.
040	MAT	004	012	But when Jesus heard that John was cast into prison, he retired into Galilee;
040	MAT	004	013	and leaving Nazareth, he came and resided at Capernaum, a maritime city, on the confines of Zebulun and Nephthali:
040	MAT	004	014	that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled, saying,
040	MAT	004	015	“The land of Zabulun, and the land of Naphthali, the road to the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;
040	MAT	004	016	the people who sat in darkness saw a great light; and on those who sat in the region and shadow of death, even on them hath the light arisen.”
040	MAT	004	017	From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is approaching.
040	MAT	004	018	And as Jesus was walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
040	MAT	004	019	And he saith to them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.
040	MAT	004	020	Then immediately quitting their nets they followed him.
040	MAT	004	021	And going on from thence, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.
040	MAT	004	022	Then they instantly quitting the ship and their father, followed him.
040	MAT	004	023	And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every malady among the people.
040	MAT	004	024	And there went out a report of him into all Syria: and they brought unto him all who had illness, the afflicted with various diseases and painful complaints, and the demoniacs, and lunatics, and paralytics; and he healed them.
040	MAT	004	025	And great multitudes followed him from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and from beyond Jordan.
040	MAT	005	001	THEN seeing the multitudes, he went up into the mountain: and seating himself, his disciples came to him:
040	MAT	005	002	and opening his mouth, he taught them, saying,
040	MAT	005	003	Blessed are the poor in spirit, for their’s is the kingdom of heaven.
040	MAT	005	004	Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.
040	MAT	005	005	Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
040	MAT	005	006	Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be fed to the full.
040	MAT	005	007	Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy.
040	MAT	005	008	Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
040	MAT	005	009	Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.
040	MAT	005	010	Blessed are they who are persecuted for righteousness sake: for their’s is the kingdom in heaven.
040	MAT	005	011	Blessed are ye, when they shall revile and persecute you, and lying, speak every thing evil against you for my sake.
040	MAT	005	012	Rejoice and exult; for plenteous is your reward in the heavens: for just so they persecuted the prophets who went before you.
040	MAT	005	013	Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt become insipid, with what can it be salted? it is of no farther use for any purpose, but to be cast out, and trodden under foot of men.
040	MAT	005	014	Ye are the light of the world. A city cannot be hid that is situated on an eminence.
040	MAT	005	015	Neither do men burn a lamp, and set it under a bushel, but on its stand; and it sheds light on all that are in the house.
040	MAT	005	016	Just so let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in the heavens.
040	MAT	005	017	Think not that I am come to destroy the law and the prophets: I came not to destroy, but to fulfil.
040	MAT	005	018	For I tell you assuredly, that till heaven and earth pass away, not one iota, or the smallest stroke of a letter, shall pass from the law, until all things shall be accomplished.
040	MAT	005	019	Whosoever therefore shall break one of the least of these commandments, and teach men so, he shall be accounted the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall practise, and teach them, he shall be reckoned great in the kingdom of heaven.
040	MAT	005	020	For I say unto you, That except your righteousness abounds more than that of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven.
040	MAT	005	021	Ye have heard that it was said to the men of antient times, “Thou shalt do no murder;” and whosoever shall commit murder, shall be liable to the judgment:
040	MAT	005	022	but I say unto you, That every man who is angry with his brother without cause, shall be liable to the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be liable to the sanhedrim: but whosever shall say, Thou fool, shall be liable to be cast into hell fire.
040	MAT	005	023	If therefore thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;
040	MAT	005	024	leave there thy gift before the altar, and go: first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.
040	MAT	005	025	Be disposed to agree with thy prosecutor speedily, whilst thou art in the way with him to the bar; lest the prosecutor deliver thee up to the judge, and the judge commit thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.
040	MAT	005	026	Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt in no wise come out from thence, till thou hast paid the last farthing.
040	MAT	005	027	Ye have heard that it was said to those of old, “Thou shalt not commit adultery:”
040	MAT	005	028	but I say unto you, That every one who looketh upon a woman to lust after her, hath already committed adultery with her in his heart.
040	MAT	005	029	If then thine eye, the right, leads thee to offend, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is highly for thy advantage, that one of thy members be destroyed, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.
040	MAT	005	030	And if thy right hand leads thee to offend, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is highly thy interest that one of thy members should be destroyed, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.
040	MAT	005	031	It hath been said indeed, That whosoever will put away his wife, let him give her a bill of divorce:
040	MAT	005	032	But I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except on account of whoredom, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is put away, committeth adultery.
040	MAT	005	033	Again ye have heard that it was said to those of old, “Thou shalt not perjure thyself, but shalt perform to the Lord thine oaths:”
040	MAT	005	034	But I say to thee, Swear not at all; neither by the heaven; for it is the throne of God:
040	MAT	005	035	nor by the earth; for it is the footstool of his feet: nor by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King:
040	MAT	005	036	neither shalt thou swear by thy head, for thou canst not make one hair white or black.
040	MAT	005	037	But let your discourse be, Yea, yea; No, no: for all addition to these is from the wicked one.
040	MAT	005	038	Ye have heard that it was said, “Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth:”
040	MAT	005	039	but I say unto you, Resist not an injurious act; but whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek, turn to him also the other.
040	MAT	005	040	And if a man will prosecute thee, and take thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.
040	MAT	005	041	And whosoever shall press thee for one mile, go with him two.
040	MAT	005	042	Give to him that asketh thee; and from him who wants to borrow of thee, turn not away.
040	MAT	005	043	Ye have heard that it hath been said, “Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.”
040	MAT	005	044	But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who treat you insolently, and persecute you;
040	MAT	005	045	that ye may be the children of your Father who is in heaven: for he causeth his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and tendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.
040	MAT	005	046	For if ye love those who love you, what reward have you? do not even the publicans the same thing?
040	MAT	005	047	And if ye embrace your brethren only, what do ye extraordinary? do not even the publicans so?
040	MAT	005	048	Be ye therefore perfect, as your Father who is in heaven is perfect.
040	MAT	006	001	TAKE heed that ye do not your alms before men, in order to catch their eye: for otherwise ye have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.
040	MAT	006	002	Therefore when thou givest alms, sound not a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do, in the synagogues, and in the streets, that they may have glory from men. Verily I say unto you, They receive their reward.
040	MAT	006	003	But when thou givest alms, let not thy right hand know what thy left is doing:
040	MAT	006	004	that thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father who seeth in secret, will himself reward thee openly.
040	MAT	006	005	And when thou prayest, be not as the hypocrites: for they love standing in the synagogues and at the corners of the streets, to pray, that they may make a shew to men. Verily I say unto you, That they have their reward.
040	MAT	006	006	But when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and shut thy door, to pray to thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father who seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.
040	MAT	006	007	And when thou art at prayer, use not vain repetitions, like the heathen: for they imagine that they shall be heard for their much speaking.
040	MAT	006	008	Be not ye therefore like them: for your Father knoweth of what things ye have need, before you ask him.
040	MAT	006	009	Thus then pray ye: Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
040	MAT	006	010	Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.
040	MAT	006	011	Give us this day our daily bread.
040	MAT	006	012	And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.
040	MAT	006	013	And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil: for thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen!
040	MAT	006	014	For if ye forgive men their offences, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:
040	MAT	006	015	but if ye forgive not to men their offences, neither will your Father forgive your offences.
040	MAT	006	016	And when ye fast, be not as the hypocrites, affecting a gloomy look: for they disfigure their visages, that they may make a shew of fasting to men. Verily I say unto you, That they have their reward.
040	MAT	006	017	But when thou keepest a fast, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;
040	MAT	006	018	that thou mayest not make a shew of fasting to men, but to thy Father who is in secret: and thy Father who seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.
040	MAT	006	019	Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where the rust and canker spoil, and where thieves dig through and steal:
040	MAT	006	020	but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither rust nor canker spoil, and where thieves do not dig through and steal;
040	MAT	006	021	for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
040	MAT	006	022	The lamp of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be transparent, thy whole body shall be enlightened.
040	MAT	006	023	But if thine eye be vitiated, thy whole body will be darkened. If therefore the light which is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!
040	MAT	006	024	No man can serve two masters: for he will either hate the one, and love the other; or he will adhere to the one, and disregard the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
040	MAT	006	025	For this cause I tell you, Be not anxious about your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life of more value than meat, and the body than raiment?
040	MAT	006	026	Look on the birds of the air: for they neither sow, nor reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are you not of more value than they?
040	MAT	006	027	But which of you, by his cares, can add one cubit to his stature?
040	MAT	006	028	And why are ye anxious about clothing? Contemplate the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, nor spin:
040	MAT	006	029	yet I tell you, Not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these.
040	MAT	006	030	If God then so clothe a vegetable of the field, which to-day is, in beauty, and tomorrow is cast into the furnace, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?
040	MAT	006	031	Wherefore be under no anxiety, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, With what shall we be clothed?
040	MAT	006	032	(for after all these things the heathen seek: ) and your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of them all.
040	MAT	006	033	But seek ye, in the first place, the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be given you over.
040	MAT	006	034	Be not therefore anxious about to-morrow: for tomorrow will provide for its own wants. Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.
040	MAT	007	001	JUDGE not, that ye be not judged.
040	MAT	007	002	For with the same judgment ye judge others, shall ye be judged: and with the measure ye mete, shall it be measured to you again.
040	MAT	007	003	And why spiest thou out the mote which is in thy brother’s eye, yet payest no attention to the beam which is in thine own eye?
040	MAT	007	004	Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Suffer me to take the mote off from thine eye: and behold there is a beam in thine own eye?
040	MAT	007	005	Thou hypocrite, take first the beam out of thine own eye and then shalt thou see clearly to take off the mote from thy brother’s eye.
040	MAT	007	006	Give not that which is holy to dogs, nor cast pearls before swine; lest they tread them under foot, and turning round tear you.
040	MAT	007	007	Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:
040	MAT	007	008	for every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
040	MAT	007	009	What man is there of you, of whom if his son ask a loaf, will he give him a stone?
040	MAT	007	010	or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?
040	MAT	007	011	If ye then, evil as ye are, know how to bestow good gifts on your children; how much more will your Father who is in heaven, bestow good things on those who ask him?
040	MAT	007	012	All things therefore whatsoever ye would be willing that men should do to you, just so do ye to them: for this is the law and the prophets.
040	MAT	007	013	Enter in through the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and spacious the road, which leadeth to perdition, and they are many who enter that way:
040	MAT	007	014	because strait is the gate, and narrow the road, which leadeth to life, and they are but a few who find it.
040	MAT	007	015	Take heed then of false prophets, who come to you in the garb of sheep, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
040	MAT	007	016	By their fruits ye shall know them. Do men gather a bunch of grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?
040	MAT	007	017	So every good tree beareth good fruits; but every bad tree in kind, produceth bad fruits.
040	MAT	007	018	A good tree cannot produce bad fruits, neither can a tree bad in kind produce good fruits.
040	MAT	007	019	Every tree that beareth not good fruit, is cut down, and cast into the fire.
040	MAT	007	020	Well then! by their fruits ye shall know them.
040	MAT	007	021	Not every one who saith to me, Lord, Lord! shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven.
040	MAT	007	022	Many will say unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have we not cast out devils? and in thy name done many miracles?
040	MAT	007	023	And then will I profess unto them, that I never knew you: depart from me, ye workers of iniquity.
040	MAT	007	024	Every man therefore who is hearing from me these words, and puts them in practice, I will compare him to the intelligent man, who erected his house upon a rock:
040	MAT	007	025	and the rain descended, and the rivers rushed, and the winds blew, and they beat against that house, and it fell not; for it was founded on a rock.
040	MAT	007	026	And every man who is hearing these sayings of mine, and doth not practise them, he will resemble the foolish man, who built his house upon the sand:
040	MAT	007	027	and the rain descended, and the rivers rushed, and the winds blew, and set against that house, and it fell; and the fall of it was great.
040	MAT	007	028	And it was so, that when Jesus had concluded all these sayings, the multitudes were exceedingly struck with his teaching:
040	MAT	007	029	for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.
040	MAT	008	001	NOW when he descended from the mount, great multitudes followed him.
040	MAT	008	002	And lo! a leper came and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
040	MAT	008	003	And stretching out his hand, Jesus touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And instantly the leprosy was cleansed.
040	MAT	008	004	And Jesus said to him, See thou tell no man; but go, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift which Moses commanded for a testimony unto them.
040	MAT	008	005	Then as Jesus was entering into Capernaum, there met him a centurion, intreating him,
040	MAT	008	006	and saying, My servant is lying in the house paralytic, terribly tormented with pain.
040	MAT	008	007	And Jesus said unto him, I will come and heal him.
040	MAT	008	008	And the centurion said, I am not a fit person, that thou shouldest come under my roof: but only speak a word, and my servant be cured.
040	MAT	008	009	For I also am a man under authority, having under my command soldiers and I say to this soldier, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.
040	MAT	008	010	And Jesus hearing him, marvelled, and said to those who were following, Verily I say unto you, not even in Israel have I found so great faith.
040	MAT	008	011	And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and from the west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.
040	MAT	008	012	But the children of the kingdom shall be cast into the outer darkness: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
040	MAT	008	013	And Jesus said to the centurion, Go; and as thou hast believed, be it to thee. And his servant was cured at that very hour.
040	MAT	008	014	And when Jesus was come into the house of Peter, he saw his mother-in-law laid on a bed, and in a fever.
040	MAT	008	015	And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and waited upon them.
040	MAT	008	016	And when evening was come, they brought him many possessed by devils: and he cast out the spirits by a word, and all who had illnesses he cured:
040	MAT	008	017	that it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet, “Himself he took our infirmities, and bore our diseases.”
040	MAT	008	018	Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave orders to pass to the other side.
040	MAT	008	019	And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.
040	MAT	008	020	And Jesus said unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where he can lay his head.
040	MAT	008	021	And another of his disciples said unto him, Permit me first to go and bury my father.
040	MAT	008	022	And Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their own dead.
040	MAT	008	023	And going on board a vessel, his disciples followed him.
040	MAT	008	024	And, behold, there was a great tempest in the sea, so that the vessel was hid by the waves; but he was asleep.
040	MAT	008	025	And his disciples coming, awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we are perishing!
040	MAT	008	026	And he said unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then arising, he issued his mandate to the winds, and to the sea; and there was a great calm.
040	MAT	008	027	And the men marvelled, saying, What a wondrous man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!
040	MAT	008	028	And when he came to the other side, into the region of the Girgasenes, there met him two demoniacs, coming from the sepulchres; exceeding fierce, so that no person was able to pass by that road.
040	MAT	008	029	And lo! they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither before the time to torment us?
040	MAT	008	030	And at a considerable distance, there was a great herd of swine feeding.
040	MAT	008	031	Then the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, permit us to go into the herd of swine.
040	MAT	008	032	And he said to them, Go. Then they going forth out of him, entered into the herd of swine: and lo! the whole herd of the swine rushed down a precipice into the sea, and perished in the waters.
040	MAT	008	033	But they who fed them fled, and going away into the city, reported all things, and what had happened to the demoniacs.
040	MAT	008	034	And, behold, all the city came out to meet him: and when they saw him, they besought him to depart from their territories.
040	MAT	009	001	AND going on board the vessel, he passed over, and came to his own city.
040	MAT	009	002	And lo! they brought him a paralytic stretched on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said to the paralytic, Be of good cheer, son; thy sins are forgiven thee.
040	MAT	009	003	And lo! some of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemeth.
040	MAT	009	004	And Jesus, seeing their thoughts, said, wherefore do ye imagine evil things in your hearts?
040	MAT	009	005	For which is the easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and walk?
040	MAT	009	006	But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority upon earth to forgive sins, (then he saith to the paralytic, ) Arise, take up thy bed, and go into thy house.
040	MAT	009	007	And he arose, and went to his house.
040	MAT	009	008	But when the multitude saw it, they were astonished, and glorified God, who had given such power unto men.
040	MAT	009	009	And Jesus passing from thence, saw a man sitting at the custom house, called Matthew: and saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.
040	MAT	009	010	And it came to pass, as he sat in his house, many tax-gatherers and sinners came, and sat down at table with Jesus and his disciples.
040	MAT	009	011	And the Pharisees observing it, said to his disciples, How is this, that your Master eateth with publicans and sinners?
040	MAT	009	012	But Jesus hearing it, said unto them, They who are in the vigour of health have no need of the physician, but they who have illness.
040	MAT	009	013	Go then, and learn what is said, “I require mercy and not sacrifice:” for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
040	MAT	009	014	Then came unto him disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees keep many fasts, but thy disciples fast not?
040	MAT	009	015	And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber weep, whilst the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then will they fast.
040	MAT	009	016	But no man ingrafts a patch of undressed cloth into an old garment, for the piece supplied taketh from the garment, and the rent becomes worse.
040	MAT	009	017	Nor do they put new wine into old bottles: but if they do, the bottles burst, and the wine is spilt, and the bottles are destroyed: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.
040	MAT	009	018	As he was speaking these things to them, behold, there came a ruler, and prostrated himself before him, saying, My daughter hath just now died: but come and lay thine hand upon her, and she shall live.
040	MAT	009	019	And Jesus arose, and followed him, and his disciples also.
040	MAT	009	020	And, behold, a woman, who had an haemorrage twelve years, came behind, and touched the fringe of his garment:
040	MAT	009	021	for she said within herself, If I only touch his garment, I shall be cured.
040	MAT	009	022	Then Jesus, turning about and beholding her, said, Be encouraged, daughter; thy faith hath saved thee. And the woman was cured from that hour.
040	MAT	009	023	And when Jesus was come into the ruler’s house, and saw the flute-players, and a multitude confusedly lamenting,
040	MAT	009	024	he saith to them, Retire; for the little girl is not dead, but sleeping. And they derided him.
040	MAT	009	025	So when the multitude was put out, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the little girl arose.
040	MAT	009	026	And the fame of it went forth into all that country.
040	MAT	009	027	And as Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him, crying out, and saying, Have mercy on us, son of David!
040	MAT	009	028	So when he came into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus said to them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yes, Lord.
040	MAT	009	029	Then he touched their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you.
040	MAT	009	030	And their eyes were opened; and Jesus strictly charged them, saying, Take care that no person know it.
040	MAT	009	031	But they going forth, blazoned his fame through all that country.
040	MAT	009	032	And when they were coming out, behold, they brought unto him a man, dumb, a demoniac.
040	MAT	009	033	And when the devil was cast out, the dumb man spoke: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, Never at any time was the like to this seen in Israel.
040	MAT	009	034	But the Pharisees said, By the prince of the devils doth he cast the devils out.
040	MAT	009	035	And Jesus took a circuit through all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of disease, and every malady among the people.
040	MAT	009	036	And beholding the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them, because they were fainting, and lying here and there, as sheep that had no shepherd.
040	MAT	009	037	Then said he to his disciples, The harvest indeed is abundant, but the labourers are few;
040	MAT	009	038	entreat therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth workmen for his harvest.
040	MAT	010	001	AND having called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to cure every disease, and every malady.
040	MAT	010	002	Now these are the names of the twelve apostles; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James son of Zebedee, and John his brother;
040	MAT	010	003	Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the tax-gatherer; James son of Alpheus, and Lebbeus, whose surname is Thaddeus;
040	MAT	010	004	Simon the Cananite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
040	MAT	010	005	These twelve did Jesus send forth, commanding them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter not:
040	MAT	010	006	but go rather to the sheep that are lost of the house of Israel.
040	MAT	010	007	And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is approaching.
040	MAT	010	008	Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.
040	MAT	010	009	Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,
040	MAT	010	010	nor a scrip for the journey, nor two coats, nor sandals, nor stick: for the workman is worthy of his food.
040	MAT	010	011	And into whatsoever city or village ye enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye depart.
040	MAT	010	012	And when ye come into a family, salute it:
040	MAT	010	013	and if the family shall be deserving, your peace shall come upon it: and if it be not deserving, your peace shall return to you.
040	MAT	010	014	And whosoever shall not receive you, nor attend to your discourses, go out of that house, or city, and shake off the dust of your feet.
040	MAT	010	015	Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.
040	MAT	010	016	Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore prudent as serpents, and harmless as doves.
040	MAT	010	017	But be on your guard against men: for they will deliver you up to the sanhedrim, and scourge you in their synagogues.
040	MAT	010	018	And ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the heathen.
040	MAT	010	019	But when they shall deliver you up, be under no anxiety what ye shall say; for it shall be given you in that very hour what ye should speak:
040	MAT	010	020	for it is not you who are speaking, but the Spirit of your Father which is speaking in you.
040	MAT	010	021	Then brother shall surrender brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death.
040	MAT	010	022	And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake: but he that endureth to the end, that man shall be saved.
040	MAT	010	023	But when they shall persecute you in one city, flee unto another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not complete your circuit through the cities of Israel before the Son of man comes.
040	MAT	010	024	The disciple is not superior to his teacher, nor the servant above his master.
040	MAT	010	025	It is sufficient if the disciple be as his teacher, and the servant as his master. If they have called the master of the family Beelzebub, how much more his domestics?
040	MAT	010	026	However, fear them not: for there is nothing concealed, which shall not be discovered; nor hid, which shall not be known.
040	MAT	010	027	What I say unto you in the dark, publish in the light: and what ye hear whispered into the ear, proclaim upon the roofs.
040	MAT	010	028	And be not afraid of those who kill the body, and cannot kill the soul: but fear him rather who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
040	MAT	010	029	Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall to the ground without your Father.
040	MAT	010	030	But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.
040	MAT	010	031	Fear not, therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.
040	MAT	010	032	Every one therefore who shall make confession of me before men, of him will I also make confession before my Father who is in heaven.
040	MAT	010	033	But whosoever shall disown me before men, him will I also disown before my Father who is in heaven.
040	MAT	010	034	Think not that I am come to bring peace to the earth: I came not to bring peace, but a sword.
040	MAT	010	035	For I came to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
040	MAT	010	036	And the enemies of a man shall be those of his own house.
040	MAT	010	037	He that loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me, is not worthy of me.
040	MAT	010	038	And he that taketh not up his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.
040	MAT	010	039	He that preserveth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall preserve it.
040	MAT	010	040	He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.
040	MAT	010	041	He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet, shall receive the reward of a prophet; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, shall receive the reward of a righteous man.
040	MAT	010	042	And whosoever shall give to one of these little ones, if but a cup of cold water to drink, in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.
040	MAT	011	001	AND it came to pass, when Jesus had finished his injunctions to his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and preach in their cities.
040	MAT	011	002	Then John, having heard in prison the works of Christ, sent two of his disciples,
040	MAT	011	003	and said unto him, Art thou he that cometh, or should we expect another?
040	MAT	011	004	And Jesus answering said unto them, Go, and tell John what things ye hear and see.
040	MAT	011	005	The blind receive sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.
040	MAT	011	006	And blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended at me.
040	MAT	011	007	And when they were gone, Jesus began to speak to the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?
040	MAT	011	008	But what went ye out to see? A man clothed in delicate garments? Lo! they who wear delicate garments are in the houses of kings.
040	MAT	011	009	Yet what went ye out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and abundantly more than a prophet.
040	MAT	011	010	For this is he of whom it is written, “Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.”
040	MAT	011	011	Verily I say unto you, There hath not arisen, from those born of women, a greater than John the Baptist: yet he that is the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.
040	MAT	011	012	But from the days of John the Baptist unto the present, the kingdom of heaven is assaulted by violence, and the invaders forcibly seize upon it.
040	MAT	011	013	For all the prophets and the law until John, foretold this.
040	MAT	011	014	And if ye will receive it, this is Elias who was to come.
040	MAT	011	015	He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
040	MAT	011	016	But to whom shall I resemble this generation? it is like little boys sitting in the places of concourse, and calling to their companions,
040	MAT	011	017	and saying, We have piped to you, and ye have not danced; we have sung mournful ditties to you, and ye have not beat your breasts.
040	MAT	011	018	For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil:
040	MAT	011	019	the Son of man is come eating and drinking, and they say, Behold, what a man! a glutton and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and sinners: though wisdom hath been justified by her children.
040	MAT	011	020	Then began he to upbraid the cities in which the chief of his miracles had been wrought, because they repented not:
040	MAT	011	021	Wo unto thee, Chorazin! wo unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the miracles which had been wrought in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, long since would they have repented in sack-cloth and ashes.
040	MAT	011	022	Wherefore I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you.
040	MAT	011	023	And thou, Capernaum, who hast been exalted unto heaven, shalt be cast down to hell: for if the miracles which have been wrought in thee had been done in Sodom, it had remained unto this day.
040	MAT	011	024	Wherefore I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for thee.
040	MAT	011	025	At that time Jesus spake and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and the intelligent, and hast revealed them to babes:
040	MAT	011	026	yes, Father! since such is thy good pleasure.
040	MAT	011	027	All things are delivered up to me by my Father: and no person knoweth the Son but the Father; neither knoweth any person the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son is pleased to reveal him.
040	MAT	011	028	Come to me, all who labour hard, and sustain heavy burdens, and I will give you relief.
040	MAT	011	029	Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest to your souls.
040	MAT	011	030	For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
040	MAT	012	001	AT that time Jesus walked through corn-fields on a sabbath-day; and his disciples were hungry, and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat.
040	MAT	012	002	But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, Behold, thy disciples do a thing that it is not lawful to do on the sabbath.
040	MAT	012	003	And he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was hungry, and they who were with him?
040	MAT	012	004	how they went into the house of God, and did eat the loaves of shew-bread, of which it was not lawful for him or those who were with him to eat, but for the priests alone?
040	MAT	012	005	Or have ye not read in the law, that on the sabbaths the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are not culpable?
040	MAT	012	006	Now I tell you, That one greater than the temple is here.
040	MAT	012	007	But if ye had known what that meant, I desire mercy and not sacrifice; ye would not have condemned the innocent.
040	MAT	012	008	For the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.
040	MAT	012	009	And going on from thence, he came into their synagogue;
040	MAT	012	010	and, behold a man was there who had a withered hand. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on sabbath days? that they might accuse him.
040	MAT	012	011	Then he said to them; What man of you is there who hath one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath, doth he not lay hold on him, and lift him out?
040	MAT	012	012	Of how much more value then is a man than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do good on the sabbath days.
040	MAT	012	013	Then saith he to the man, Stretch out thy hand; and he stretched it out, and it was restored, sound as the other.
040	MAT	012	014	Then the Pharisees went out, and held a consultation against him, how they might make away with him.
040	MAT	012	015	But Jesus knew it, and retired from thence, and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all,
040	MAT	012	016	and charged them that they should not make him known.
040	MAT	012	017	That what was spoken by Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, saying,
040	MAT	012	018	“Behold, my servant, whom I have chosen, my beloved, in whom my soul delighteth: I will put my Spirit upon him, and he shall proclaim judgment for the heathen.
040	MAT	012	019	He shall not contend, nor be clamorous; neither shall any man in the streets hear his voice.
040	MAT	012	020	A bruised reed shall he not break down, and smoking flax shall he not quench, until he break forth in judgment for victory.
040	MAT	012	021	And in his name shall the Gentiles hope.”
040	MAT	012	022	Then was brought to him a demoniac, blind and dumb; and he cured him, so as to enable the blind and dumb both to speak and see.
040	MAT	012	023	And all the multitudes were lost in amazement, and they said, Is not this the son of David?
040	MAT	012	024	But the Pharisees hearing them, said, This fellow casteth not out devils, but by Beelzebub, the prince of the devils.
040	MAT	012	025	But Jesus knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself will be desolated; and every city, or family, divided against itself cannot subsist:
040	MAT	012	026	so if Satan cast out Satan; he is divided against himself; how then can his kingdom subsist?
040	MAT	012	027	And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.
040	MAT	012	028	But if I by the Spirit of God cast out the devils, then truly the kingdom of God is come unto you.
040	MAT	012	029	Else how can one enter into a strong man’s house and plunder his goods, except he first bind the strong man, and then will he plunder his goods?
040	MAT	012	030	He that is not with me, is against me; and he that associates not with me, scattereth abroad.
040	MAT	012	031	Therefore I say unto you, All sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven to men; but the blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven to men.
040	MAT	012	032	And whosoever may speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever shall speak against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in the world to come.
040	MAT	012	033	Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by the fruit.
040	MAT	012	034	Ye broods of vipers, how can ye speak good things, yourselves being wicked? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.
040	MAT	012	035	A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things: and a wicked man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth evil things.
040	MAT	012	036	But I tell you, That every idle word which men speak, for it shall they give an account in the day of judgment.
040	MAT	012	037	For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.
040	MAT	012	038	Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees addressed him, saying, Master, we desire to see a sign from thee.
040	MAT	012	039	But he answered and said unto them, A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh a sign; and no sign shall be given it, but the sign of Jonah the prophet:
040	MAT	012	040	for as Jonah was in the belly of the whale three days and three nights; so shall the Son of man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.
040	MAT	012	041	The men of Nineveh shall rise up in judgment against this generation, and condemn it: for they repented on the preaching of Jonah; and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.
040	MAT	012	042	The queen of the South shall rise up in judgment against the men of this generation, and condemn it: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.
040	MAT	012	043	When the unclean spirit is indeed gone out of a man, he traverses through places destitute of water, in search of rest, but cannot find it.
040	MAT	012	044	Then he saith, I will return to my mansion, whence I came; and on his arrival, he findeth it unoccupied, swept, and furnished.
040	MAT	012	045	Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. So shall it also be with this wicked generation.
040	MAT	012	046	And while he was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak to him.
040	MAT	012	047	And a person said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak to thee.
040	MAT	012	048	But he answered and said to him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?
040	MAT	012	049	And stretching out his hand towards his disciples, he said, Behold my mother and my brethren.
040	MAT	012	050	For whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.
040	MAT	013	001	THEN the same day Jesus going out from the house, sat down near the sea.
040	MAT	013	002	And vast multitudes were gathered together unto him, insomuch that he entered into a vessel to be seated; and all the multitude stood on the beach.
040	MAT	013	003	And he spake unto them many things in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went out to sow:
040	MAT	013	004	and as he was sowing, some seeds fell indeed by the road-side; and the birds came and ate them up:
040	MAT	013	005	and other seed fell on a rocky soil, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:
040	MAT	013	006	and when the sun arose, it was scorched up; and because it had no root, it withered away.
040	MAT	013	007	And other seeds fell among the thorns; and the thorns sprang up and choked them:
040	MAT	013	008	but others fell on good ground, and produced fruit, some an hundred, some sixty, and some thirty.
040	MAT	013	009	He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
040	MAT	013	010	And when his disciples came, they said to him, Why speakest thou to them in parables?
040	MAT	013	011	And he answered and said unto them, Because to you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.
040	MAT	013	012	For whosoever hath, more shall be given to him, and he shall have abundance: but whosoever hath not, even that he hath shall be taken from him.
040	MAT	013	013	Therefore I speak to them in parables: that seeing, they may not see; and hearing, they may not hear nor understand.
040	MAT	013	014	And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which saith, With the hearing ye shall hear, and not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and in no wise perceive:
040	MAT	013	015	for the heart of this people is waxed gross, and with their ears they have heard heavily, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with the eves, and hear with the ears, and understand with the heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.
040	MAT	013	016	But blessed are your eyes; for ye see: and your ears; for ye hear.
040	MAT	013	017	For verily I tell you, That many prophets and righteous men have greatly desired to see the things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear the things which ye hear, and have not heard them.
040	MAT	013	018	Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.
040	MAT	013	019	When any person heareth the word of the kingdom, and doth not understand it, the wicked one cometh, and snatcheth away what was sown on his heart: such is he who is the sown by the road-side.
040	MAT	013	020	But the sown on the rocky soil, is he who having heard the word, and instantly with joy receiving it,
040	MAT	013	021	hath not really root in himself, but is merely temporary: and when tribulation or persecution ariseth for the word’s sake, immediately he is stumbled.
040	MAT	013	022	But the sown among the thorns, is he who heareth the word, and the anxiety about this world and the deceitfulness of riches, choketh the word, and it becometh unfruitful.
040	MAT	013	023	But the sown upon the good ground, is he who heareth the word, and understandeth it; who truly beareth fruit, and produceth, one an hundred fold, and another sixty, and another thirty.
040	MAT	013	024	Another parable proposed he to them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like unto a man who sowed good seed in his field:
040	MAT	013	025	and while the men were asleep, his enemy came and sowed zizane among the wheat, and departed.
040	MAT	013	026	But when the blade was shot up, and produced fruit, then appeared also the zizane.
040	MAT	013	027	The servants of the proprietor came, and said to him, Master, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? whence then hath it the zizane?
040	MAT	013	028	He saith unto them, Some man, an enemy, hath done this. Then the servants said to him, Wilt thou that we go and weed them out?
040	MAT	013	029	he replied, No; lest perhaps in weeding out the zizane, we root up the wheat with them.
040	MAT	013	030	Let them both grow together till the harvest: and at the harvest-time I will say to the reapers, Gather out first the zizane, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.
040	MAT	013	031	Another parable he proposed to them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard, which a man took and sowed in his field:
040	MAT	013	032	which indeed is among the smallest of all seeds; but when it is grown, it is among the greatest of herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make their nests in the branches of it.
040	MAT	013	033	Another parable spake he to them: The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and covered up in three measures of flour, until the whole was leavened.
040	MAT	013	034	All these things spake Jesus in parables to the multitudes; and without a parable he spake not to them:
040	MAT	013	035	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables, I will bring forth things hid from the foundation of the world.
040	MAT	013	036	Then Jesus dismissing the multitudes, went into a house; and his disciples came unto him, saying, Explain to us the parable of the zizane of the field.
040	MAT	013	037	And he replying said to them, He that sowed the good seed, is the Son of man;
040	MAT	013	038	the field is the world: and the good seed are those who are the children of the kingdom; but the zizane are the children of the wicked one;
040	MAT	013	039	the enemy who sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.
040	MAT	013	040	As therefore the zizane are gathered, and burned in the fire; just so shall it be at the end of this world.
040	MAT	013	041	The Son of man shall send out his angels, and shall gather together out of his kingdom all things offensive, and those who practise iniquity;
040	MAT	013	042	and will cast them into a furnace of fire; there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
040	MAT	013	043	Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun, in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
040	MAT	013	044	Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hid in a field: which when a man findeth, he hideth, and for joy thereof, goeth away and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.
040	MAT	013	045	Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchantman in search of beautiful pearls:
040	MAT	013	046	who, having discovered one of vast price, went away and sold all that he possessed, and bought it.
040	MAT	013	047	Again, the kingdom of heaven is like to a net cast into the sea, and colleting fish of every kind:
040	MAT	013	048	which, when it was full, they drew to the beach, and sitting down, selected the good into baskets, but cast those of a bad kind away.
040	MAT	013	049	Just so shall it be at the end of this world: the angels shall go forth, and shall separate the wicked from amidst the just,
040	MAT	013	050	and shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
040	MAT	013	051	Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things?
040	MAT	013	052	They say unto him, Yes, Lord. Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe instructed unto the kingdom of heaven, is like unto a man, the master of a family, who bringeth out of his storehouse things new and old.
040	MAT	013	053	And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished there parables, he departed thence.
040	MAT	013	054	And coming into his own country, taught them in their synagogues, so that they were exceedingly struck, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these miracles?
040	MAT	013	055	Is not this the carpenter’s son? is not his mother called Mary? his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?
040	MAT	013	056	and his sisters, are they not all among us? whence then hath he all these things?
040	MAT	013	057	And they were offended at him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not disrespected, except in his own country, and in his own family.
040	MAT	013	058	And he did not there many miracles because of their unbelief.
040	MAT	014	001	AT that time Herod the tetrarch heard the report of Jesus,
040	MAT	014	002	and said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead, and therefore miracles are wrought by him.
040	MAT	014	003	For Herod having seized John, had bound him, and put him in prison, for the sake of Herodias, the wife of Philip his brother.
040	MAT	014	004	For John said unto him, It is unlawful for thee to have her.
040	MAT	014	005	And though he wished to kill him, he was afraid of the multitude, for they held him as a prophet.
040	MAT	014	006	But when Herod’s birth-day was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced in the circle, and pleased Herod:
040	MAT	014	007	so that with an oath he promised to give her whatever she should ask.
040	MAT	014	008	And she, being previously urged on by her mother, said, Give me here, in a spacious dish, the head of John the Baptist.
040	MAT	014	009	And the king was grieved: but for his oath’s sake, and on account of those who were with him, he commanded it to be given her.
040	MAT	014	010	And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.
040	MAT	014	011	And his head was brought on a large dish, and was given to the young lady: and she brought it to her mother.
040	MAT	014	012	And his disciples came and took the body, and buried it, and they came and told Jesus.
040	MAT	014	013	And when Jesus heard it, he withdrew from thence in a vessel into a desert place apart: and when the multitudes heard it, they followed him on foot from the cities.
040	MAT	014	014	And when Jesus was come forth, he saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion towards them, and healed their sick.
040	MAT	014	015	But when evening was come, his disciples came unto him, saying, The place is desert, and the day is far advanced; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves provisions.
040	MAT	014	016	But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart: give ye them to eat.
040	MAT	014	017	And they said unto him, We have nothing here except five loaves and two fishes.
040	MAT	014	018	Then he said, Bring them hither to me.
040	MAT	014	019	And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and taking the five loaves and the two fishes, looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
040	MAT	014	020	And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up the superabundance of the fragments, twelve baskets full.
040	MAT	014	021	And they who had eaten, were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
040	MAT	014	022	And immediately Jesus compelled his disciples to go on board the vessel, and pass before him to the other side, while he dismissed the people.
040	MAT	014	023	And when he had sent away the multitude, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when evening came, he was there alone.
040	MAT	014	024	But the vessel was already in the midst of the sea, tossed with the waves: for the wind was contrary.
040	MAT	014	025	Then at the fourth watch of the night came Jesus unto them, walking on the sea.
040	MAT	014	026	And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were greatly agitated, saying, It is his apparition. And they cried out with terror.
040	MAT	014	027	And immediately Jesus spake to them, saying, Be of good courage: it is I; be not terrified.
040	MAT	014	028	Then Peter answering, said, Lord, if it be thou, command me to come unto thee upon the waters.
040	MAT	014	029	And he said, Come. And descending from the vessel, Peter walked upon the waters to come to Jesus.
040	MAT	014	030	But seeing the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink in the deep, he cried out, saying, Lord save me.
040	MAT	014	031	Then immediately Jesus stretching out his hand, laid hold on him, and said to him, O thou of little faith, wherefore dost thou doubt?
040	MAT	014	032	And when they came aboard the vessel, the wind ceased.
040	MAT	014	033	And they who were in the vessel, came and worshipped him, saying, Truly thou art the Son of God.
040	MAT	014	034	And passing over, they came to the land of Gennesareth.
040	MAT	014	035	And when the men of that place knew him, they sent into all that neighbourhood, and brought to him all that had illnesses:
040	MAT	014	036	and they besought him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment: and as many as touched it were cured.
040	MAT	015	001	THEN came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees from Jerusalem, saying,
040	MAT	015	002	Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread?
040	MAT	015	003	And he answering said to them, And why do you transgress the command of God, by your tradition?
040	MAT	015	004	For God commanded, saying “Honour thy father and thy mother:” and, He that curseth father or mother, let him surely die.
040	MAT	015	005	But ye say, If any man declare to his father or mother, This is a devoted gift, which else might have been employed by me for thy advantage;
040	MAT	015	006	then he shall not with it honour his father and mother: so have ye vacated the command of God by your tradition.
040	MAT	015	007	Ye hypocrites, well hath Isaiah prophesied concerning you, saying,
040	MAT	015	008	This people draweth nigh to me with their mouths, and honoureth me with the lips, but their heart is far distant from me.
040	MAT	015	009	But in vain do they worship me, teaching doctrines the commandments of men.
040	MAT	015	010	And he called to him the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:
040	MAT	015	011	not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but what cometh out of the mouth, that defileth the man.
040	MAT	015	012	Then his disciples approaching, said to him, Knowest thou how offended the Pharisees were at hearing that speech?
040	MAT	015	013	Then he answered and said, Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted shall be rooted up.
040	MAT	015	014	Leave them to themselves: they are blind leaders of the blind. But if the blind lead the blind, they will both fall into the pit.
040	MAT	015	015	Then Peter answering said unto him, Explain to us this parable.
040	MAT	015	016	And Jesus said, Are ye also to this time destitute of intelligence?
040	MAT	015	017	Do ye not observe, that every thing which entereth into the mouth passeth into the belly, and is ejected into the vault?
040	MAT	015	018	But the things which go forth out of the mouth, come out of the heart, and they are the things which defile a man:
040	MAT	015	019	for out of the heart proceed wicked reasonings, murders, adulteries, whoredoms, thefts, false testimonies, blasphemies:
040	MAT	015	020	these are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashed hands doth not defile a man.
040	MAT	015	021	And going forth thence, Jesus retired into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.
040	MAT	015	022	And lo! a woman of Canaan coming out of these coasts, cried aloud, saying to him, Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David: my daughter is a grievous demoniac.
040	MAT	015	023	But he replied not a word to her. Then his disciples came and intreated him, saying, Send her away; for she is crying aloud after us.
040	MAT	015	024	But he said in reply, I am not sent, save only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
040	MAT	015	025	Then she came, and worshiped him, saying, Lord, help me!
040	MAT	015	026	But he answering said, It is not proper to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.
040	MAT	015	027	And she said, True, Lord: yet even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master’s table.
040	MAT	015	028	Then Jesus answering said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith! be it unto thee even as thou desirest. And her daughter was cured from that hour.
040	MAT	015	029	And departing thence, Jesus went to the sea-side of Galilee; and ascending a mountain, he sat down there.
040	MAT	015	030	And great multitudes came to him, bringing with them the lame, blind, dumb, cripples, and many others, and cast them down at the feet of Jesus; and he cured them all:
040	MAT	015	031	insomuch that the multitude marvelled when they saw the dumb speaking, the cripples sound, the lame walking, and the blind restored to sight: and they glorified the God of Israel.
040	MAT	015	032	Then Jesus calling his disciples, said, I have compassion on the multitude, for they have now continued with me three days, and have not any thing to eat: and send them away fasting I will not, lest they faint on the road.
040	MAT	015	033	And his disciples said unto him, Whence can we in the wilderness have loaves enough to satisfy the cravings of so great a multitude?
040	MAT	015	034	And Jesus said unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few small fishes.
040	MAT	015	035	And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.
040	MAT	015	036	And taking the seven loaves and the fishes, he gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
040	MAT	015	037	And they did all eat, and were filled: and took up a superabundance of fragments seven baskets full.
040	MAT	015	038	And they that had eaten were four thousand men, besides women and children.
040	MAT	015	039	And dismissing the multitudes he went on board a vessel, and came into the coasts of Magdala.
040	MAT	016	001	AND the Pharisees and the Sadducees came to him, and, to make trial of him, desired him to shew them a sign from heaven.
040	MAT	016	002	And he answering, said unto them, When evening comes, ye say, Fair weather, for the sky is red.
040	MAT	016	003	And in the morning, It will be tempestuous to-day, for the sky is gloomy and fiery red. Ye hypocrites, do ye know how to discern the appearance of the sky, and are ye unable to discern the signs of the times?
040	MAT	016	004	A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh a sign; and no sign shall be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonah. And he left them, and departed.
040	MAT	016	005	And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.
040	MAT	016	006	Then Jesus said to them, Beware and abstain from the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.
040	MAT	016	007	So they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have not taken bread.
040	MAT	016	008	But when Jesus knew it, he said unto them, Why are ye reasoning among yourselves, O ye of little faith, because ye have not taken bread?
040	MAT	016	009	Do you not consider, nor remember the five loaves among the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
040	MAT	016	010	Nor the seven loaves among the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
040	MAT	016	011	How is it that ye do not understand, that I spake not to you of bread, to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?
040	MAT	016	012	Then understood they, that he spake about abstaining not from the leaven in the bread, but from the doctrine of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.
040	MAT	016	013	Then Jesus coming into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, questioned his disciples, saying, Who do men say that I am? The Son of Man?
040	MAT	016	014	But they replied, Some, that thou art John the Baptist; but others, Elias; and others again, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.
040	MAT	016	015	He saith unto them, But who do ye say that I am?
040	MAT	016	016	Then Simon Peter answering said, Thou art the Messiah, the Son of the living God.
040	MAT	016	017	And Jesus replying, said to him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona; for flesh and blood hath not revealed this to thee, but my Father, who is in heaven.
040	MAT	016	018	And I tell thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock will I build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
040	MAT	016	019	And I will give thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
040	MAT	016	020	Then he commanded his disciples, that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Messiah.
040	MAT	016	021	From that time Jesus began to shew his disciples, that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders, and of the chief-priests, and of the scribes, and be put to death, and the third day rise again.
040	MAT	016	022	And Peter taking him aside, began to chide him, saying, Mercy on thee, Lord! this shall never be thy case.
040	MAT	016	023	Then turning from him, he said unto Peter, Get thee behind me Satan! thou art an offence to me: for thou dost not relish the things of God, but those of men.
040	MAT	016	024	Then said Jesus to his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
040	MAT	016	025	For whosoever is desirous to preserve his life, shall lose it; but whosoever would lose his life for my sake, shall find it.
040	MAT	016	026	For what would a man be advantaged, though he could gain the whole world, if he should suffer the loss of his soul? or what will a man give as the ransom for his soul?
040	MAT	016	027	For the Son of man shall hereafter come in the glory of his Father, with his angels, and then shall he recompense every man according to his practice.
040	MAT	016	028	Verily I say unto you, There are some of those standing here, who shall in no wise taste of death, until they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.
040	MAT	017	001	THEN six days after, Jesus taketh Peter, and James, and John his brother, and bringeth them into an exceeding high mountain apart.
040	MAT	017	002	And he was transformed before them; and his face shone as the sun, and his garments were white as the light.
040	MAT	017	003	And behold, there appeared to them, Moses and Elias talking with him.
040	MAT	017	004	Then Peter addressing him, said to Jesus, Lord, It is well that we are here; if it please thee, we will make here three tents; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.
040	MAT	017	005	And while he was yet speaking, behold, a luminous cloud overshadowed them; and lo! a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom is my delight; hear him!
040	MAT	017	006	And the disciples hearing it, fell on their face, and were exceedingly affrighted.
040	MAT	017	007	And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, be not affrighted.
040	MAT	017	008	Then lifting up their eyes, they saw no person, but Jesus only.
040	MAT	017	009	And when they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, Tell no man the vision, until the Son of man is risen from the dead.
040	MAT	017	010	And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then do the scribes affirm, that Elias must come first?
040	MAT	017	011	Then Jesus answering said unto them, Elias indeed cometh first, and will reform all things.
040	MAT	017	012	But I say unto you, That Elias is already come, and they knew him not, but have done by him whatsoever they chose: even so also must the Son of man suffer by them.
040	MAT	017	013	Then understood the disciples that he spake to them of John the Baptist.
040	MAT	017	014	And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a man, kneeling down to him, and saying,
040	MAT	017	015	Lord, have compassion on my son, for he is a lunatic, and suffers grievously; for oftentimes he falleth into the fire, and often into the water.
040	MAT	017	016	And I brought him to thy disciples, and they have not been able to cure him.
040	MAT	017	017	Then Jesus answering, said, O generation, faithless, and perverse! how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you? bring him hither to me.
040	MAT	017	018	And Jesus rebuked him, and the devil came out of him; and the child was cured from that hour.
040	MAT	017	019	Then the disciples of Jesus coming privately, said, Why could not we cast it out?
040	MAT	017	020	Then said Jesus unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard, ye shall say to this mountain, Remove from hence, thither, and it will remove; and nothing will be impossible for you.
040	MAT	017	021	But this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.
040	MAT	017	022	And as they were returning into Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of men:
040	MAT	017	023	and they shall kill him, and the third day he shall rise again. And they were grieved exceedingly.
040	MAT	017	024	And when they came to Capernaum, they who receive the tax of two drachmas came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute?
040	MAT	017	025	He saith, Yes. And when he came into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth receive customs and tax? from their own children, or from aliens?
040	MAT	017	026	Peter saith to him, From aliens. Jesus saith unto him, In that case then the children are free.
040	MAT	017	027	But that we give them no offence, go unto the sea, and cast in a hook, and take the first fish which cometh up; and on opening his mouth, thou wilt find a stater, that take and give them for me and thee.
040	MAT	018	001	AT that time came the disciples to Jesus, saying, Who is indeed the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?
040	MAT	018	002	And Jesus calling a little boy, set him in the midst of them,
040	MAT	018	003	and said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be changed and be as little children, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven.
040	MAT	018	004	Whosoever therefore shall humble himself, as this little child, he shall be greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
040	MAT	018	005	And whosoever shall receive one such little child in my name, receiveth me.
040	MAT	018	006	And whosoever shall cause one of these little ones, who believe in me, to stumble, it were better for him that a millstone was hung at his neck, and that he was sunk in the depth of the sea.
040	MAT	018	007	Wo to the world because of offences! for there is a necessity that offences come: nevertheless, wo to that man by whom the offence cometh!
040	MAT	018	008	If then thy hand, or thy foot, lead thee to offend, cut them off, and cast them from thee: for it were better for thee to enter into life, halting or maimed, than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the fire, which is eternal.
040	MAT	018	009	And if thine eye lead thee to offend, pluck it out and cast it from thee, for it were better for thee to enter into life with one eye only, than having two eyes to be cast into hell-fire.
040	MAT	018	010	See that ye despise not one of these little ones, for I say unto you, That their angels in heaven continually behold the face of my Father who is in heaven.
040	MAT	018	011	For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.
040	MAT	018	012	What think you? If a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them stray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine in the mountains, and go and seek that which had strayed?
040	MAT	018	013	And if he happen to find it, verily I say unto you, that he rejoiceth over it more than over the ninety and nine which never went astray.
040	MAT	018	014	Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven, that one of these little ones perish.
040	MAT	018	015	Now if thy brother sin against thee, go and reprove him between thyself and him alone; if he hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.
040	MAT	018	016	But if he will not hear thee, take with thee one or two more, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be confirmed.
040	MAT	018	017	But if he disregard them, inform the church: and if he disregard the church, let him be to thee as a heathen, or a publican.
040	MAT	018	018	Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever things ye shall bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever things ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
040	MAT	018	019	Again I say unto you, That if two of you are concurring upon earth, respecting any matter, which ye shall ask, it shall be done for them by my Father who is in heaven.
040	MAT	018	020	For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.
040	MAT	018	021	Then Peter coming to him, said, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?
040	MAT	018	022	Jesus saith to him, I tell thee not until seven times, but unto seventy times seven.
040	MAT	018	023	Therefore is the kingdom of heaven like unto a certain king who purposed to settle his account with his servants.
040	MAT	018	024	And when he began to make up the account, there was brought to him one debtor, ten thousand talents in arrear:
040	MAT	018	025	but not having wherewithal to pay, his lord ordered him to be sold, and his wife and his children, and all things whatsoever he possessed, and payment to be made.
040	MAT	018	026	Then that servant falling prostrate, paid him the most profound homage, saying, Lord, have forbearance with me, and I will pay thee all.
040	MAT	018	027	Then his lord, moved with compassion towards that servant, discharged him, and forgave him the debt.
040	MAT	018	028	But that servant going out, found one of his fellow-servants, who owed him a hundred denarii, and seizing, throttled him, saying, Pay me what thou owest.
040	MAT	018	029	Then his fellow-servant fell at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have forbearance with me, and I will pay thee all.
040	MAT	018	030	And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay what he owed.
040	MAT	018	031	Then his fellow-servants, when they saw what was done, were exceedingly sorry, and came to their lord, and gave him an explicit account of all things that had passed.
040	MAT	018	032	Then his lord, calling him before him, said to him, Thou vile slave! all that debt I forgave thee, because thou besoughtest me:
040	MAT	018	033	and oughtest thou not to have had compassion on thy fellow-servant, even as I had pity on thee?
040	MAT	018	034	And his lord, incensed, delivered him up to the torturers, till he should pay all that he owed him.
040	MAT	018	035	Even so also will my heavenly Father do to you, except ye forgive every one of you his brother, from your hearts, their trespasses.
040	MAT	019	001	AND it came to pass when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judea beyond Jordan.
040	MAT	019	002	And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.
040	MAT	019	003	And the Pharisees came to him, tempting him, and saying, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?
040	MAT	019	004	But he replying, said unto them, Have ye not read, that he who created them from the beginning, created them male and female?
040	MAT	019	005	And he said, for this reason shall a man forsake father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.
040	MAT	019	006	Wherefore they are no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God hath yoked together, let no man separate.
040	MAT	019	007	They say unto him, Why then did Moses command to give her a bill of divorce, and to put her away?
040	MAT	019	008	He saith unto them, It was on account of the hardness of your hearts that Moses gave you permission to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not thus.
040	MAT	019	009	And I tell you, that whosoever shall put away his wife, except for whoredom, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and he that marrieth the divorced woman, committeth adultery.
040	MAT	019	010	His disciples said unto him, If the case of a man with his wife be thus, it is not expedient to marry.
040	MAT	019	011	Then he said to them, All men are not capable of receiving this saying, but they to whom it is given.
040	MAT	019	012	For there are eunuchs, who were so from their mothers’ womb; and there are eunuchs, who have been made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs, who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven. He that is capable of receiving, let him receive it.
040	MAT	019	013	Then were brought to him little children, that he should lay his hands upon them, and pray for them: but the disciples rebuked them.
040	MAT	019	014	Then said Jesus, Permit little children, and hinder them not from coming to me; for of such is the kingdom of heaven.
040	MAT	019	015	And when he had laid his hands upon them, he departed thence.
040	MAT	019	016	And lo! a person coming to him, said, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, in order to attain eternal life?
040	MAT	019	017	Then he said to him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, even God: but if thou art desirous of entering into life, keep the commandments.
040	MAT	019	018	He saith unto him, Which? Then said Jesus, these, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,
040	MAT	019	019	Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
040	MAT	019	020	The young man saith to him, All these things have I observed from my youth: in what am I still deficient?
040	MAT	019	021	Jesus said to him, If thou art desirous to be perfect, go, sell all thy substance, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.
040	MAT	019	022	Now when the young man heard this speech, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.
040	MAT	019	023	Then Jesus said to his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That very difficultly shall a rich man enter into the kingdom of heaven.
040	MAT	019	024	And again I repeat it to you, It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
040	MAT	019	025	But when his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?
040	MAT	019	026	And Jesus looking upon them, said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.
040	MAT	019	027	Then Peter addressing him, said unto him, Lo! we have left all and followed thee; what, I pray thee, shall we receive?
040	MAT	019	028	Then said Jesus unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye who have followed me in the regeneration, when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
040	MAT	019	029	And every one who hath left family, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name sake, shall receive an hundred fold, and shall inherit life eternal.
040	MAT	019	030	But many, now first, will be the last; and last, who will be the first.
040	MAT	020	001	FOR the kingdom of heaven is like a man, the master of a family, who went out at break of day, to hire labourers into his vineyard.
040	MAT	020	002	And when he had agreed with the labourers at a denarius a day, he sent them into the vineyard.
040	MAT	020	003	And going out about the third hour, he saw others standing in the market place unemployed.
040	MAT	020	004	And he said to them, Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatever is equitable, I will give it you. So they went.
040	MAT	020	005	Again going out, about the sixth and ninth hour, he did after the same manner.
040	MAT	020	006	But about the eleventh hour, going out, he found others standing unemployed, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?
040	MAT	020	007	They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith to them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatever is equitable, ye shall receive.
040	MAT	020	008	Now when the evening came, the master of the vineyard said to his overseer, Call the labourers, and give them their wages, beginning from the last to the first.
040	MAT	020	009	And when they came, who began about the eleventh hour, they received each a denarius.
040	MAT	020	010	But when the first came, they expected that they should receive more; and they also received every man a denarius.
040	MAT	020	011	But when they received it, they murmured against the master of the family:
040	MAT	020	012	saying, These last have wrought only a single hour, and thou hast put them on an equality with us, who have borne the burden and heat of the day.
040	MAT	020	013	But he answering, said to one of them, Friend, I do thee no injustice; did I not agree with thee for a denarius?
040	MAT	020	014	Take then thine own, and begone: I chuse to give to this last even as to thee.
040	MAT	020	015	Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with my own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?
040	MAT	020	016	Thus shall the last be first, and the first last; for many are called, but the elect are few.
040	MAT	020	017	And Jesus going up to Jerusalem, took his twelve disciples aside on the road, and said to them;
040	MAT	020	018	Lo! we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man will be betrayed to the chief priests and scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,
040	MAT	020	019	and shall deliver him to the Gentiles, to insult, and to scourge, and to crucify: and the third day he shall rise again.
040	MAT	020	020	Then came to him the mother of Zebedee’s children, with her sons, paying him obeisance, and petitioning a favour of him.
040	MAT	020	021	Then he said to her, What is thy wish? She saith unto him, Tell me that these my two sons shall sit, the one at thy right hand, and the other at thy left, in thy kingdom.
040	MAT	020	022	Then Jesus answering said, Ye know not what ye ask. Can ye drink of the cup that I am going to drink, and be baptised with the baptism with which I am baptised? They say unto him, We are able.
040	MAT	020	023	And he saith unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of my cup, and with the baptism with which I am baptised, shall ye be baptised; but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, it is not in my power to bestow, but on those, for whom it was prepared by my Father.
040	MAT	020	024	And the twelve, on hearing this, were filled with indignation against the two brethren.
040	MAT	020	025	But Jesus, calling them to him, said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority among them.
040	MAT	020	026	But thus shall it not be with you. But whosoever will be a great man among you, let him be your servant;
040	MAT	020	027	and whosoever will be first, let him be your slave.
040	MAT	020	028	Even as the Son of man came not to be waited upon, but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.
040	MAT	020	029	And as they were going out of Jericho, a great multitude followed him.
040	MAT	020	030	And, behold, two blind men sat by the road side, who hearing that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, son of David!
040	MAT	020	031	And the multitude checked them, that they should be silent; but they cried out the more, Have mercy on us, Lord, son of David.
040	MAT	020	032	And Jesus standing called them, and said, What desire ye, that I should do for you?
040	MAT	020	033	They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
040	MAT	020	034	Then Jesus, moved with compassion, touched their eyes; and immediately their eyes recovered sight, and they followed him.
040	MAT	021	001	AND when they drew nigh to Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage to the mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,
040	MAT	021	002	saying to them, Go into the village, which is opposite you, and immediately you will find an ass tied, and a foal with her; loose and bring them to me.
040	MAT	021	003	And if any man say aught to you, ye shall tell them, That the Lord hath need of them, and immediately he will send them.
040	MAT	021	004	Now this was entirely done, that what was spoken by the prophet might be fulfilled, saying,
040	MAT	021	005	“Tell the daughter of Sion, Lo! thy King cometh to thee, meek, and sitting on an ass, even on a foal the ass’s colt.”
040	MAT	021	006	Then the disciples going, and doing as Jesus had commanded them,
040	MAT	021	007	brought the ass and her foal, and they spread over them their garments, and seated him upon them.
040	MAT	021	008	And a vast multitude spread their garments on the road, and others cut down branches from the trees, and strewed them on the road:
040	MAT	021	009	and the multitudes who went before, and who followed after, cried, saying, Hosanna, to the son of David; blessed is he who cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.
040	MAT	021	010	And when he was entered into Jerusalem, the whole city was in commotion, saying, Who is this?
040	MAT	021	011	Then the multitudes said, This is Jesus, the prophet, who is from Nazareth of Galilee.
040	MAT	021	012	And Jesus entered into the temple of God, and cast out all those who sold and bought in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of those who sold doves
040	MAT	021	013	and said unto them, It is written, “My house shall be called a house of prayer,” but ye have made it a den of robbers.
040	MAT	021	014	Then the blind and the lame came unto him, into the temple, and he cured them.
040	MAT	021	015	But when the chief priests and scribes saw the marvellous acts which he did, and the children crying out in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were filled with indignation;
040	MAT	021	016	and said to him, Hearest thou what these say? Jesus replied to them, Yes; but have ye never read, “That out of the mouths of infants and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?”
040	MAT	021	017	And turning his back upon them, he went out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there.
040	MAT	021	018	Now in the morning, when returning into the city, he was hungry:
040	MAT	021	019	and seeing a fig-tree at the road side, he went up to it, and found nothing on it but leaves only: and saith unto it, Let no fruit spring from thee henceforth for ever: and immediately the fig-tree withered entirely away.
040	MAT	021	020	And when his disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How suddenly is the fig-tree withered away!
040	MAT	021	021	But Jesus addressing them, said, Verily I tell you, if ye have faith, and entertain no doubt, not only shall ye do what is done to the fig-tree, but if ye should even say to this mountain, Be lifted up, and be cast into the sea, it be done.
040	MAT	021	022	And all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.
040	MAT	021	023	And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him, as he was teaching, demanding, By what authority doest thou these things? And who gave thee this authority?
040	MAT	021	024	Then Jesus answering, said to them, I also will ask you one question, which if ye answer me, then will I tell you by what authority I do these things.
040	MAT	021	025	The baptism of John whence was it? from heaven, or from men? Hereupon they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we reply, From heaven, he will say to us, Why then did ye not believe him?
040	MAT	021	026	But if we say, From men, we are afraid of the populace, for they all hold John as a prophet.
040	MAT	021	027	So they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. Then said he also to them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.
040	MAT	021	028	But what think ye? A man had two sons; and coming to the first he said, Son, go work to-day in my vineyard.
040	MAT	021	029	But he answering said, I will not: yet repenting afterwards, he went.
040	MAT	021	030	And coming to the other, he spake after the same manner, and he replying, said, I go, sir; yet went not.
040	MAT	021	031	Which of the two did the will of his father? They say to him, The first. Jesus saith to them, Verily I say unto you, That tax-gatherers and harlots shall go before you into the kingdom of God.
040	MAT	021	032	For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the tax-gatherers and harlots believed on him. But ye, when ye saw it, repented not afterwards, that ye should believe on him.
040	MAT	021	033	Hear another parable: There was a certain man, the master of a family, who planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about it, and digged in it a wine-press, and built a tower, and hired it out to husbandmen, and went into a distant country.
040	MAT	021	034	But when the season for fruits drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen to receive his fruits.
040	MAT	021	035	And the husbandmen took his servants, one they beat, and another they killed, and a third they stoned.
040	MAT	021	036	Again he sent other servants more than the first, and they treated them in the same manner.
040	MAT	021	037	Then at last he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.
040	MAT	021	038	But the husbandmen, when they saw the son, said among themselves, This is the heir, come let us kill him, and let us seize on the inheritance.
040	MAT	021	039	And they took him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him.
040	MAT	021	040	When therefore the master of the vineyard cometh, what will he do with these husbandmen?
040	MAT	021	041	They say unto him, He will dreadfully destroy those wicked wretches, and will let out his vineyard to other husbandmen, who will render him the fruits in their seasons.
040	MAT	021	042	Jesus saith unto them, Have ye not read in the Scriptures, “The stone, which the builders rejected; the same is become the head of the corner; this is done by the Lord, and it is wonderful in our eyes.”
040	MAT	021	043	Therefore I tell you, That the kingdom of God shall be taken away from you, and given to a nation, producing the fruits thereof.
040	MAT	021	044	And whosoever shall fall on this stone, shall be broken in pieces, but on whomsoever it shall fall, it shall grind him to powder.
040	MAT	021	045	And when the chief priests and Pharisees heard his parables, they knew that he was speaking concerning them.
040	MAT	021	046	And they sought to apprehend him; but were afraid of the people, for they held him as a prophet.
040	MAT	022	001	AND Jesus continuing his discourse, spake again to them in parables, saying,
040	MAT	022	002	The kingdom of heaven is like to a certain king, who made a marriage-feast for his son:
040	MAT	022	003	and sent his servants to call those who were invited to the entertainment: and they would not come.
040	MAT	022	004	Again he sent other servants, saying, Tell those who have been invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and the fatlings are killed, and all things are ready; come unto the marriage-feast.
040	MAT	022	005	But they gave themselves no concern about it, and went their several ways, one to his own farm, and another to his traffick:
040	MAT	022	006	And the rest seizing his servants, insulted and slew them.
040	MAT	022	007	Then the king, when he heard it, was incensed: and sending out his armies, destroyed these murderers, and burnt down their city.
040	MAT	022	008	Then he said to his servants, The wedding entertainment indeed is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy:
040	MAT	022	009	go therefore into the thoroughfares of the roads, and as many as ye find, invite to the banquet.
040	MAT	022	010	So these servants going out into the roads, collected all, as many as they found, both bad and good; and the wedding feast was fully furnished with guests.
040	MAT	022	011	Then the king coming in to look around on the guests, saw there a man who had not put on the wedding garment:
040	MAT	022	012	and he saith to him, Friend, how came thou in here, not having the garment provided for the marriage feast? And he was speechless.
040	MAT	022	013	Then said the king to the servants, Bind his feet and hands, and take him away, and cast him into the darkness, which is without; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
040	MAT	022	014	For many are called, but few elect.
040	MAT	022	015	Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel together how they might lay a snare to entrap him in his discourse.
040	MAT	022	016	And they sent to him their disciples, with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God with veracity; and carest for no man, for thou regardest not the person of men:
040	MAT	022	017	tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to pay tribute to Caesar, or not?
040	MAT	022	018	But Jesus knew their wicked design, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?
040	MAT	022	019	Shew me the money for the tribute; and they brought him a denarius.
040	MAT	022	020	And he saith unto them, Whose figure is this and inscription?
040	MAT	022	021	They say unto him, Caesar’s. Then saith he to them, Render therefore to Caesar, the things which are Caesar’s; and to God, the things which are God’s.
040	MAT	022	022	And when they heard him, they marvelled, and leaving him, went away.
040	MAT	022	023	On the same day the Sadducees came to him, who say, that there is no resurrection, and they put a question to him,
040	MAT	022	024	saying, Master, Moses said, “If a man die having no children, his brother in right of affinity shall marry his wife, and raise up seed for his brother.”
040	MAT	022	025	Now there were with us seven brothers; and the first marrying, died, and had no offspring, and left his wife to his brother;
040	MAT	022	026	likewise the second also; then the third; so on to the seven.
040	MAT	022	027	Last of all the woman died also.
040	MAT	022	028	In the resurrection therefore, whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.
040	MAT	022	029	Jesus then answering, said unto them, Ye are in an error, from not knowing the Scriptures, and the power of God.
040	MAT	022	030	For at the resurrection, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.
040	MAT	022	031	But with respect to the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read what was spoken to you of God, saying,
040	MAT	022	032	“I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?” God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
040	MAT	022	033	And when the multitude heard it, they were amazingly struck with his doctrine.
040	MAT	022	034	But the Pharisees hearing that he had stopped the Sadducees’ mouths, they assembled together:
040	MAT	022	035	and one of them, a teacher of the law, put a question to him, to make trial of him, and said,
040	MAT	022	036	Master, which is the great commandment in the law?
040	MAT	022	037	Then Jesus said to him, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.”
040	MAT	022	038	This is the first and great commandment.
040	MAT	022	039	And the second is like to it, “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.”
040	MAT	022	040	On these two commandments, the whole law and the prophets depend.
040	MAT	022	041	The Pharisees being then assembled, Jesus put a question to them,
040	MAT	022	042	saying, What think ye of the Messiah, whose son is he? They say unto him, David’s.
040	MAT	022	043	He saith unto them, How then doth David by the Spirit call him Lord? saying,
040	MAT	022	044	“The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit at my right hand, till I put thine enemies as a footstool for thy feet.”
040	MAT	022	045	If then David calleth him Lord, how is he his son?
040	MAT	022	046	And no man could answer him a word, neither durst any man, from that day, interrogate him any more.
040	MAT	023	001	THEN Jesus spake to the multitudes and to his disciples,
040	MAT	023	002	saying, The scribes and Pharisees are seated on the chair of Moses;
040	MAT	023	003	all things therefore which they prescribe for you to observe, observe and practise; but do not according to their works, for they say, yet do not practise.
040	MAT	023	004	For they bind burdens grievous, and difficultly borne, and lay them on men’s shoulders; but they will not move them with a finger of their own.
040	MAT	023	005	And all their works they do to be seen of men: they make their phylacteries broad, and deepen the fringes of their garments,
040	MAT	023	006	and love the principal couch at suppers, and the chief seats in the synagogues,
040	MAT	023	007	and salutations in the places of public concourse, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.
040	MAT	023	008	But be not ye called Rabbi, for one is your leader, the Messiah; and ye all are brethren.
040	MAT	023	009	And call no man your father upon earth; for one is your father, who is in heaven.
040	MAT	023	010	And be not called leaders; for one is your leader, the Messiah.
040	MAT	023	011	But he who is greatest among you shall be your servant.
040	MAT	023	012	For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and whosoever abaseth himself shall be exalted.
040	MAT	023	013	Wo unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye shut up the kingdom of heaven from men; for ye yourselves enter not in, and those who were coming in, ye suffer not to enter.
040	MAT	023	014	Wo unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: wherefore ye shall receive greater condemnation.
040	MAT	023	015	Wo unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he is gained, ye make him doubly more the child of hell than yourselves.
040	MAT	023	016	Wo unto you ye blind guides! who say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, it is binding.
040	MAT	023	017	Ye fools and blind! for which is the greater, the gold, or the temple which consecrates the gold?
040	MAT	023	018	And again, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gift that is upon it, it is binding.
040	MAT	023	019	Ye fools and blind! which is the greater, the gift, or the altar which consecrates the gift?
040	MAT	023	020	Whosoever therefore sweareth by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things that are upon it.
040	MAT	023	021	And whosoever sweareth by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him also who dwelleth in it.
040	MAT	023	022	So he that sweareth by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him who is seated upon it.
040	MAT	023	023	Wo unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithes of mint, and anise, and cummin, and have neglected the weightier precepts of the law, judgment, and mercy, and fidelity: these thing ought ye to have done, and not to leave the others undone.
040	MAT	023	024	Ye blind guides! who strain out a gnat, but gulp down a camel.
040	MAT	023	025	Wo unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye cleanse the outside of the cup, and of the dish, but within they are full of rapacity and intemperance.
040	MAT	023	026	Thou blind Pharisee! cleanse first the inside of the cup and dish, that their outside may become clean also.
040	MAT	023	027	Wo unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye resemble tombs whitewashed, which outwardly indeed appear specious, but within are full of dead men’s bones, and all manner of impurity.
040	MAT	023	028	And just so, ye without indeed appear to men righteous, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
040	MAT	023	029	Wo unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye build the tombs of the prophets, and adorn the sepulchres of the just,
040	MAT	023	030	and say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.
040	MAT	023	031	Wherefore ye bear a testimony to yourselves, that ye are the children of those who killed the prophets.
040	MAT	023	032	Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.
040	MAT	023	033	Ye serpents, ye broods of vipers! how can ye escape from the damnation of hell?
040	MAT	023	034	Therefore, behold, I am sending to you prophets, and wise men, and scribes; and some of them ye shall kill, and crucify; and some of them ye shall scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city:
040	MAT	023	035	that upon you may come all the righteous blood which hath been poured out upon the earth, from the blood of the righteous Abel, to the blood of Zachariah, son of Barachiah, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.
040	MAT	023	036	Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come on this generation.
040	MAT	023	037	O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killest the prophets, and stonest those who were sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children to me, as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not?
040	MAT	023	038	Behold, your habitation is left unto you desolate.
040	MAT	023	039	For I tell you, Ye shall henceforth no more see me, until ye say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
040	MAT	024	001	AND Jesus departing was going his way from the temple: and his disciples came to him, to point out to his observation the buildings of the temple.
040	MAT	024	002	But Jesus said unto them, Do you not see all these things? I tell you of a certainty, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, which shall not be utterly thrown down.
040	MAT	024	003	Then as he was sitting upon the mount of Olives, his disciples came to him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall there things be? and what is the sign of thy coming, and of the consummation of the age?
040	MAT	024	004	And Jesus answering said unto them, Beware that no man deceive you.
040	MAT	024	005	For many will come in my name, saying, I am the Messiah; and shall deceive multitudes.
040	MAT	024	006	And ye shall hear of wars, and rumours of wars: see that ye be not terrified: for these things must first be, but the end is not yet.
040	MAT	024	007	For nation shall be roused up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in diverse places.
040	MAT	024	008	Now all these things are the beginning of the travailing pangs.
040	MAT	024	009	Then shall they deliver you up to affliction, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake.
040	MAT	024	010	And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and hate one another.
040	MAT	024	011	And many false prophets shall arise, and shall deceive many.
040	MAT	024	012	And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many will grow cool.
040	MAT	024	013	But he that endureth to the end, that man will be saved.
040	MAT	024	014	And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached through the whole world for a testimony to all the nations: and then shall come the final close.
040	MAT	024	015	When therefore ye see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by the prophet Daniel, erected in the holy place, (let him that readeth, mark this, )
040	MAT	024	016	then let such as are in Judea flee into the mountains.
040	MAT	024	017	Let not him who is upon the roof go down to take any thing out of his house.
040	MAT	024	018	And he that is in the field, let him not turn back to take his garment.
040	MAT	024	019	But wo to those who are with child, and have an infant at their breasts in those days!
040	MAT	024	020	And pray that your flight be not in winter, nor on the sabbath.
040	MAT	024	021	For then the tribulation will be great, such as never was from the beginning of the world, and never more shall be.
040	MAT	024	022	And except those days were shortened, there would be no flesh saved: but for the elect’s sake these days shall be shortened.
040	MAT	024	023	Then if any man say unto you, Lo! here is the Messiah, or there; believe it not:
040	MAT	024	024	for false Messiahs and false prophets shall arise, and give out great signs and wonders; so as to deceive, if it were possible, even the elect.
040	MAT	024	025	Behold, I have forewarned you.
040	MAT	024	026	Therefore if they say to you, He is in the wilderness; go not out: lo! he is in the secret closets; believe it not.
040	MAT	024	027	For as the lightning cometh out from the east, and flashes to the west; so shall be the coming of the Son of man.
040	MAT	024	028	For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.
040	MAT	024	029	Then, immediately after the tribulation of those days, shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.
040	MAT	024	030	And then shall the sign of the Son of man appear in the heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth lament bitterly, and they shall see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
040	MAT	024	031	And he shall send forth his angels with a trumpet, and a great shout, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the extremities of the heavens to the extremities of the same.
040	MAT	024	032	Learn then a parable from the fig-tree; when its branch is now tender, and the leaves shoot forth, ye know that summer is nigh:
040	MAT	024	033	just so ye, when ye behold these things, know that it is near, even at the gates.
040	MAT	024	034	Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away until all these things shall be done.
040	MAT	024	035	Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall in no wise pass away.
040	MAT	024	036	But of that day and hour no man knoweth, not even the angels of heaven, but my Father alone.
040	MAT	024	037	But as the days of Noah were, so also shall the coming of the Son of man be.
040	MAT	024	038	For as they were in the days preceding the deluge, eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark,
040	MAT	024	039	and they knew it not till the deluge came, and swept them all away; such also shall the coming of the Son of man be.
040	MAT	024	040	Then two shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other dismissed.
040	MAT	024	041	Two women grinding at the mill; the one taken, the other dismissed.
040	MAT	024	042	Watch therefore: for ye know not at what hour your Master cometh.
040	MAT	024	043	And this observe, that if the master of the family had known in which watch of the night the thief would have come, he would have watched, and not have suffered him to break into his house.
040	MAT	024	044	Therefore be ye also prepared: for in an hour that ye think not, the Son of man cometh.
040	MAT	024	045	Who then is the faithful and provident servant, whom his Lord hath appointed over his household, to give them meat in the proper time?
040	MAT	024	046	Blessed is that servant whom his Lord when he cometh shall find thus occupied.
040	MAT	024	047	Verily I say unto you, that he will place him over all his substance.
040	MAT	024	048	But if that wicked servant say in his heart, My master will be a long while ere he comes;
040	MAT	024	049	and shall begin to beat his fellow-servants, and to eat and drink with the drunken;
040	MAT	024	050	the master of that servant will come in a day that he doth not expect him, and at an hour which he knoweth not.
040	MAT	024	051	And will cut him asunder, and give him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
040	MAT	025	001	THEN shall the kingdom of heaven be like to ten virgins, who taking their lamps, went forth to meet the bridegroom.
040	MAT	025	002	But five of them were provident, and five foolish.
040	MAT	025	003	Those who were taking their lamps, took no oil with them:
040	MAT	025	004	but the provident took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
040	MAT	025	005	But as the bridegroom stayed long, they all slumbered and slept.
040	MAT	025	006	Then at midnight the cry came, Behold, the bridegroom is coming; go forth to meet him.
040	MAT	025	007	Then all these virgins arose, and set about trimming their lamps.
040	MAT	025	008	And the foolish said to the provident, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.
040	MAT	025	009	But the provident replied, saying, No; lest there be not a sufficiency for us and you: but go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.
040	MAT	025	010	But while they were gone away to buy, the bridegroom came; and they who were prepared went in with him to the marriage-feast: and the door was shut.
040	MAT	025	011	Then came afterwards the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us.
040	MAT	025	012	But he answering said, Verily, I know you not.
040	MAT	025	013	Watch therefore, for ye know not the day nor the hour in which the Son of man cometh.
040	MAT	025	014	For the case is like that of a man, who travelling abroad, called his own servants, and delivered to them his goods.
040	MAT	025	015	And to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, to each according to his several capacity; and immediately went abroad.
040	MAT	025	016	He then who had received the five talents, went and traded with them, and acquired five other talents.
040	MAT	025	017	In the same manner also he that had the two, gained also himself two others.
040	MAT	025	018	But he that had received the one talent, went and digged a hole in the ground, and hid the silver of his master.
040	MAT	025	019	Then after a long absence the master of these servants cometh, and maketh a reckoning with them.
040	MAT	025	020	And he who had received the five talents, coming to him, brought five other talents, saying, Sir, thou deliveredst to me five talents: I have gained to them five other talents.
040	MAT	025	021	His master said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will place thee over many: enter into the joy of thy master.
040	MAT	025	022	Then came also he that had received the two talents: and said, Sir, thou deliveredst to me two talents: lo! I have gained to them two other talents.
040	MAT	025	023	His master said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will place thee over many: enter thou into thy master’s joy.
040	MAT	025	024	Then came also he that had received the one talent, and said, Sir, knowing thee, that thou art a severe man, reaping where thou hast not sowed, and gathering from whence thou hast not scattered:
040	MAT	025	025	and being afraid, I went and hid thy talent in the ground: see here, thou hast thine own.
040	MAT	025	026	Then his master answering said to him, Thou wicked and idle slave, thou knewest that I reap whence I had not sown, and gather where I had not scattered:
040	MAT	025	027	thou oughtest then to have placed my money with the bankers, so when I came I should have received my own with interest.
040	MAT	025	028	Take therefore from him the talent, and give it to him that hath the ten talents.
040	MAT	025	029	For to every one that hath shall be given, and he shall abound: but from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him.
040	MAT	025	030	And cast the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
040	MAT	025	031	But when the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his glory:
040	MAT	025	032	and before him shall all the nations be gathered together; and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats:
040	MAT	025	033	and he shall place the sheep at his right hand, but the goats at the left.
040	MAT	025	034	Then shall the King say to those on his right-hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world;
040	MAT	025	035	for I was hungry, and ye gave me to eat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me to drink: I was a stranger, and ye received me hospitably:
040	MAT	025	036	naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye took care of me: I was in prison, and ye came to me.
040	MAT	025	037	Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?
040	MAT	025	038	When indeed saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?
040	MAT	025	039	When indeed saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?
040	MAT	025	040	And the king answering shall say to them, Verily I tell you, for as much as ye have done it to one of these my brethren, the very least of them, ye have done it unto me.
040	MAT	025	041	Then shall he say also to those on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:
040	MAT	025	042	for I was hungry, and ye gave me nothing to eat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me nothing to drink:
040	MAT	025	043	I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye did not clothe me: sick, and in prison, and ye took no care of me.
040	MAT	025	044	Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?
040	MAT	025	045	Then shall he reply to them, saying, For as much as ye have not done it to one of the least of these, neither have ye done it to me.
040	MAT	025	046	And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.
040	MAT	026	001	AND it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples,
040	MAT	026	002	Ye know that after two days is the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.
040	MAT	026	003	Then were the chief priests and scribes, and the elders of the people gathered together in the palace of the high-priest, called Caiaphas.
040	MAT	026	004	And they consulted together, how they might seize Jesus by guile, and put him to death.
040	MAT	026	005	But they said, Not on the feast-day, lest there be a tumult among the people.
040	MAT	026	006	Now when Jesus was at Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
040	MAT	026	007	there came to him a woman having an alabaster-box of very precious aromatic ointment, and poured it upon his head as he sat at table.
040	MAT	026	008	But when the disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, For what end is this waste?
040	MAT	026	009	For this ointment might have been sold for a considerable sum, and given to the poor.
040	MAT	026	010	Then Jesus knowing it, said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath performed a good act upon me:
040	MAT	026	011	for the poor ye have always with you, but me ye have not always:
040	MAT	026	012	for in pouring this odoriferous ointment on my body, she hath done it for my burial.
040	MAT	026	013	Verily I say unto you, Wherever this Gospel is preached through the whole world, what she hath done shall be also spoken of for a memorial of her.
040	MAT	026	014	Then went one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, to the chief priests,
040	MAT	026	015	and said, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? Then they placed before him thirty pieces of silver.
040	MAT	026	016	And from that time he sought an opportunity to deliver him up to them.
040	MAT	026	017	Then on the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?
040	MAT	026	018	And he said, Go into the city, unto such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand: I will keep the passover with my disciples at thy house.
040	MAT	026	019	And his disciples did as Jesus commanded them; and they made ready the passover.
040	MAT	026	020	And when the evening was come, he sat down at table with the twelve.
040	MAT	026	021	And as they were eating, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.
040	MAT	026	022	And exceedingly grieved, they began to say to him every one of them, Lord, am I the person?
040	MAT	026	023	But he answering said, He that dippeth his hand with me into the dish, that man shall betray me.
040	MAT	026	024	The Son of man indeed is departing, as it is written of him: but wo to that man, by whom the Son of man is betrayed! well had it been for that man if he had never had a being.
040	MAT	026	025	Then Judas, who betrayed him, addressing him said, Master, is it I? He saith to him, Thou hast named the person.
040	MAT	026	026	Then as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessing, brake, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.
040	MAT	026	027	And taking the cup, and giving thanks, he gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of this:
040	MAT	026	028	for this is my blood, that blood of the new testament, which is shed for many, for the remission of sins.
040	MAT	026	029	And I tell you, That I will no more henceforth drink of this produce of the vine, until that day when I drink it with you, new, in the kingdom of my Father.
040	MAT	026	030	And when they had sung an hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives.
040	MAT	026	031	Then saith Jesus unto them, Ye all will be offended at me this night: for it is written, “I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.”
040	MAT	026	032	But after I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.
040	MAT	026	033	Then Peter, taking up the word, said to him, Though all should be offended at thee, yet will I never be offended.
040	MAT	026	034	Jesus saith to him, I tell thee of a certainty, that this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.
040	MAT	026	035	Peter said to him, Though I should die with thee, never will I deny thee. In like manner also said all the disciples.
040	MAT	026	036	Then cometh Jesus with them to a place called Gethsemane, and saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.
040	MAT	026	037	And taking Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be deeply sorrowful, and to be overwhelmed with dejection.
040	MAT	026	038	Then saith he to them. My soul is exceeding sorrowful even to death: abide here, and watch with me.
040	MAT	026	039	And going a little farther, he fell on his face, praying, and saying, My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.
040	MAT	026	040	And he cometh to the disciples, and findeth them sleeping, and he saith to Peter, Is it so, that ye have not strength to watch with me one hour?
040	MAT	026	041	Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh weak.
040	MAT	026	042	Again the second time he went away, and prayed, saying, O my Father, If it be not possible, that this cup pass from me, but that I should drink it, thy will be done.
040	MAT	026	043	And coming, he found them asleep again, for their eyes were weighed down.
040	MAT	026	044	And leaving them, he went away again, and prayed the third time, repeating the same sentence.
040	MAT	026	045	Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Do ye still sleep on, and repose yourselves? lo! the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
040	MAT	026	046	Arise, let us go: lo! he that betrayeth me approaches.
040	MAT	026	047	And while he was yet speaking, behold, Judas one of the twelve came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.
040	MAT	026	048	Now he that betrayed him had given them a signal, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he: seize him.
040	MAT	026	049	And immediately approaching to Jesus, he said, Hail, master; and kissed him.
040	MAT	026	050	Then spake Jesus to him, Friend, for what purpose art thou here? Then approaching they laid hands on Jesus, and seized him.
040	MAT	026	051	And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretching out his hand, drew his sword, and striking at a servant of the high-priest, cut off his ear.
040	MAT	026	052	Then saith Jesus unto him, Return thy sword into its sheath: for all who take the sword, shall perish by the sword.
040	MAT	026	053	Thinkest thou, that I cannot now entreat my Father, and he will give me more than twelve legions of angels?
040	MAT	026	054	But how then would the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?
040	MAT	026	055	In that hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a robber, with swords and staves to apprehend me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid not hold upon me.
040	MAT	026	056	But all this is come to pass, that the scriptures of the prophets should be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.
040	MAT	026	057	Then they who had apprehended Jesus, brought him to Caiaphas the high-priest, where the scribes and elders were assembled.
040	MAT	026	058	But Peter followed him at a great distance unto the palace of the high-priest, and entering in, sat down with the servants, to see the issue.
040	MAT	026	059	Now the chief priests and elders and the whole sanhedrim, sought false witness against Jesus, that they might put him to death;
040	MAT	026	060	and found none: and though many false witnesses came, they found it not sufficient. But at the last two false witnesses stepping forth,
040	MAT	026	061	said, This fellow said, I am able to pull down the temple of God, and to build it up in three days.
040	MAT	026	062	And the high-priest rising up, said to him, Answerest thou nothing? what do these men witness against thee?
040	MAT	026	063	But Jesus was silent. And the high-priest addressing him, said, I adjure thee, by the living God, that thou tell us, if thou art the Messiah, the Son of God.
040	MAT	026	064	Jesus saith to him, Thou hast spoken the fact. Moreover I tell you, hereafter ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.
040	MAT	026	065	Then the high-priest rent his garments, saying, he hath blasphemed: what farther need have we of witnesses? lo! now ye have heard his blasphemy:
040	MAT	026	066	what think ye? They answered and said, He is deserving of death.
040	MAT	026	067	Then they spit in his face, and buffeted him about; and some slapt his face with their hands,
040	MAT	026	068	saying, Prophesy to us, you Messiah, who it is that struck thee!
040	MAT	026	069	Now Peter sat without in the hall: and there came to him a single maid-servant, saying, Thou also wert with Jesus of Galilee.
040	MAT	026	070	But he denied it before them all, asserting, I know not what thou art saying.
040	MAT	026	071	Then as he was going out at the gate, another maid-servant saw him, and saith to those who were there, This fellow also was with Jesus of Nazareth.
040	MAT	026	072	Then again he denied with an oath, I know not the man.
040	MAT	026	073	But after a little while they who stood by, came up and said to Peter, Assuredly thou also art one of them: for even thy speech maketh thee manifest.
040	MAT	026	074	Then began he to utter the bitterest curses, and to swear, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.
040	MAT	026	075	And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, who had said unto him, Before the cock shall crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And going out, he wept bitterly.
040	MAT	027	001	NOW when the morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus how they might put him to death.
040	MAT	027	002	And having bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.
040	MAT	027	003	Then Judas who betrayed him, seeing that he was condemned, repenting, carried back the thirty silver pieces to the chief priests and the elders,
040	MAT	027	004	saying, I have sinned, in betraying innocent blood. But they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.
040	MAT	027	005	And throwing down the silver pieces in the temple, he departed; and going out, hanged himself.
040	MAT	027	006	Then the chief priests taking up the silver pieces, said, It is not lawful to put them to the treasure destined for sacred uses, because it is the price of blood.
040	MAT	027	007	So taking counsel, they bought with them a potter’s field, as a burial-place for strangers.
040	MAT	027	008	Therefore is that field called, The field of blood unto this day.
040	MAT	027	009	Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty silver pieces, the price of him who had been estimated at that rate, whom they of the children of Israel did value:
040	MAT	027	010	and gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord had ordered me.
040	MAT	027	011	Then was Jesus placed before the governor, and the governor interrogated him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? Then Jesus replied to him, Thou sayest true.
040	MAT	027	012	And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he made no reply.
040	MAT	027	013	Then saith Pilate to him, Hearest thou not how many things they testify against thee?
040	MAT	027	014	And he made him no reply, no not to a single word: so that the governor marvelled exceedingly.
040	MAT	027	015	Now at the feast, the governor had been accustomed to release one prisoner to the people, whomsoever they chose.
040	MAT	027	016	And they had at that time a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas.
040	MAT	027	017	Being therefore gathered around him, Pilate said to them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus called Messiah?
040	MAT	027	018	For he knew that out of envy they had delivered him up.
040	MAT	027	019	Then, as he was sitting on the tribunal, his wife sent a message to him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that righteous person; for I have suffered much to-day in a dream on his account.
040	MAT	027	020	But the chief priests and elders persuaded the populace that they should ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.
040	MAT	027	021	The governor repeating the question, said to them, Which of the two will ye that I release unto you? They said Barabbas.
040	MAT	027	022	Pilate saith unto them, What then shall I do with Jesus, who is called the Messiah? They all say to him, Let him be crucified.
040	MAT	027	023	The governor replied, But what evil hath he done? They cried out with greater vehemence, saying, Let him be crucified.
040	MAT	027	024	When Pilate saw that it was of no use to contend, but that rather a tumult was rising, he took water, and washed his hands before the people, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man: ye must answer for it.
040	MAT	027	025	Then all the people answering said, His blood be on us, and on our children.
040	MAT	027	026	Then he released unto them Barabbas: but having scourged Jesus, he delivered him up to be crucified.
040	MAT	027	027	Thereupon the soldiers of the governor taking Jesus away to the Praetorium, gathered around him the whole band:
040	MAT	027	028	and stripping him, put about him a scarlet cloak.
040	MAT	027	029	And platting a crown of thorns, they placed it on his head, and a cane in his right hand: and bowing the knee before him, mocked him, saying, Hail, king of the Jews!
040	MAT	027	030	And spitting upon him, they took the cane, and struck him upon his head.
040	MAT	027	031	And when they had insulted him, they took off from him the cloak, and put his own garments on him, and led him away to crucify him.
040	MAT	027	032	And as they were going out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name; him they compelled to carry his cross.
040	MAT	027	033	And when they were come to a place called Golgotha (which is called the place of a skull),
040	MAT	027	034	they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and having tasted it, he refused to drink.
040	MAT	027	035	Then having crucified him, they parted his garments, casting the lot: that it might be fulfilled, what was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and for my vesture they threw the lot.
040	MAT	027	036	And sitting down, they guarded him there.
040	MAT	027	037	And they placed over his head his accusation in writing, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
040	MAT	027	038	Then were crucified with him two robbers, one on his right hand, and the other on his left.
040	MAT	027	039	And they who were passing by reviled him, shaking their heads,
040	MAT	027	040	and saying, Thou that canst pull down the temple, and build it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, descend from the cross.
040	MAT	027	041	And with similar language also did the chief priests, insulting him, with the scribes and elders, and Pharisees,
040	MAT	027	042	say, He saved others, himself he is unable to save. If he be the King of Israel, let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe him.
040	MAT	027	043	He trusted in God; let him now deliver him, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.
040	MAT	027	044	And in the same manner also, did the robbers who were crucified with him, revile him.
040	MAT	027	045	Now from the fifth hour darkness fell upon all the land, unto the ninth hour.
040	MAT	027	046	But about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with an exceeding loud cry, saying, Eli! Eli! lama, sabacthani? that is, My God! my God! why hast thou forsaken me?
040	MAT	027	047	Then some of those who stood there, hearing him, said, This man is calling out for Elias.
040	MAT	027	048	And immediately one of them, running, and taking a sponge, and filling it with vinegar, and fastening it to a pole, put it to him to drink.
040	MAT	027	049	The others said, Let him alone, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.
040	MAT	027	050	Then Jesus crying again with a loud voice gave up the ghost.
040	MAT	027	051	And, lo! the vail of the temple was rent in two, from the upper part to the bottom; and the earth was shaken; and the rocks were rent;
040	MAT	027	052	and the sepulchres were opened; and many bodies of saints, who slept, arose;
040	MAT	027	053	and coming out of the sepulchres after his resurrection, entered into the holy city, and appeared unto many.
040	MAT	027	054	Then the centurion, and they who were with him, guarding Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things which were done, were exceedingly terrified, saying, Assuredly this was the Son of God.
040	MAT	027	055	Now there were many women on the spot, looking on at a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:
040	MAT	027	056	among whom was Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee’s children.
040	MAT	027	057	But when the evening was come, there came a rich man of Arimathea, whose name was Joseph, who himself also was a disciple of Jesus:
040	MAT	027	058	he going in to Pilate, begged for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered the body to be given him.
040	MAT	027	059	And Joseph receiving the body, wrapped it in clean linen;
040	MAT	027	060	and laid it in his own new sepulchre, which he had hewn out in a rock: and rolling a vast stone against the door of the sepulchre, departed.
040	MAT	027	061	And Mary Magdalen, and the other Mary, were there sitting opposite the sepulchre.
040	MAT	027	062	Now on the morrow, which is the day after the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came in a body to Pilate,
040	MAT	027	063	saying, Sir, we have reflected, that this deceiver, when yet alive, said, After three days I will rise again.
040	MAT	027	064	Command therefore that the sepulchre be made perfectly secure until the third day, lest his disciples coming by night, steal him, and say to the people, He is risen from the dead, so the last delusion would be worse than the first.
040	MAT	027	065	Then said Pilate unto them, Ye have a guard, go and make it as secure as ye think fit.
040	MAT	027	066	So they went and made the sepulchre secure, putting a seal upon the stone, after placing the guard.
040	MAT	028	001	NOW after the eve of the sabbath, as the light was dawning, towards the first day of the week, Mary Magdalen had come, and the other Mary, to view the sepulchre.
040	MAT	028	002	And, lo! there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descending from heaven, came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.
040	MAT	028	003	His aspect was as lightning, and his raiment white as snow.
040	MAT	028	004	And for fear of him the guards shook, and became as dead men.
040	MAT	028	005	Then the angel addressing them, said to the women, Fear not ye; for I know that ye are seeking Jesus who was crucified.
040	MAT	028	006	He is not here: he is risen, as he said. Come hither, behold the place where the Lord lay.
040	MAT	028	007	And go quickly, tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead: and, lo! he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.
040	MAT	028	008	And they went out quickly from the sepulchre with fear, and great joy; and ran to carry the tidings to his disciples.
040	MAT	028	009	And as they were going to tell the disciples, then behold Jesus met them saying, Hail! And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.
040	MAT	028	010	Then saith Jesus to them, Be not affrighted: go, tell my disciples that they go into Galilee, there shall they see me.
040	MAT	028	011	And as they were going, some of the guards who were come into the city, had told the chief priests all things which had happened.
040	MAT	028	012	And being assembled with the elders, and having held a council, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,
040	MAT	028	013	saying, Report, that his disciples coming by night stole him away, while you were asleep.
040	MAT	028	014	And if this comes to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him, and preserve you harmless.
040	MAT	028	015	So they took the money, and did as they were instructed. And this account is circulated among the Jews to this day.
040	MAT	028	016	Then the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain, where Jesus had ordered them.
040	MAT	028	017	And when they saw him, they worshipped him. Still some doubted.
040	MAT	028	018	Then Jesus approaching, spake to them, saying, All power is given me in heaven and upon earth.
040	MAT	028	019	Go therefore, make disciples among all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:
040	MAT	028	020	teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo! I am with you at all times even to the end of the world. Amen.

# BOOK	041	MAR	Mark	Mark
041	MAR	001	001	THE beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;
041	MAR	001	002	as it is written in the prophets; “Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, he shall prepare thy way before thee.
041	MAR	001	003	The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths strait.”
041	MAR	001	004	John was baptising in the wilderness, and preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.
041	MAR	001	005	And all the country of Judea went out to him, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptised by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
041	MAR	001	006	Now John was clothed with a camel’s hair garment, and a girdle of leather about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.
041	MAR	001	007	And he preached, saying, One mightier than I is coming after me, the string of whose shoes I am not worthy, stooping down, to unloose.
041	MAR	001	008	I indeed baptise you with water; but he shall baptise you with the Holy Ghost.
041	MAR	001	009	And it came to pass in those days, Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee, and was baptised of John in Jordan.
041	MAR	001	010	And immediately on going up from the water, he saw the heavens divided by a chasm, and the Spirit as a dove descending upon him:
041	MAR	001	011	and a voice came from heaven, Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased.
041	MAR	001	012	And immediately the Spirit impelled him to go into the wilderness.
041	MAR	001	013	And he was in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministred unto him.
041	MAR	001	014	But after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God:
041	MAR	001	015	and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God draweth nigh: repent, and believe the gospel.
041	MAR	001	016	And as he walked near the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.
041	MAR	001	017	And Jesus said to them, Come after me, and I will appoint you to be fishers of men:
041	MAR	001	018	and immediately leaving their nets, they followed him.
041	MAR	001	019	And going from thence a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, and others in the vessel mending the nets.
041	MAR	001	020	And immediately he called them: and leaving their father Zebedee in the vessel with the hirelings, they went after him.
041	MAR	001	021	And they entered into Capernaum; and immediately on the sabbath going into the synagogue, he taught.
041	MAR	001	022	And they were struck with astonishment at his doctrine; for he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.
041	MAR	001	023	And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,
041	MAR	001	024	saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.
041	MAR	001	025	And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be silent, and come out of him.
041	MAR	001	026	And the unclean spirit threw him into convulsions, and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.
041	MAR	001	027	And they were all in astonishment, so that they questioned one another, saying, What is this? what is this new doctrine? that with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him?
041	MAR	001	028	And there went out a report of him immediately into all the region of Galilee round about.
041	MAR	001	029	Then straitway going out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
041	MAR	001	030	But Simon’s wife’s mother lay in a fever, and immediately they informed him of her.
041	MAR	001	031	And he came and raised her up, and the fever left her immediately, and she waited upon them.
041	MAR	001	032	But when the evening was come, after the sun was set, they brought unto him all that had illnesses, and the demoniacs.
041	MAR	001	033	And the whole city was gathered together about the door;
041	MAR	001	034	and he healed many who were grievously afflicted with a variety of diseases; and he cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak for they knew him.
041	MAR	001	035	And very early (the night being far advanced towards morning) rising up, he went forth, and retired into a desert place, and there prayed.
041	MAR	001	036	And Simon, and those who were with him, eagerly pursued him;
041	MAR	001	037	and when they had found him, they say unto him, All men are inquiring after thee.
041	MAR	001	038	And he said unto them, Let us go into the neighbouring towns, that I may preach there also; for unto this purpose came I forth.
041	MAR	001	039	And he was preaching in their synagogues, through all Galilee, and casting out devils.
041	MAR	001	040	And there came to him a leper, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
041	MAR	001	041	Then Jesus, moved with compassion, stretching out his hand, touched him, and said to him, I will; be thou cleansed.
041	MAR	001	042	And as he spake, the leprosy instantly departed from him, and he was cleansed.
041	MAR	001	043	And giving him a strict charge, he immediately sent him away;
041	MAR	001	044	and said to him, Take care, that thou speak not a word to any man: but go, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy purification, what Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.
041	MAR	001	045	But he going out, began to proclaim it much, and to publish abroad an account of it, so that he could no more openly come into the city; but was without in desert places; and they came to him from all parts of the country.
041	MAR	002	001	AND again he entered into Capernaum after some days: and it was heard, that he was in the house;
041	MAR	002	002	and immediately many collected round him, so that there was no room, not even at the door; and he spake the word to them.
041	MAR	002	003	And they come to him, carrying a paralytic, borne of four:
041	MAR	002	004	and not being able to come nigh him because of the crowd, they stripped off the roofing of the house where he was; and having broken a way through, they let down with ropes the couch, on which the paralytic lay.
041	MAR	002	005	Then Jesus beholding their faith, saith to the paralytic, Son, thy sins are forgiven thee.
041	MAR	002	006	Now there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,
041	MAR	002	007	Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but the one God?
041	MAR	002	008	And instantly Jesus knowing by his spirit, that they reasoned thus among each other, said to them, Why reason ye about these things in your hearts?
041	MAR	002	009	Which is the easier thing, to say to a paralytic, Thy sins are forgiven thee; or to say, Arise and take up thy couch, and walk away?
041	MAR	002	010	But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority upon earth to forgive sins, he saith to the paralytic,
041	MAR	002	011	I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thy house.
041	MAR	002	012	And he arose instantly, and taking up his couch, went out before them all; so that they were all astonished, and glorified God, saying, We never before saw any thing like this.
041	MAR	002	013	And he went forth again to the sea side; and all the people came unto him; and he taught them.
041	MAR	002	014	And passing by, he saw Levi the son of Alpheus sitting at the custom-house, and he saith to him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him
041	MAR	002	015	And it came to pass, as he sat at table in his house, many publicans also, and sinners, sat down with Jesus and his disciples; for they were numerous, and they followed him.
041	MAR	002	016	And the scribes and the Pharisees seeing him eat with publicans and sinners, said to his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?
041	MAR	002	017	And when Jesus heard it, he said unto them, They who are in strong health have no need of a physician, but they who have illness: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
041	MAR	002	018	And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees kept fasts; and they came and said to him, Wherefore do the disciples of John, and of the Pharisees, fast? but thy disciples keep no fast.
041	MAR	002	019	And Jesus said to them, Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.
041	MAR	002	020	But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.
041	MAR	002	021	And no man seweth on a patch of cloth undressed upon an old garment: but if otherwise, the new piece supplied taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse.
041	MAR	002	022	And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; but if otherwise, the new wine will burst the bottles, and the wine will be spilt, and the bottles destroyed: but new wine must be put into new bottles.
041	MAR	002	023	And he was walking through the cornfields on the sabbath; and his disciples as they went on the road plucked the ears of corn.
041	MAR	002	024	And the Pharisees said to him, See, why are they doing on the sabbath, what is not lawful?
041	MAR	002	025	And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he was under necessity, and was hungry, himself and they who were with him?
041	MAR	002	026	How he entered into the house of God to Abiathar the high-priest; and did eat the shewbread, which it was not lawful for any to eat except the priests, and he gave also to those who were with him?
041	MAR	002	027	And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath.
041	MAR	002	028	Wherefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.
041	MAR	003	001	AND he entered again into the synagogue; and a man was there who had a withered hand.
041	MAR	003	002	And they watched him if he would cure him on the sabbath; that they might accuse him.
041	MAR	003	003	And he saith to the man who had the withered hand, Rise up in the midst.
041	MAR	003	004	And he saith to them, Is it lawful on the sabbath day to do good, or to do evil, to preserve life, or to kill? but they were silent.
041	MAR	003	005	Then looking round about on them with indignation, exceedingly grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith to the man, Stretch out thine hand; and he stretched it out: and his hand was restored sound as the other.
041	MAR	003	006	And the Pharisees instantly going out, held a council with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.
041	MAR	003	007	And Jesus retired with his disciples to the sea side; and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judea,
041	MAR	003	008	and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and from the farther side of Jordan; and they around Tyre and Sidon, a vast multitude, when they heard what wonders he did, came unto him.
041	MAR	003	009	And he spoke to his disciples that a little boat should be ready for him, because of the crowd, lest they should press upon him:
041	MAR	003	010	for he healed many; insomuch, that they thronged in upon him, that they might touch him, as many as had afflictive diseases.
041	MAR	003	011	And the unclean spirits, when they beheld him, fell down before him, and cried out saying, Thou art the Son of God.
041	MAR	003	012	And he repeatedly charged them, that they should not make him known.
041	MAR	003	013	And he went up into a mountain, and called to him those whom he chose; and they came to him.
041	MAR	003	014	And he appointed twelve to be with him, and to send them out to preach:
041	MAR	003	015	and to have authority to cure diseases, and to cast out devils:
041	MAR	003	016	and Simon he surnamed Peter;
041	MAR	003	017	and James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and surnamed them Boanerges, that is, sons of thunder:
041	MAR	003	018	and Andrew and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Canaanite,
041	MAR	003	019	and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him: and they came into an house.
041	MAR	003	020	And the multitude came together again, so that they were not able even to eat bread.
041	MAR	003	021	And when his relations heard it, they went out to restrain him, for they said, He is transported beyond all bounds.
041	MAR	003	022	And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem, said, He hath Beelzebub, and by this prince of the devils doth he cast out devils.
041	MAR	003	023	So calling them to him, he spake to them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?
041	MAR	003	024	Even if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand:
041	MAR	003	025	and if a family be divided against itself, that family cannot be established.
041	MAR	003	026	So if Satan rise up against himself, and is divided, he cannot subsist, but cometh to an end.
041	MAR	003	027	No man entering into his house, can plunder a strong man’s goods, unless he first bind the strong man, then indeed he spoileth his house.
041	MAR	003	028	Verily I say unto you, That all sins shall be forgiven to the sons of men, and the blasphemies, whatsoever they may blaspheme:
041	MAR	003	029	but whosoever shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost, hath no forgiveness to eternity, but is adjudged to everlasting damnation.
041	MAR	003	030	Because they said, he hath an unclean spirit.
041	MAR	003	031	Then came his brethren and his mother, and standing without sent unto him, calling aloud for him.
041	MAR	003	032	And the multitude sat around him, and they said to him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without are asking for thee.
041	MAR	003	033	And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother or my brethren?
041	MAR	003	034	And looking about on those who were sitting in a circle round him, he saith, Behold my mother and my brethren!
041	MAR	003	035	For whosoever shall do the will of God, that person is my brother, and my sister, and mother.
041	MAR	004	001	AND again he began to teach by the sea side: and a vast multitude was assembled about him, so that he went into a vessel to sit down on the sea, and all the multitude was on the land close by the sea.
041	MAR	004	002	And he taught them in parables many things, and said unto them in the course of his teaching,
041	MAR	004	003	Hear me! Behold, a sower went out to sow;
041	MAR	004	004	and it came to pass as he sowed, some fell by the road side, and the birds of the air came and ate it up.
041	MAR	004	005	And some fell on a rocky soil, where it had not much mold, and immediately it sprung up, because it had no depth of earth:
041	MAR	004	006	and when the sun arose it was scorched up; and because it had not root, it withered away.
041	MAR	004	007	And some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up with it and choked it, and it produced no fruit.
041	MAR	004	008	And some fell on good ground, and produced fruit, growing up, and increasing, and yielded one part thirty fold, and another sixty, and another an hundred.
041	MAR	004	009	And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
041	MAR	004	010	But when they were alone, those who were about him with the twelve, asked him the meaning of the parable.
041	MAR	004	011	And he said to them, To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God; but to those who are without, all things are in parables:
041	MAR	004	012	That seeing they may see, yet not perceive; and hearing may hear, yet not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins be forgiven them.
041	MAR	004	013	And he saith to them, Know ye not this parable? and how will ye know all parables?
041	MAR	004	014	The sower soweth the word.
041	MAR	004	015	Now these are they by the road side; where the word is sown; and when they have heard, immediately Satan cometh, and taketh away the word sown on their hearts:
041	MAR	004	016	and these in like manner are they who were sown on the rocky soil; who when they have heard the word, instantly with joy receive it;
041	MAR	004	017	and have no root in themselves, but are temporary professors: afterwards, when tribulation cometh or persecution for the word’s sake, immediately they are offended.
041	MAR	004	018	And those are the sown among the thorns; such as are hearers of the word;
041	MAR	004	019	but the anxious cares of this world, and the seducing nature of wealth, and inordinate desires after other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.
041	MAR	004	020	And these are they who are sown on the good ground, such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirty fold, and some sixty, and some an hundred.
041	MAR	004	021	And he said unto them, Is a lamp brought out to be put under a bushel, or under a bed, and not to be placed on a stand?
041	MAR	004	022	For there is nothing hid, but that it should be brought to light, nor is any thing concealed, but that it should come into open day.
041	MAR	004	023	If any man hath ears to hear, let him hear.
041	MAR	004	024	And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with the measure ye mete, shall it be measured back to you; and something over shall be given to you that hear.
041	MAR	004	025	For to him that hath, there shall more be given to him; but he that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away from him.
041	MAR	004	026	And he said, The kingdom of heaven is of that kind, as if a man should cast seed into his field;
041	MAR	004	027	and sleep and rise, night and day, and the sown corn should sprout, and grow into length, he knoweth not how:
041	MAR	004	028	for the earth, naturally prolific, beareth fruit; first the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the ear.
041	MAR	004	029	But when the grain is ready, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because harvest is come.
041	MAR	004	030	And he said, To what shall I liken the kingdom of God, and under what parabolic figure shall I represent it?
041	MAR	004	031	It is like a grain of mustard, which when it is sown in the earth, is among the least of all the seeds which are upon the earth:
041	MAR	004	032	but when it is sown, it groweth up and becomes greater than all herbaceous plants, and produceth vast branches; so that the birds of the air may roost under the shadow of it.
041	MAR	004	033	And with many such like parables spake he to them the word.
041	MAR	004	034	And without a parable spake he not unto them; but in private he explained them all to his disciples.
041	MAR	004	035	And the same day he saith unto them, as the evening shut in, Let us pass over to the other side.
041	MAR	004	036	And sending the multitude away, they took him just as he was in the vessel; and there were also some other little vessels with him.
041	MAR	004	037	And a great hurricane arose, and the waves broke into the vessel, so that it was now full of water:
041	MAR	004	038	and he was in the stern, sleeping on a pillow: and they awoke him, and say unto him, Master, is it no concern to thee that we are perishing?
041	MAR	004	039	And rising, he with authority charged the wind, and said to the sea, Silence! be still! And the wind subsided, and there was a great calm.
041	MAR	004	040	And he said to them, Why are ye so timorous? How is it that ye have not confidence?
041	MAR	004	041	And they were filled with the most reverential awe, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?
041	MAR	005	001	AND they came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.
041	MAR	005	002	And as he was going out of the vessel, immediately there met him a man with an unclean spirit,
041	MAR	005	003	coming out of the tombs; who had his abode among the tombs; and no man could secure him, not even with chains;
041	MAR	005	004	for he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains were burst asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces, and no man was able to master him:
041	MAR	005	005	and continually night and day he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, screaming, and cutting himself with stones.
041	MAR	005	006	But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,
041	MAR	005	007	and crying with a loud voice, said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus thou Son of God most high? I adjure thee by God, that thou dost not send me to torment.
041	MAR	005	008	(For he had said unto him, Come out, unclean spirit, from the man.)
041	MAR	005	009	And he interrogated him, What is thy name? and he replied, saying, Legion is my name; for we are many.
041	MAR	005	010	And he entreated him much that he would not send them out of the country.
041	MAR	005	011	And a great herd of swine was there feeding on the mountain:
041	MAR	005	012	and all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.
041	MAR	005	013	And immediately Jesus permitted them. And the unclean spirits going forth, entered into the swine; and the herd rushed violently down a precipice into the sea (they were about two thousand), and were suffocated in the sea.
041	MAR	005	014	Then the swineherds fled, and carried the tidings into the city and into the country. And they went out to see what was done.
041	MAR	005	015	And they came to Jesus, and saw the demoniac that had the legion, seated and clothed, and in his sound mind: and they were afraid.
041	MAR	005	016	And they who saw the transaction, told them how it had been with the demoniac, and concerning the swine.
041	MAR	005	017	And they began to entreat him to depart out of their coasts.
041	MAR	005	018	And when he embarked on board the vessel, the demoniac besought him, that he might go with him.
041	MAR	005	019	But Jesus did not permit him, but said to him, Go to thine house, and to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee.
041	MAR	005	020	And he went out, and began to publish in Decapolis, what great things Jesus had done for him: and all men marvelled.
041	MAR	005	021	And when Jesus had passed over again in the vessel to the other side, a vast multitude came together unto him; and he was by the sea side.
041	MAR	005	022	And, behold, there cometh to him one of the rulers of the synagogue, named Jairus; and seeing him, fell at his feet,
041	MAR	005	023	and entreated him importunately, saying, My little daughter is at the last gasp; wilt thou come, and lay thy hands upon her, that she may recover, and she shall live.
041	MAR	005	024	And he went with him: and there followed him a great crowd, and they thronged him.
041	MAR	005	025	And a certain woman, having a flux of blood twelve years,
041	MAR	005	026	and had suffered much from many physicians; and had expended all she had, and was nothing better, but rather growing worse and worse;
041	MAR	005	027	when she heard of Jesus, came in the crowd behind him, and touched his garment:
041	MAR	005	028	for she said, If I but touch his clothes, I shall recover.
041	MAR	005	029	And instantly the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was cured of her afflictive disease.
041	MAR	005	030	And Jesus immediately perceiving in himself that miraculous power had gone forth from him, turning about in the crowd, said, Who touched my garments?
041	MAR	005	031	And his disciples said to him, Thou seest the crowd thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?
041	MAR	005	032	And he looked round to see her who had done this.
041	MAR	005	033	Then the woman, fearful and trembling, knowing what had been done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.
041	MAR	005	034	And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace, and be whole from thy distressing disease.
041	MAR	005	035	And while he was yet speaking, they came from the ruler of the synagogue’s house, saying, Thy daughter is dead; why dost thou trouble the master any further?
041	MAR	005	036	But Jesus, instantly hearing the account given, said to the ruler of the synagogue, Fear not, only believe.
041	MAR	005	037	And he permitted no person to follow him, but Peter, and James, and John a brother of James.
041	MAR	005	038	And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the confusion, as they were greatly lamenting and making loud moanings.
041	MAR	005	039	And entering in he saith, Why make ye this uproar, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.
041	MAR	005	040	And they derided him; but he thrusting them all out, took the father and the mother of the maiden, and those who were with him, and went in where the damsel was laid out.
041	MAR	005	041	And taking the hand of the damsel, he saith unto her, Talitha cumi! which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise!
041	MAR	005	042	And immediately the damsel arose and walked about, for she was twelve years old. And they were astonished with vast astonishment.
041	MAR	005	043	And he very strongly charged them that no person should know it; and ordered something to be given her to eat.
041	MAR	006	001	AND he went out thence, and came into his native country; and his disciples followed him.
041	MAR	006	002	And when the sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many when they heard him were amazed, saying, Whence hath this man these things? and what is the wisdom given to him, that even such miracles are done by his hands?
041	MAR	006	003	Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James and Joses, and Judah and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.
041	MAR	006	004	Then said Jesus unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his native place, and among his relations, and in his own family.
041	MAR	006	005	And he could not do there any miracle, except that laying his hands on a few sick persons he cured them.
041	MAR	006	006	And he marvelled at their infidelity. And he went about the villages around, teaching.
041	MAR	006	007	And called the twelve, and began to send them two and two, and gave them authority over unclean spirits.
041	MAR	006	008	And he commanded them, that they should take nothing for the journey, except a staff only; neither scrip, nor bread, nor even brass money in their purse:
041	MAR	006	009	wearing sandals, and not to be clothed with two coats.
041	MAR	006	010	And he said unto them, Wheresoever ye enter into a family, there abide until ye depart thence.
041	MAR	006	011	And as many as shall not receive you, neither hearken to you, when ye go from thence, shake off the dust from beneath your feet, for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city.
041	MAR	006	012	And going forth, they preached, that men should repent.
041	MAR	006	013	And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many sick persons, and cured them.
041	MAR	006	014	And king Herod heard it (for his name was celebrated), and he said, This is John the Baptist, he is risen from the dead, and therefore miracles are wrought by him.
041	MAR	006	015	Others said, That it is Elias; and others said, He is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.
041	MAR	006	016	But when Herod heard it, he said, This is John whom I beheaded; he is risen from the dead.
041	MAR	006	017	For Herod himself had sent and seized upon John, and bound him in prison, for Herodias’ sake, his brother Philip’s wife; because he had married her.
041	MAR	006	018	For John said to Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother’s wife.
041	MAR	006	019	Therefore Herodias bore him a rooted resentment, and would have slain him; yet could not:
041	MAR	006	020	for Herod feared John, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man; and paid great attention to him and when he heard him, did many things, and heard him with delight.
041	MAR	006	021	And a favourable day being come for her purpose, when Herod on his birth-day made a supper for his nobles, and military commanders, and the principal personages of Galilee;
041	MAR	006	022	and the daughter of this Herodias coming in, and dancing, and delighting Herod, and his company, the king said to the damsel, Ask me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee.
041	MAR	006	023	And he swore unto her, That whatsoever thou shalt ask, I will give thee, even to the half of my kingdom.
041	MAR	006	024	Then she went out and said to her mother, What shall I ask? and she said, The head of John the Baptist.
041	MAR	006	025	And she came in immediately with eagerness to the king, and asked, saying, I desire that thou wilt give me on the spot, in a charger, the head of John the Baptist.
041	MAR	006	026	And the king was exceedingly sorry; yet on account of his oath, and those who sat with him, he would not refuse her.
041	MAR	006	027	And the king immediately sending a centinel, commanded his head to be brought thither: and he went, and beheaded him in the prison,
041	MAR	006	028	and brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel, and the damsel gave it to her mother.
041	MAR	006	029	And when his disciples heard it, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a sepulchre.
041	MAR	006	030	And the disciples came together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.
041	MAR	006	031	And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and repose a little while: for there were multitudes coming and going, so that they had not even time to eat.
041	MAR	006	032	And they went into a desert place in a vessel privately.
041	MAR	006	033	And the multitudes observed them going off, and many knew him, and ran thither on foot out of all the cities, and got before them, and came together unto him.
041	MAR	006	034	And Jesus, when he landed, saw a vast multitude, and was moved with companion towards them, for they were as sheep having no shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.
041	MAR	006	035	And when great part of the day was already gone, his disciples coming to him said, This is a desert place, and much of the day is already gone:
041	MAR	006	036	send them away, that they may go into the country places and villages around, and buy themselves bread; for they have nothing to eat.
041	MAR	006	037	But he answering said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy the value of two hundred denarii, in loaves, and give them to eat?
041	MAR	006	038	But he said to them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they said, Five, and two fishes.
041	MAR	006	039	And he commanded them to seat them all by companies on the green grass:
041	MAR	006	040	and they lay along row against row, a hundred deep, and fifty wide.
041	MAR	006	041	And taking the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to the disciples, that they should set them before them, and the two fishes he divided among them all.
041	MAR	006	042	And they did all eat, and were filled:
041	MAR	006	043	and they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes.
041	MAR	006	044	And they who did eat of the loaves, were about five thousand men.
041	MAR	006	045	And immediately he compelled his disciples to go on board the vessel, and to go before him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he sent the multitude away.
041	MAR	006	046	And having bid them farewell, he went into a mountain to pray.
041	MAR	006	047	And when the evening was come, the vessel was in the midst of the sea, and himself alone on the land.
041	MAR	006	048	And he saw them greatly fatigued with rowing, for the wind was contrary to them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh to them, walking upon the sea, and seemed intending to pass by them.
041	MAR	006	049	But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they thought it was an apparition, and screamed out:
041	MAR	006	050	for they all saw him, and were greatly agitated: and straitway he spoke to them, and said, Take courage, it is I, be not terrified.
041	MAR	006	051	And he went up to them into the vessel, and the wind ceased and they were beyond all imagination amazed in themselves, and lost in wonder.
041	MAR	006	052	For they reflected not upon the loaves, for their heart was hardened.
041	MAR	006	053	And when they had passed over, they came to the land of Gennesareth, and went on shore.
041	MAR	006	054	And when they came out of the vessel, immediately perceiving him,
041	MAR	006	055	running through all parts of that country, they began to carry about on couches those who were afflicted with diseases, wherever they heard that he was.
041	MAR	006	056	And wherever they entered into villages or cities, or country places, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch, if but the fringe on his garment; and as many as touched it, were cured.
041	MAR	007	001	AND the Pharisees, and some of the scribes, who came from Jerusalem, collected together around him.
041	MAR	007	002	And seeing some of his disciples eating bread with hands unclean, that is, unwashed, they found fault.
041	MAR	007	003	For the Pharisees and all the Jews, unless they wash their hands to the wrist, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.
041	MAR	007	004	And coming from the market, unless they have washed, they never eat. And there are many other things which they have by tradition received to observe, as the washings of cups, and pots, and vessels of brass, and couches.
041	MAR	007	005	Then the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, Why do not thy disciples walk conformable to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashed hands?
041	MAR	007	006	Then he answering said to them, Well did Isaiah prophesy concerning you hypocrites, as it is written, “This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.
041	MAR	007	007	Now vainly do they worship me, while teaching doctrines the commandments of men.”
041	MAR	007	008	For leaving the command of God, ye adhere to the tradition of men, the washings of pots and cups; and many other such like things ye practise.
041	MAR	007	009	And he said to them, Strangely do ye make void the command of God, that ye may observe your tradition.
041	MAR	007	010	For Moses said, “Honour thy father and thy mother:” and “he that curseth father or mother, let him assuredly be put to death.”
041	MAR	007	011	But ye affirm, If a man say to his father or mother, it is Corban (that is, a gift), which otherwise might have been advantageous to thee from me;
041	MAR	007	012	then ye permit him no more to do any thing for his father, or his mother;
041	MAR	007	013	abrogating the word of God by the tradition, which ye have transmitted down; and many such like things ye do.
041	MAR	007	014	And he called to him all the multitude, and said unto them, hear me all of you, and understand.
041	MAR	007	015	There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him, can make him unclean: but the things which come out from him, these are the things which make a man unclean.
041	MAR	007	016	If any man hath ears to hear, let him hear.
041	MAR	007	017	And when he was come into the house from the multitude, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.
041	MAR	007	018	And he saith to them, Are ye also so defective of intelligence? Do you not consider, that every thing from without that entereth into a man, cannot make him unclean?
041	MAR	007	019	because it entereth not into his heart, but into his belly, and goeth out into the vault, carrying off all the impurities of the food.
041	MAR	007	020	But, said he, what cometh out of a man, that makes a man unclean.
041	MAR	007	021	For from within out of the heart of men proceed wicked reasonings, adulteries, whoredoms, murders,
041	MAR	007	022	thefts, inordinate cravings, mischievous actions, knavery, lewdness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, folly:
041	MAR	007	023	all these wicked things come from within, and render a person unclean.
041	MAR	007	024	And rising, he departed thence into the confines of Tyre and Sidon; and entering into a house, desired that no man should know it: yet he could not be hid.
041	MAR	007	025	For a woman hearing of him, whose daughter had an unclean spirit, came and fell at his feet.
041	MAR	007	026	The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by birth, and she entreated him that the devil might be cast out of her daughter.
041	MAR	007	027	And Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be fed, for it is not proper to take the children’s bread, and throw it to the dogs.
041	MAR	007	028	But she replied, and said to him, True, Lord, yet the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs.
041	MAR	007	029	And he said unto her, For this speech, go home, the devil is gone out of thy daughter.
041	MAR	007	030	And going to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid on a couch.
041	MAR	007	031	And again departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.
041	MAR	007	032	And they bring him a deaf man, who could scarcely articulate; and they entreat him to put his hand upon him.
041	MAR	007	033	And he took him aside out of the crowd, and put his fingers into his ears, and spitting, he touched his tongue;
041	MAR	007	034	and looking up to heaven, he heaved a deep sigh, and saith unto him, Ephphatha! that is, Be opened.
041	MAR	007	035	And instantly his ears were opened, and the tie of his tongue loosed, and he spake distinctly.
041	MAR	007	036	And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged, the more abundantly they published it abroad.
041	MAR	007	037	And they were astonished beyond all imagination, saying, He hath done all things admirably; he maketh even the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.
041	MAR	008	001	IN those days the multitude being exceedingly great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus calling his disciples to him, said unto them,
041	MAR	008	002	I have compassion on the multitude, for they have stayed with me already three days, and have nothing to eat:
041	MAR	008	003	and if I send them away fasting to their houses, they will faint on the road; for many of them came from a great distance.
041	MAR	008	004	His disciples answered him, Whence can a man here in the desert satisfy these with bread?
041	MAR	008	005	And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.
041	MAR	008	006	And he commanded the multitude to recline in order on the ground: and taking the seven loaves, having given thanks he brake them, and gave to his disciples, that they should set before the people; and they distributed them to the multitude.
041	MAR	008	007	And they had a few small fishes; and blessing, he commanded to set these also before them.
041	MAR	008	008	And they did eat and were filled and they took up what remained of the fragments, seven baskets.
041	MAR	008	009	And the persons who had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.
041	MAR	008	010	And immediately going into the vessel with his disciples, he came into the coasts of Dalmanutha.
041	MAR	008	011	Then the Pharisees came out, and began to question him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.
041	MAR	008	012	And fetching a deep sigh from his very soul, he saith, Why seeketh this generation a sign? verily I tell you, no sign shall be given to this generation.
041	MAR	008	013	And leaving them, going again on board the vessel, he departed to the other side.
041	MAR	008	014	And they had forgotten to take bread, and had not with them in the vessel but a single loaf.
041	MAR	008	015	And he earnestly charged them, saying, Beware, take heed of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.
041	MAR	008	016	And they talked the matter over among themselves, saying, This is because we have no loaves of bread.
041	MAR	008	017	And Jesus knowing it said unto them, Why reason ye together, because ye have no loaves? Do ye not yet consider, nor understand? Have ye your heart yet hardened?
041	MAR	008	018	Having eyes, do ye not see? and having ears, do ye not hear? and do ye not remember?
041	MAR	008	019	When I broke the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.
041	MAR	008	020	And when the seven loaves among the four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They said, Seven.
041	MAR	008	021	And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?
041	MAR	008	022	And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring him a blind man, and entreat him that he would touch him.
041	MAR	008	023	And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him without the city; and spitting on his eyes, he laid his hands upon him, and asked him if he saw aught.
041	MAR	008	024	And looking up, he said, I see men walking, as trees.
041	MAR	008	025	Then again he put his hands upon his eyes, and made him look up again: and he was entirely restored, and saw all men distinctly.
041	MAR	008	026	And he sent him away unto his own house, saying, Neither enter thou into the city, nor speak to any in the city.
041	MAR	008	027	And Jesus and his disciples went out into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and on the road he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Who do men say that I am?
041	MAR	008	028	And they answered, John the Baptist: others say, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.
041	MAR	008	029	And he said unto them, But who do ye say that I am? Then Peter answering, said unto him, Thou art the Messiah.
041	MAR	008	030	And he strictly enjoined them, that they should tell no man of this.
041	MAR	008	031	And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, and chief priests, and scribes, and be slain, and after three days rise again.
041	MAR	008	032	And he spake this saying openly. And Peter taking him aside, began to remonstrate with him.
041	MAR	008	033	But he turned himself around, and seeing his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou dost not relish the things which are of God, but those that are of men.
041	MAR	008	034	Then calling to him the multitude, with his disciples, he said to them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
041	MAR	008	035	For whosoever would preserve his life shall lose it; but whosoever would lose his life for my sake and the Gospel, he shall preserve it.
041	MAR	008	036	For what would it profit a man, though he should gain the whole world, if he be punished with the loss of his own soul?
041	MAR	008	037	Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
041	MAR	008	038	For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, before this adulterous and sinful generation; of him will the Son of man also be ashamed, when he shall come in the glory of his Father, with the holy angels.
041	MAR	009	001	AND he said unto them, I tell you of a certainty, that there are some standing here who shall not taste of death, until they see the kingdom of God come with power.
041	MAR	009	002	And six days after Jesus taketh with him Peter and James and John, only, and carrieth them up with him into an exceeding high mountain in great privacy; and was transfigured before them.
041	MAR	009	003	His garments became glistering, exceeding white, like snow; such as no fuller upon earth can whiten.
041	MAR	009	004	And there appeared to him Elias with Moses: and they were conversing with Jesus.
041	MAR	009	005	Then Peter addressing him, said unto him, Master, it is desirable for us to be here: and let us erect three tents, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.
041	MAR	009	006	For he knew not what he should say: for they were very much affrighted.
041	MAR	009	007	And there came a cloud overshadowing them: and there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.
041	MAR	009	008	And instantly looking round, they saw no man any longer with them, but Jesus only.
041	MAR	009	009	And as they were coming down from the mountain, he strictly charged them, that they should tell no man what they had seen, till after the Son of man should have arisen from the dead.
041	MAR	009	010	And they caught at that word, considering among themselves what this rising from the dead could mean.
041	MAR	009	011	And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes, that Elias must come first?
041	MAR	009	012	Then he answering said unto them, Elias indeed cometh first, and will reform all things; and how speaks the scripture of the Son of man? That he must suffer many things, and be treated with contempt.
041	MAR	009	013	But I say unto you, that Elias is come, and they have done to him whatsoever they chose, as it is written of him.
041	MAR	009	014	And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great crowd around them, and the scribes disputing with them.
041	MAR	009	015	And immediately all the multitude, when they beheld him, were struck with amazement, and coming to him, saluted him.
041	MAR	009	016	And he asked the scribes, What are ye disputing about among yourselves?
041	MAR	009	017	And one of the people addressing him, said, Master, I have brought my son to thee, who hath a dumb spirit;
041	MAR	009	018	and wherever he seizeth him, he throws him into strong convulsions: and he foams at the mouth, and grinds his teeth, and pines away. And I spoke to thy disciples, that they should cast him out; and they were unable.
041	MAR	009	019	Then addressing him, he said, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you? bring him to me.
041	MAR	009	020	And they brought him unto him. And seeing him, instantly the spirit threw him into convulsions; and falling to the ground, he rolled about, foaming at the mouth.
041	MAR	009	021	And he asked his father, For how long a time hath this been the case with him? And he replied, From his infancy.
041	MAR	009	022	And often it hath cast him into the fire, and into water, to destroy him: but if thou art able, have compassion upon us, and help us.
041	MAR	009	023	Then said Jesus unto him, This is the point: if thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.
041	MAR	009	024	And immediately the father of the child said with tears, I believe, Lord! help my unbelief!
041	MAR	009	025	Then Jesus, seeing that the multitude were running up to him, rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I command thee, come out of him, and enter into him no more.
041	MAR	009	026	And screaming, and convulsing him violently, it came out: and the child lay as if dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead.
041	MAR	009	027	But Jesus taking him by the hand, raised him up; and he arose.
041	MAR	009	028	And when he was come into the house, the disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast it out?
041	MAR	009	029	And he said to them, this kind can be driven out by nothing but prayer and fasting.
041	MAR	009	030	And going from thence, they passed through Galilee: and he would not have any person know it.
041	MAR	009	031	For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him: and after being killed, the third day he shall rise again.
041	MAR	009	032	But they understood not the meaning of that declaration, and were afraid to ask him.
041	MAR	009	033	And he came to Capernaum: and when he was in the house, he asked them, What was the subject of your dispute among yourselves on the road?
041	MAR	009	034	But they held their peace. For they had been disputing with each other on the road, which was the greatest.
041	MAR	009	035	And when he was seated, he called the twelve, and saith to them, If any man desires to be the first, let him be last of all, and servant of all.
041	MAR	009	036	And taking a little boy, he set him in the midst of them: and taking him in his arms, he said unto them,
041	MAR	009	037	Whosoever shall receive one of such little children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever receiveth me, receiveth not me merely, but him that sent me.
041	MAR	009	038	Then John addressed him, saying, Master, we saw a person in thy name casting out devils, who followeth us not: and we forbad him, because he did not follow us.
041	MAR	009	039	Then said Jesus, Forbid him not: for there is no man who shall perform a miracle in my name, who will be able presently after to speak evil of me.
041	MAR	009	040	For he that is not against us, is for us.
041	MAR	009	041	For whosoever shall give you even a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to the Messiah, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.
041	MAR	009	042	And whosoever shall give occasion of offence to one of these little ones who believe in me, it were desirable for him rather that a milestone were hanged about his neck, and that he were cast into the sea.
041	MAR	009	043	And if thy hand cause thee to offend, cut it off: it were better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having both hands to go into hell, into the fire that never will be quenched:
041	MAR	009	044	where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
041	MAR	009	045	And if thy foot cause thee to offend, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life halting, than having both feet to be cast into hell, into the fire which never can be quenched:
041	MAR	009	046	where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
041	MAR	009	047	And if thine eye cause thee to offend, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into the fire of hell:
041	MAR	009	048	where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
041	MAR	009	049	For every one shall be salted with fire, and every victim shall be sprinkled with salt.
041	MAR	009	050	Salt is good: but if the salt become insipid, with what will you season it? have salt in yourselves, and live in peace with each other.
041	MAR	010	001	AND arising, he went from thence into the coasts of Judea, through the country on the other side of the Jordan; and again the multitudes came together unto him; and as his custom was, he again taught them.
041	MAR	010	002	And the Pharisees coming to him, put a question to him, Is it lawful for a husband to put away his wife? tempting him.
041	MAR	010	003	He answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you?
041	MAR	010	004	They said, Moses permitted to write a bill of divorce, and to put her away.
041	MAR	010	005	Then Jesus answering said unto them, For the hardness of your hearts he wrote you that ordinance.
041	MAR	010	006	But from the beginning of the creation, God made them male and female;
041	MAR	010	007	and said, For this cause shall a man forsake father and mother, and shall adhere to his wife;
041	MAR	010	008	and they two shall be one flesh: so that they are no more two, but one flesh.
041	MAR	010	009	What therefore God hath yoked together, let no man separate.
041	MAR	010	010	And in the house the disciples again asked him of this matter.
041	MAR	010	011	And he said unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her:
041	MAR	010	012	and if a wife put away her husband, and marrieth another, she committeth adultery.
041	MAR	010	013	And they brought unto him little children, that he should touch them: but his disciples rebuked those who brought them.
041	MAR	010	014	But when Jesus saw it, he felt indignation, and said to them, Permit little children to come to me, and hinder them not; for of such is the kingdom of heaven.
041	MAR	010	015	Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall in nowise enter into it.
041	MAR	010	016	And he took them in his arms, and laying his hand upon them, gave them his benediction.
041	MAR	010	017	And as he went out to the road, a person ran to him, and kneeling down, asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?
041	MAR	010	018	Then said Jesus unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, even God.
041	MAR	010	019	Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery; Do not murder; Do not steal; Do not bear false witness; Honour thy father and mother.
041	MAR	010	020	Then he replying, said, Master, all these things have I observed from my youth.
041	MAR	010	021	Then Jesus looking upon him, loved him, and said to him, In one thing thou art defective: go, sell all that thou hast, and give to the poor; and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up thy cross, and follow me.
041	MAR	010	022	And groaning over this speech, he went away sorrowful: for he had many estates.
041	MAR	010	023	And Jesus looking round, said to his disciples, How difficultly shall they who have riches enter into the kingdom of God!
041	MAR	010	024	Then his disciples were astonished at these words. But Jesus again addressing them, said unto them, Children, how difficult is it for those who trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!
041	MAR	010	025	It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
041	MAR	010	026	And they were exceedingly amazed, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?
041	MAR	010	027	And Jesus looking upon them, said, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.
041	MAR	010	028	And Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.
041	MAR	010	029	Then Jesus in reply said, Verily I say unto you, there is no man who hath left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake and the Gospel’s,
041	MAR	010	030	who shall not receive an hundred-fold more now, at this very time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecution, and in the world to come life everlasting.
041	MAR	010	031	But many first, will be last; and the last, first.
041	MAR	010	032	And they were on the road going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was advancing before them: and they were astonished; and followed him full of fear. And again taking the twelve aside, he began to tell them what things were about to befall him:
041	MAR	010	033	For, lo! said he, we are going up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man will be betrayed to the chief priests, and to the scribes; and they will condemn him to death, and will deliver him to the Gentiles:
041	MAR	010	034	and they will insult him, and scourge him, and spit upon him, and kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.
041	MAR	010	035	And James and John the sons of Zebedee came to him, saying, Master, we desire that thou shouldst do for us whatsoever we request.
041	MAR	010	036	He said unto them, What will ye that I should do for you?
041	MAR	010	037	They say unto him, Grant us to sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left, in thy glory.
041	MAR	010	038	Then Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup which I drink? and be baptised with the baptism with which I am baptised?
041	MAR	010	039	And they said unto him, We are able. Then said Jesus unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup of which I drink; and be baptised with the baptism with which I am baptised:
041	MAR	010	040	but to sit on my right-hand, and on my left, is not mine to give; but to those for whom it is prepared.
041	MAR	010	041	And when the ten heard it, they began to be indignant against James and John.
041	MAR	010	042	But Jesus called them, and said to them, Ye know that they who appear to rule over the Gentiles, lord it over them; and their great men exercise dominion over them.
041	MAR	010	043	But it shall not be so with you: but whosoever will be great among you let him be your servant:
041	MAR	010	044	and whosoever will be first, let him be the servant of all.
041	MAR	010	045	For the Son of man came not to be waited upon, but to be a servant, and to give his life a ransom for many.
041	MAR	010	046	And they came to Jericho. And as he was going out of Jericho with his disciples, and a great multitude, Bartimeus, the blind, the son of Timeus, sat by the road-side begging:
041	MAR	010	047	and hearing that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by, he began to cry out, and say, O Son of David, Jesus, have mercy on me!
041	MAR	010	048	And many chid him, that he should be silent: but he cried out so much the more, Son of David, have mercy on me!
041	MAR	010	049	And Jesus stood still, and ordered him to be called: and they call the blind man, saying to him, Cheer up, arise; he calleth thee.
041	MAR	010	050	Then casting off his cloak, he arose, and came to Jesus.
041	MAR	010	051	And Jesus addressing him, said, What dost thou wish that I should do for thee? And the blind man said to him, Rabboni, that I may receive my sight!
041	MAR	010	052	Then said Jesus unto him, Go thy way: thy faith hath saved thee. And immediately he received sight, and followed Jesus in the road.
041	MAR	011	001	AND when he drew nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, to the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,
041	MAR	011	002	and saith unto them, Go into the village opposite to you: and immediately as you enter it, you will find a foal tied, on which no man yet hath rode; loose him, and bring him hither.
041	MAR	011	003	And if any man say to you, Why do ye this? say, That the Lord hath need of it; and immediately he will send it hither.
041	MAR	011	004	And they went, and found the foal tied to a gate without, where two ways met; and they untie him.
041	MAR	011	005	Then some of those who stood by, said unto them, What are ye about, untying the colt?
041	MAR	011	006	Then they said unto them, as Jesus commanded them: and they permitted them to do it.
041	MAR	011	007	And they brought the colt to Jesus, and put on him their garments; and he rode upon it.
041	MAR	011	008	And multitudes spread their garments on the road: and others cut off boughs from the trees, and strewed them on the road.
041	MAR	011	009	And they who went before, and who followed after, cried, saying, Hosanna: blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
041	MAR	011	010	Blessed be the kingdom of our father David, that is coming in the name of the Lord: hosanna in the highest.
041	MAR	011	011	And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and looking round about upon all things, it being now even-tide, he departed to Bethany with the twelve.
041	MAR	011	012	And on the morrow, as they were coming out of Bethany, he was hungry:
041	MAR	011	013	and seeing a fig-tree at a distance, full of leaves, he went to it, expecting probably that he might find some fruit upon it: and when he came to it, he found none, only leaves: for it was not a good season for figs.
041	MAR	011	014	And Jesus spake and said to it, Let no man eat fruit from thee henceforth for ever. And his disciples heard him.
041	MAR	011	015	And they came to Jerusalem and Jesus entered into the temple, and began to cast out those who sold and bought in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of those who sold doves;
041	MAR	011	016	and would not suffer that any person should carry a vessel through the temple.
041	MAR	011	017	And he taught them, saying, Is it not written, that “My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations?” but ye have made it a den of thieves.
041	MAR	011	018	And the scribes and chief priests heard him, and sought how they might destroy him: for they were afraid of him, because all the people were exceedingly struck with his teaching,
041	MAR	011	019	And when the evening came, he went away out of the city.
041	MAR	011	020	And in the morning, as they were passing by, they saw the fig-tree withered from the roots.
041	MAR	011	021	And Peter reminding him said, Rabbi, behold, the fig-tree which thou cursedst is withered away.
041	MAR	011	022	And Jesus answering said to them, Have faith in God.
041	MAR	011	023	For verily I say to you, That whosoever shall say to this mountain, Be thou lifted up, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall harbour no doubt in his heart, but believe that what he saith shall come to pass; whatsoever he may speak shall be done for him.
041	MAR	011	024	Therefore I say unto you, That all things whatever ye ask in prayer, believe that ye shall receive them, and they shall be given you.
041	MAR	011	025	And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have a matter against any man: that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.
041	MAR	011	026	But if ye forgive not, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.
041	MAR	011	027	And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders, come to him,
041	MAR	011	028	and say to him, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority, that thou shouldest do these things?
041	MAR	011	029	Then Jesus answering said unto them, I also will ask you one question; and answer me; and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
041	MAR	011	030	The baptism of John, was it of heaven, or of men? answer me.
041	MAR	011	031	And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we reply, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?
041	MAR	011	032	but if we say of men―they feared the people: for all men held John to be in truth a prophet.
041	MAR	011	033	And they answering said to Jesus, We do not know. And Jesus in reply said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.
041	MAR	012	001	AND he began to speak to them in parables. A man planted a vineyard, and set a hedge around it, and digged a wine-press, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went abroad.
041	MAR	012	002	And in the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.
041	MAR	012	003	But they took him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.
041	MAR	012	004	And again he sent unto them another servant; and they cut the account short with him, by stoning him, and sent him away shamefully treated.
041	MAR	012	005	And again he sent another; and him, they slew; and many others, some of whom they beat, and others they killed.
041	MAR	012	006	Now he had yet one son, his beloved, and he sent him unto them last, saying, They will reverence my son.
041	MAR	012	007	But these husbandmen said to each other, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be our own.
041	MAR	012	008	And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.
041	MAR	012	009	What then will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy these husbandmen, and give his vineyard to others.
041	MAR	012	010	Have ye never read this scripture? “The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner:
041	MAR	012	011	this was the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes.”
041	MAR	012	012	And they sought to seize him, and were afraid of the people: for they knew that he had spoken this parable against them: and leaving him, they departed.
041	MAR	012	013	And they sent unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, that they might entrap him in discourse.
041	MAR	012	014	And they come and say to him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest not for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to pay tribute to Caesar, or not?
041	MAR	012	015	shall we pay, or shall we not pay it? but he, perceiving their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a denarius, that I may see it.
041	MAR	012	016	And they brought it. And he said unto them, Whose figure and inscription is this? they say unto him, Caesar’s.
041	MAR	012	017	And Jesus addressing them, said, Render the things which are Caesar’s, to Caesar; and what belongs to God, to God. And they marvelled at him.
041	MAR	012	018	And the Sadducees come to him, who say that there is no resurrection; and they put a question to him, saying,
041	MAR	012	019	Master, Moses left it in writing for us, that if a man’s brother die, and leave a wife, and leave no children; that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed for his brother.
041	MAR	012	020	Now there were seven brothers; and the first took a wife, and dying left no issue:
041	MAR	012	021	and the second took her, and died, and neither did he leave issue; and the third in like manner.
041	MAR	012	022	And the seven had her, and left no issue. Last of all died also the wife.
041	MAR	012	023	In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife of them shall she be? for the seven had the very same wife.
041	MAR	012	024	And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, from not knowing the scriptures, and the power of God?
041	MAR	012	025	For when they rise from the dead, they will neither marry, nor be given in marriage; but they are as the angels which are in heaven.
041	MAR	012	026	But concerning the dead, that they do rise; have ye not read in the book of Moses, how God spake to him at the bush, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?
041	MAR	012	027	He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living. Ye are therefore vastly erroneous.
041	MAR	012	028	And one of the scribes coming, and hearing them questioning him, perceiving that he had answered them admirably, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?
041	MAR	012	029	Then Jesus replied to him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear O Israel; the Lord thy God is one Lord:
041	MAR	012	030	and thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength. This is the first commandment.
041	MAR	012	031	And the second, like it, is this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: there is no greater commandment than these.
041	MAR	012	032	And the scribe said unto him, Admirably, Master! thou hast spoken the very truth: for there is one God; and there is no other besides him:
041	MAR	012	033	and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength; and to love his neighbour as himself, is better than all burnt offerings, and sacrifices.
041	MAR	012	034	And Jesus perceiving that he had answered as a man of intelligence, said to him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man thenceforth presumed to question him.
041	MAR	012	035	And Jesus addressing them said, as he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that the Messiah is the Son of David?
041	MAR	012	036	for David himself saith by the Spirit, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thy enemies the foot-stool for thy feet.
041	MAR	012	037	David himself therefore calleth him Lord; and whence then is he his son? And a vast multitude heard him with delight.
041	MAR	012	038	And he spake to them in the course of his teaching, Beware of the scribes, who love to go about in trailing robes, and like salutations in the places of concourse,
041	MAR	012	039	and the principal seats in the synagogues, and the first couch at suppers:
041	MAR	012	040	who devour widows’ houses, and in pretence make long prayers: such shall receive greater damnation.
041	MAR	012	041	And as Jesus was sitting opposite the treasury, he saw a multitude casting money into the treasury: and many who were rich cast in many pieces.
041	MAR	012	042	And one poor widow coming, cast in two mites, which is a farthing.
041	MAR	012	043	And having called his disciples, he said unto them, I tell you truly, that this poor widow hath cast in more than all who have cast into the treasury:
041	MAR	012	044	for all they have cast in of their superfluities; but she from her indigence hath cast in all that she had, even her whole substance.
041	MAR	013	001	AND as he was going out of the temple, one of his disciples said unto him, Master, behold what vast stones, and what structures!
041	MAR	013	002	And Jesus answering said to him, Beholdest thou these magnificent structures? there shall not be left one stone upon another which shall not be thrown down.
041	MAR	013	003	And as he was sitting on the mount of Olives, opposite the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,
041	MAR	013	004	Tell us, when shall these things be? and what is the sign when all these things shall come to pass?
041	MAR	013	005	Then Jesus answering them, began to say, Beware that no man deceive you:
041	MAR	013	006	for many will come in my name, saying, I am the Messiah; and shall deceive many.
041	MAR	013	007	But when ye hear of wars, and rumours of wars, be not troubled: for these things must be; but the end is not yet.
041	MAR	013	008	And nation shall rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and commotions: these are the beginnings of sorrows.
041	MAR	013	009	But take ye heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to their sanhedrims, and to the synagogues; ye shall be beaten with rods, and be set before kings and governors for my name’s sake, for a testimony unto them.
041	MAR	013	010	And the Gospel must first be preached to all nations.
041	MAR	013	011	But when delivering you up, they shall bring you to the bar, be not previously anxious what ye shall say, neither premeditate: for it shall be given to you at that very hour, what ye shall speak: for it is not you, who are speaking, but the Holy Ghost.
041	MAR	013	012	And brother shall deliver up brother unto death, and the father the son: and children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death.
041	MAR	013	013	And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake. But he that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.
041	MAR	013	014	But when ye see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing where it ought not (let him that readeth observe), then let those who are in Judea fly to the mountains:
041	MAR	013	015	and let not him who is on the roof go down into the house, nor enter into it, to carry away any thing out of the house:
041	MAR	013	016	and he that is in the field, let him not return back to take his garment.
041	MAR	013	017	But wo to those who are big with child, and who have infants at their breasts in those days!
041	MAR	013	018	And pray that your flight be not in winter.
041	MAR	013	019	For these days shall bring tribulation, such as the like hath never been from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, and never shall be more.
041	MAR	013	020	And except the Lord had shortened the days, no flesh would have been preserved: but for the sake of those elect, whom he hath elected, he hath shortened the days.
041	MAR	013	021	And then, if any man say to you, Lo, here is the Messiah! or, lo there! believe it not.
041	MAR	013	022	For many false Messiahs and false prophets shall arise, and shall propose signs and wonders to deceive, if it were possible, even the elect.
041	MAR	013	023	But be ye on your guard: lo! I have told you all things:
041	MAR	013	024	but in those days, after that distressing season, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not emit her light;
041	MAR	013	025	and the stars of the heaven will be falling, and the powers that are in heaven will be shaken.
041	MAR	013	026	And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with vast power and glory.
041	MAR	013	027	And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather to him his elect from the four winds, from the extremity of the earth to the utmost bound of heaven.
041	MAR	013	028	Now learn from the fig-tree, a parable; When her branch is now become tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh;
041	MAR	013	029	so also you, when ye see these things come to pass, know that it is nigh, even at the doors.
041	MAR	013	030	Verily I say unto you, That this generation shall not pass away, until all these things are fulfilled.
041	MAR	013	031	Heaven and earth shall pass away; but my words shall never pass away.
041	MAR	013	032	But of that day and hour knoweth no man, nor the angels which are in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father.
041	MAR	013	033	Take ye heed, watch, and pray; for ye know not when the time is.
041	MAR	013	034	As a man going abroad, when he left his abode, and gave his servants authority, and to each his work, commanded also the porter to watch.
041	MAR	013	035	Watch ye therefore; for ye know not at what time the master of the house cometh, at evening, or midnight, or cock-crowing, or in the morning:
041	MAR	013	036	lest coming suddenly he find you asleep.
041	MAR	013	037	Now what I say to you, I say to all, Watch.
041	MAR	014	001	NOW the passover and the feast of unleavened bread were but two days distant; and the chief priests, and the scribes, sought how they might seize him by craft, and kill him.
041	MAR	014	002	But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be a commotion among the people.
041	MAR	014	003	And when he was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at table, a woman came, having an alabaster vase of ointment, of genuine spikenard, of vast value: and breaking the vase, she let it flow down upon his head.
041	MAR	014	004	And there were some who felt indignation within themselves, saying, Wherefore is this waste of the ointment made?
041	MAR	014	005	For it might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii, and given to the poor. And they bitterly murmured against her.
041	MAR	014	006	Then said Jesus, Let her alone; why give ye her uneasiness? she hath performed a laudable act towards me.
041	MAR	014	007	For the poor ye have always with you, and when ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.
041	MAR	014	008	What was in her power she hath done; she has seized the opportunity to anoint my body beforehand for burial.
041	MAR	014	009	Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached through the whole world, there shall, what she hath done, be told for a memorial of her.
041	MAR	014	010	Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, that he might betray him unto them.
041	MAR	014	011	When they heard it, they rejoiced, and promised to give him a sum in silver. And he watched how opportunely he might deliver him up.
041	MAR	014	012	And on the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare for thee to eat the passover?
041	MAR	014	013	And he sent two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go into the city, and a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water, follow him.
041	MAR	014	014	And where he enters, say to the master of the family. That the teacher saith, Where is the dining-room, where I may eat the passover with my disciples?
041	MAR	014	015	And he will shew you a large upper room ready furnished: there make preparation for us.
041	MAR	014	016	And his disciples went out, and came into the city, and found as he had spoken to them; and they made ready the passover.
041	MAR	014	017	And when it was evening he came with the twelve.
041	MAR	014	018	And as they sat at table, and were eating, Jesus said, Verily I tell you, That one of you, who is eating with me, shall betray me.
041	MAR	014	019	And they began to be very sorry, and to say to him, one by one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I?
041	MAR	014	020	But he answering said to them, It is one of the twelve, who is dipping his hand with me into the dish.
041	MAR	014	021	The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him; but wo to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been desirable for that man if he had never been born.
041	MAR	014	022	And as they were eating, Jesus taking a loaf, when he had blessed, brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.
041	MAR	014	023	And taking the cup, when he had given thanks, he gave it to them; and they all drank out of it.
041	MAR	014	024	And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.
041	MAR	014	025	Verily I say unto you, That I will henceforth no more drink of the produce of the vine, until that day when I shall drink it new in the kingdom of God.
041	MAR	014	026	And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives.
041	MAR	014	027	And Jesus saith to them, All ye will be offended at me this night; for it is written, “I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be dispersed:”
041	MAR	014	028	but after I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.
041	MAR	014	029	Then said Peter unto him, Though all should be offended, yet will not I.
041	MAR	014	030	And Jesus saith to him, Verily I tell thee, That to-day, in the course of this very night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt thrice deny me.
041	MAR	014	031	But he said with more vehement assertion, Though I should die with thee, yet would I in no wise deny thee. And they all spake also in the same manner.
041	MAR	014	032	And they come to a place called Gethsemane, and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here whilst I shall pray.
041	MAR	014	033	And he taketh Peter, and James, and John, with him; and he began to be filled with horrible dread, and to be sunk under dejection of spirit:
041	MAR	014	034	and he saith to them, My soul is deeply afflicted even to death: abide here, and watch.
041	MAR	014	035	And he went a little farther forward, and fell on the earth, and prayed, that if it were possible the hour might pass from him.
041	MAR	014	036	And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee; remove this cup from me, nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.
041	MAR	014	037	And he came and found them asleep: and saith unto Peter, Sleepest thou? hast thou not strength to watch with me a single hour?
041	MAR	014	038	Watch ye and pray, that ye enter not into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
041	MAR	014	039	And again he went away, and prayed, speaking the same sentence.
041	MAR	014	040	And when he returned, he found them again sleeping; for their eyes were weighed down: and they knew not what to answer him.
041	MAR	014	041	Then the third time he cometh, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and repose: it is enough, the hour is come; lo! the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners;
041	MAR	014	042	arise, let us go; behold, the traitor approaches me.
041	MAR	014	043	And immediately, while he was yet speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, came up, and a great multitude with him, with swords and staves, from the chief priests, and scribes, and elders.
041	MAR	014	044	Now he that betrayed him, had given them a countersign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he, seize him, and lead him off safely.
041	MAR	014	045	And coming, he immediately drew up to him and said, Rabbi, Rabbi, and kissed him.
041	MAR	014	046	Then they laid their hands on him, and seized him.
041	MAR	014	047	And one particular person of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
041	MAR	014	048	And Jesus addressing them said, Are ye come out as against a robber, with swords and staves, to apprehend me?
041	MAR	014	049	Daily was I with you in the temple teaching, and ye laid no hold upon me: but this is done that the scriptures might be fulfilled.
041	MAR	014	050	Then they all deserting him, fled.
041	MAR	014	051	And a certain youth followed him, having a linen cloth wrapped round his naked body; and the young men laid hold of him;
041	MAR	014	052	and leaving the linen cloth behind, he fled naked from them.
041	MAR	014	053	And they led Jesus unto the high-priest; and with him were assembled all the chief priests, and the elders, and the scribes.
041	MAR	014	054	And Peter followed him at a distance, until he came into the palace of the high-priest: and was seated with the servants, and warming himself at the fire.
041	MAR	014	055	Then the chief priests, and the whole sanhedrim, sought for witness against Jesus, that they might put him to death; yet found none.
041	MAR	014	056	For many bore false witness against him, and their attestations did not correspond.
041	MAR	014	057	And certain persons rising up, bore false witness against him, saying,
041	MAR	014	058	We have heard him affirm, I will destroy this temple made with hands, and after three days I will build another not made with hands.
041	MAR	014	059	But even then their testimony was not correspondent.
041	MAR	014	060	So the high-priest rising up in the midst interrogated Jesus, Answerest thou nothing? What is it that these witness against thee?
041	MAR	014	061	But he kept silence, and made them not a word of reply. Again the high-priest questioned him, and said to him, Art thou the Messiah, the Son of the blessed?
041	MAR	014	062	Then said Jesus, I am. And ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.
041	MAR	014	063	Then the high-priest rent his clothes, and said, What farther need have we of witnesses?
041	MAR	014	064	Ye have heard his blasphemy. What think ye? And they all adjudged him to be deserving of death.
041	MAR	014	065	And some began to spit upon him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say to him, Prophesy: and the servants slapped him on the face with their hands.
041	MAR	014	066	And as Peter was in the hall, at the lower end, there came to him one of the high-priest’s maid-servants:
041	MAR	014	067	and seeing Peter warming himself, stedfastly looking at him, she said, Thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.
041	MAR	014	068	Then he denied it, saying, I do not so much as know him, nor understand what thou art saying. And he went out into the vestibule; and the cock crew.
041	MAR	014	069	And a maid-servant observing him again; began to say to those who stood by, This man is one of them.
041	MAR	014	070	Then he denied it again. And after a little while, they who stood by said to Peter, Of a certainty thou art one of them; for thou art a Galilean, and thy speech is correspondent.
041	MAR	014	071	Then began he to make the most dreadful imprecations, and to swear, I know not the man of whom ye speak.
041	MAR	014	072	And the second time the cock crew. And Peter remembered the word which Jesus spake unto him, That before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And casting his mantle over his face, he wept.
041	MAR	015	001	AND immediately the chief priests having held a council in the morning, with the elders, and scribes, and the whole sanhedrim, after binding Jesus, led him away, and delivered him up to Pilate.
041	MAR	015	002	And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? He answering said to him, Thou sayest true.
041	MAR	015	003	And the chief priests laid many accusations against him.
041	MAR	015	004	Then Pilate again interrogated him, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they testify against thee.
041	MAR	015	005	But Jesus notwithstanding made not a word of reply; so that Pilate marvelled.
041	MAR	015	006	Now at the feast, he released one prisoner to them, whomsoever they petitioned for.
041	MAR	015	007	And there was one called Barabbas, bound with those who had made an insurrection with him, and had committed murder in the insurrection.
041	MAR	015	008	And the multitude, clamorous, began to petition him to do, as he had always done to them.
041	MAR	015	009	Then Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the king of the Jews?
041	MAR	015	010	(For he knew that out of envy the chief priests had delivered him up.)
041	MAR	015	011	Then the chief priests stirred up the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.
041	MAR	015	012	Then Pilate addressing them, said unto them again, What therefore do you wish that I should do with him whom ye call the king of the Jews?
041	MAR	015	013	And they cried out again, Crucify him.
041	MAR	015	014	Then Pilate said unto them, But what criminal act hath he done? And they cried the more vociferously, Crucify him.
041	MAR	015	015	So Pilate, willing to do what would be satisfactory to the people, released to them Barabbas, and delivered Jesus to be scourged, in order to be crucified.
041	MAR	015	016	Then the soldiers led him to the hall, which is the Praetorium, and called together the whole band.
041	MAR	015	017	And they invested him with a robe of purple, and platting a crown of thorns, put it about his head,
041	MAR	015	018	and began to pay their salutations to him, Hail, King of the Jews!
041	MAR	015	019	And they struck him on the head with a cane, and spat upon him, and bowing their knees payed him homage.
041	MAR	015	020	And when they had treated him with mockery, they took off the purple robe from him, and clothed him with his own garments, and led him out to crucify him.
041	MAR	015	021	And they compel one Simon, a Cyrenian, who was passing by, coming out of the field, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry his cross.
041	MAR	015	022	And they convey him to a place called Golgotha, which is being interpreted, The place of a skull.
041	MAR	015	023	And they gave him to drink wine medicated with myrrh: but he received it not.
041	MAR	015	024	And having crucified him, they divided his garments, casting the lot upon them, what each should take.
041	MAR	015	025	Now it was the third hour, and they crucified him.
041	MAR	015	026	And there was an inscription of his crime written over him, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
041	MAR	015	027	And with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right hand, and the other on his left.
041	MAR	015	028	And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, “And he was reckoned among the transgressors.”
041	MAR	015	029	And they who passed along, blasphemed him, shaking their heads, and saying, Aha! thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,
041	MAR	015	030	save thyself, and come down from the cross.
041	MAR	015	031	And in the same manner also, the chief priests mocking him, among each other, with the scribes, said, He saved others, himself he cannot save.
041	MAR	015	032	Thou Messiah, King of Israel, come now down from the cross, that we may see, and believe. Even those who were crucified with him railed on him.
041	MAR	015	033	Now when the sixth hour came, there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.
041	MAR	015	034	And at the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabacthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, for what cause hast thou abandoned me?
041	MAR	015	035	And some of those who stood by, hearing him, said, Behold, he crieth for Elias.
041	MAR	015	036	Then one ran, and filling a sponge with vinegar, fixed it round a cane, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone, let us see if Elias comes to take him down.
041	MAR	015	037	Then Jesus, uttering a loud cry, gave up the ghost.
041	MAR	015	038	And the vail of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom.
041	MAR	015	039	And the centurion, who stood opposite to him, observing, that with such a cry he gave up the ghost, said, Assuredly this was the Son of God.
041	MAR	015	040	Now there were also women looking on at a distance; among whom also was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the small, and the mother of Joses, and Salome.
041	MAR	015	041	These women followed him when he was in Galilee, and supplied his wants; and many other women who went up with him to Jerusalem.
041	MAR	015	042	And when the evening was now come (since it was the preparation, that is the day preceding the sabbath),
041	MAR	015	043	Joseph, who was from Arimathea, came, a respectable person, a counsellor, and who himself also was expecting the kingdom of God; taking courage, he went in to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.
041	MAR	015	044	Then Pilate marvelled that he should be already dead: and calling for the centurion, he asked him, If he had been dead any time.
041	MAR	015	045	And when he knew it from the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.
041	MAR	015	046	And having bought a wrapper of fine linen, and taken him down, he wrapped him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a sepulchre, which was hewn out of a rock; and rolled a stone to the door of the sepulchre.
041	MAR	015	047	Now Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of Joses, saw where he was laid.
041	MAR	016	001	AND when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, purchased aromatics, that they might come, and anoint him.
041	MAR	016	002	And very early on the first day of the week, they come to the sepulchre, as the sun was rising.
041	MAR	016	003	And said among themselves, Who will roll away for us the stone from the door of the sepulchre?
041	MAR	016	004	And looking again, they saw that the stone was rolled away, for it was vastly large.
041	MAR	016	005	And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting at the right hand, clothed in a white robe; and they were greatly terrified.
041	MAR	016	006	But he saith unto them, Be not affrighted, ye seek Jesus the Nazarean, who was crucified; he is risen, he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.
041	MAR	016	007	But go, tell his disciples, and Peter, that he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him, as he told you.
041	MAR	016	008	And they going out hastily, fled from the sepulchre, for trembling and astonishment had seized them: and they said not a word to any person, for they were affrighted.
041	MAR	016	009	(note: The most reliable and earliest manuscripts do not include Mark 16:9-20.) Now being arisen early, on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.
041	MAR	016	010	She going, told it to those who had been with him, as they were wailing and weeping.
041	MAR	016	011	And they, when they heard that he was alive, and had been seen by her, gave no credit to her.
041	MAR	016	012	Then after this, he was manifested under another form, to two of them as they were walking, and going into the country.
041	MAR	016	013	And they came back and told the news to the rest; neither did they believe them.
041	MAR	016	014	Afterwards he shewed himself to the eleven, as they were sitting at table, and upbraided them for their infidelity and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen him after he was risen.
041	MAR	016	015	And he said unto them, Go into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.
041	MAR	016	016	He that believeth and is baptised shall be saved; and he that believeth not shall be damned.
041	MAR	016	017	And these signs shall follow those that believe: in my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;
041	MAR	016	018	they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly potion, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover health.
041	MAR	016	019	Then the Lord, after having thus spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.
041	MAR	016	020	But they going forth preached every where, the Lord working mightily with them, and confirming the word, by attendant miracles.

# BOOK	042	LUK	Luke	Luke
042	LUK	001	001	SINCE many have attempted to compose a narrative of facts, confirmed to us by the fullest evidence:
042	LUK	001	002	exactly as they delivered them to us, who were eve witnesses from the first, and ministers of the word;
042	LUK	001	003	it seemed right to me also, having obtained accurate knowledge of all things from above, to write to thee in regular order, most excellent Theophilus,
042	LUK	001	004	to the intent that thou mayest clearly know the certainty of those matters, concerning which thou hast been instructed.
042	LUK	001	005	There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abiah: and his wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name Elisabeth.
042	LUK	001	006	And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.
042	LUK	001	007	And they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and both were far advanced in years.
042	LUK	001	008	And it came to pass, as he discharged his priestly office in the order of his periodical ministration before God,
042	LUK	001	009	according to the custom of the priesthood, it fell to his lot to burn the incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.
042	LUK	001	010	And all the multitude of people was praying without, at the time of the burning the incense.
042	LUK	001	011	And an angel of the Lord appeared to him standing on the right side of the altar of incense.
042	LUK	001	012	And Zacharias was agitated greatly at the sight, and fear fell upon him.
042	LUK	001	013	But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bring thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.
042	LUK	001	014	And it shall give thee joy and exultation; and many shall rejoice at his birth:
042	LUK	001	015	for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord; and he shall never drink wine, nor any intoxicating liquor; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother’s womb.
042	LUK	001	016	And many of the children of Israel shall he turn unto the Lord, their God.
042	LUK	001	017	And he shall go forth before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to convert the hearts of fathers with their children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to prepare a people ready for the Lord.
042	LUK	001	018	And Zacharias said to the angel, By what shall I know this? for I am old, and my wife far advanced in her age.
042	LUK	001	019	And the angel answering said to him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and I have been sent to speak to thee, and to proclaim these glad tidings to thee.
042	LUK	001	020	And behold, thou shalt be dumb, and unable to speak, until that day when these things shall come to pass, because thou hast not believed my words, which shall be fulfilled at their exact time.
042	LUK	001	021	And the people were waiting for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.
042	LUK	001	022	And when he came out, he could not speak to them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he himself made signs to them, and continued deaf and dumb.
042	LUK	001	023	And it came to pass, when the days of his ministry were fulfilled, he went to his own house.
042	LUK	001	024	And after those days Elisabeth his wife conceived, and kept herself in retirement five months, saying,
042	LUK	001	025	Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days in which he looked upon me to take away my reproach among men.
042	LUK	001	026	Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee, the name of which was Nazareth,
042	LUK	001	027	to a virgin of the house of David, betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph; and the virgin’s name was Mary.
042	LUK	001	028	And the angel coming in to her said, All hail! O thou highly favoured one! the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.
042	LUK	001	029	And when she saw him, she was greatly agitated at his address: and reasoned in herself what kind of salutation this could be.
042	LUK	001	030	And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found favour with God.
042	LUK	001	031	And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS.
042	LUK	001	032	He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God will give him the throne of David his father;
042	LUK	001	033	and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever, and of his kingdom there shall be no end.
042	LUK	001	034	And Mary said, How shall this be, seeing I know not man?
042	LUK	001	035	And the angel answering said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee; wherefore also the Holy One that shall be born of thee, shall be called the Son of God.
042	LUK	001	036	And, behold, Elisabeth thy cousin, she also hath conceived in her old age: and this is the fifth month of pregnancy with her who was called barren.
042	LUK	001	037	For there is nothing impossible with God.
042	LUK	001	038	Then said Mary, Behold a servant of the Lord, be it to me according to thy declaration. And the angel departed from her.
042	LUK	001	039	Then Mary arose in those days, and went with haste into the hill country, to a city of Judah,
042	LUK	001	040	and entered into the house of Zachariah, and saluted Elisabeth.
042	LUK	001	041	And it came to pass, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped for joy in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:
042	LUK	001	042	and she exclaimed with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.
042	LUK	001	043	And whence is this favour shewn me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
042	LUK	001	044	For, lo! as the voice of thy salutation reached my ears, the babe leaped for joy in my womb.
042	LUK	001	045	And blessed is she that hath believed; for there shall be a fulfilment of the things told her from the Lord.
042	LUK	001	046	And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,
042	LUK	001	047	and my spirit hath exulted in God my Saviour:
042	LUK	001	048	for he hath looked upon the lowly state of his maid-servant: for, lo! henceforth shall all generations pronounce me blessed.
042	LUK	001	049	For the Mighty One hath done great things for me; and holy is his name.
042	LUK	001	050	And his mercy is upon those who fear him, from generation to generation.
042	LUK	001	051	He hath displayed strength from his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.
042	LUK	001	052	He hath cast down potentates from the throne, and hath exalted the lowly.
042	LUK	001	053	He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.
042	LUK	001	054	He hath succoured Israel his servant, that he might be mindful of mercy for ever;
042	LUK	001	055	as he had spoken to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed.
042	LUK	001	056	And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned unto her home.
042	LUK	001	057	Now Elisabeth’s time was up that she should be delivered; and she brought a son.
042	LUK	001	058	And her neighbours and her relations heard, that the Lord had magnified his mercy upon her; and they congratulated her.
042	LUK	001	059	And it came to pass, on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him after the name of his father, Zacharias.
042	LUK	001	060	And his mother spake and said, No; but he shall be called John.
042	LUK	001	061	And they said to her, There is not one among thy relations, who is called by this name.
042	LUK	001	062	And they made signs to his father, what he would have him called.
042	LUK	001	063	And desiring a writing tablet, he wrote, saying, John is his name. And they were all surprised.
042	LUK	001	064	Instantly then his mouth was opened, and his tongue loosed, and he burst out in praises to God.
042	LUK	001	065	And great awe fell on all those who dwelt around them: and in all the mountainous country of Judea, all these circumstances were the subject of conversation.
042	LUK	001	066	And all who heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, Well! what a child will this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.
042	LUK	001	067	And Zacharias his father was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying,
042	LUK	001	068	Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel; for he hath visited and wrought redemption for his people;
042	LUK	001	069	and hath raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David:
042	LUK	001	070	as he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been from the beginning:
042	LUK	001	071	even preservation from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;
042	LUK	001	072	to perform mercy towards our fathers, and to remember his own holy covenant:
042	LUK	001	073	the oath which he sware to Abraham our father,
042	LUK	001	074	to give us, that we, secure from fear, rescued from the hands of our enemies, should serve him,
042	LUK	001	075	in righteousness and holiness before him, all the days of our life.
042	LUK	001	076	And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Most High; for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;
042	LUK	001	077	to give the knowledge of salvation to his people, by the remission of their sins,
042	LUK	001	078	through the bowels of mercy of our God; with which he hath visited us, as the dawn of the morning from on high,
042	LUK	001	079	to illumine those who sat in darkness, and in the shadow of death, to direct our feet into the way of peace.
042	LUK	001	080	And the child grew, and became mighty in spirit, and was in the deserts until the days of his public exhibition to Israel.
042	LUK	002	001	NOW it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that the whole land should be registered.
042	LUK	002	002	(And this first enrolment was made by Cyrenius, afterwards governor of Syria)
042	LUK	002	003	And all went to be registered, every one to his own city.
042	LUK	002	004	Then Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; because he was of the house and family of David;
042	LUK	002	005	to be enregistered with Mary, the wife espoused to him, who was big with child.
042	LUK	002	006	And it came to pass, while they were there, that her time was up, that she should be delivered.
042	LUK	002	007	And she brought forth a son, her first-born, and wrapped him in swaddling-clothes, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.
042	LUK	002	008	And there were shepherds in that country abiding in the open air, and keeping guard over their flock by night.
042	LUK	002	009	And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them; and they were exceedingly affrighted.
042	LUK	002	010	And the angel said unto them, Be not affrighted: for, behold, I bring you tidings of great joy, which shall be for all the people.
042	LUK	002	011	Because this day there is born for you a Saviour, which is Messiah, the Lord, in the city of David.
042	LUK	002	012	And this shall be a sign for you; Ye shall find the babe in swaddling-clothes, lying in a manger.
042	LUK	002	013	And suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God, and saying,
042	LUK	002	014	Glory in the highest heavens to God! and upon earth, peace! towards men complacence.
042	LUK	002	015	And it came to pass, as the angels went from them into heaven, the men, the shepherds, said also to each other, Let us now go to Bethlehem, and see this thing which hath happened, which the Lord hath made known to us.
042	LUK	002	016	And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe, lying in the manger:
042	LUK	002	017	and when they saw it, they made a public report of the declaration delivered to them respecting this child.
042	LUK	002	018	And all who heard it, marvelled at the things told them by the shepherds.
042	LUK	002	019	But Mary carefully preserved all these declarations, laying them together in her heart, in order to apprehend their meaning.
042	LUK	002	020	And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things which they had heard and seen, exactly as had been told them.
042	LUK	002	021	And when eight days were fulfilled for circumcising the child, his name also was called JESUS, the name imposed by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.
042	LUK	002	022	And when the days of her purification were accomplished according to the law of Moses, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord;
042	LUK	002	023	as it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male child, that openeth the womb, shall be called holy to the Lord;
042	LUK	002	024	and to offer a sacrifice, according to what is prescribed in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtle doves, or two young pigeons.
042	LUK	002	025	And, behold, there was a man at Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and this man was righteous and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him.
042	LUK	002	026	And it had been divinely communicated to him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death, till he had seen the Lord’s Messiah.
042	LUK	002	027	And he came by the spirit into the temple; just as the parents were bringing in the child Jesus, that they might do according to what was the custom of the law concerning him;
042	LUK	002	028	and he took him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,
042	LUK	002	029	Now dismiss thy servant, Lord, according to thy word, in peace;
042	LUK	002	030	for my eyes have seen thy salvation,
042	LUK	002	031	which thou hast prepared before the face of all people.
042	LUK	002	032	A light to give revelation to the Gentiles, and glory to thy people Israel.
042	LUK	002	033	And Joseph and his mother were amazed at the things spoken concerning him.
042	LUK	002	034	And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, Behold, this child is appointed for the fall, and rising again of many in Israel; and for a marked object to be spoken against;
042	LUK	002	035	(so shall a dart pierce through thy own soul) that the reasonings of many hearts may be laid open,
042	LUK	002	036	And there was Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asser: she was far advanced in old age, having lived but seven years with a husband, from her virgin state:
042	LUK	002	037	though she was now a widow, of about eighty-four years, who departed not from the temple, attending the divine service, with fastings and prayers night and day:
042	LUK	002	038	and at the very same moment coming up, she also in turn confessed the Lord, and spake of him to all who were expecting redemption in Jerusalem.
042	LUK	002	039	And when they had finished all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, into their own city Nazareth.
042	LUK	002	040	And the child grew, and became endued with great powers of spirit, filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon him.
042	LUK	002	041	And his parents went annually to Jerusalem at the feast of the passover.
042	LUK	002	042	And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem, according to the custom of the feast.
042	LUK	002	043	And when they had concluded the days, as they were returning, the child Jesus remained at Jerusalem, and Joseph and his mother knew it not:
042	LUK	002	044	but supposing him to be in the company, they went a day’s journey; and they sought him among their relations and acquaintances;
042	LUK	002	045	and not finding him, they returned to Jerusalem in search of him.
042	LUK	002	046	And it came to pass after three days, they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them and asking them questions.
042	LUK	002	047	And all who heard him, were in a transport of admiration, at his understanding and answers.
042	LUK	002	048	And when they saw him, they were struck with surprise; and his mother said to him, Son, why hast thou behaved to us in this manner? lo! thy father and I have been seeking thee in anguish of heart.
042	LUK	002	049	And he said unto them, Wherefore did ye seek me? did you not know, that I must be occupied with my Father’s affairs?
042	LUK	002	050	And they understood not the meaning of what he spake to them.
042	LUK	002	051	And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was in subjection to them: though his mother preserved all these sayings in her heart.
042	LUK	002	052	And Jesus advanced in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and men.
042	LUK	003	001	NOW in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod tetrarch of Galilee, and Philip his brother tetrarch of Iturea and the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene:
042	LUK	003	002	when Annas and Caiaphas were high-priests, the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness;
042	LUK	003	003	and he came into all the country on the confines of Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;
042	LUK	003	004	as it is written in the book of the words of the prophet Isaiah, saying, “The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths strait:
042	LUK	003	005	every valley shall be filled up, and every mountain and hill shall be levelled, and the crooked ways made strait, and the rough roads smooth:
042	LUK	003	006	and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.”
042	LUK	003	007	He said, therefore, to the multitudes who came out to be baptised by him, Ye broods of vipers, who hath warned you to fly from the approaching wrath?
042	LUK	003	008	Produce then fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say in yourselves, We have a father, even Abraham; for I say unto you, That God is able out of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.
042	LUK	003	009	But now is the ax laid even to the root of the trees; every tree therefore that produceth not good fruit, is cut down and cast into the fire.
042	LUK	003	010	And the multitudes asked him, saying, What then shall we do?
042	LUK	003	011	And he answering said to them, He that hath two coats, let him give to him that hath none; and he that hath provisions, let him do in like manner.
042	LUK	003	012	Then came also the farmers of the taxes to be baptised, and they said unto him, Master, what shall we do?
042	LUK	003	013	He said unto them, Exact nothing more than is appointed for you.
042	LUK	003	014	And the military men also asked him, And what shall we do? And he said unto them, Extort nothing by force; nor turn informers; and be content with your pay.
042	LUK	003	015	Now when the people were in expectation, and many reasoned in their hearts respecting John, whether he were the Messiah,
042	LUK	003	016	John addressed himself to them all, saying, I indeed baptise you with water; but one mightier than I is coming, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie: he shall baptise you with the Holy Ghost and with fire;
042	LUK	003	017	whose winnowing fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing-floor, and collect the wheat into his granary; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.
042	LUK	003	018	Thus in many and various discourses exhorting them, he preached the glad tidings of the gospel to the people.
042	LUK	003	019	Now Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him, on account of Herodias his brother Philip’s wife, and for all the other wicked actions which he had done,
042	LUK	003	020	added this also to all the rest, and shut up John in prison.
042	LUK	003	021	Now it came to pass, at the time when John was baptising all the people, that Jesus also was baptised, and as he prayed, the heaven was opened,
042	LUK	003	022	and the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily form, like a dove, upon him, and a voice came from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased.
042	LUK	003	023	And Jesus himself was about thirty years of age when he began his ministry, being (as was supposed the son of Joseph) of Heli,
042	LUK	003	024	of Matthat, of Levi, of Melchi, of Janna, of Joseph,
042	LUK	003	025	of Mattathias, of Amos, of Naum, of Esli, of Nagge,
042	LUK	003	026	of Maath, of Mattathias, of Semei, of Joseph, of Juda,
042	LUK	003	027	of Joanna, of Rhesa, of Zerubbabel, of Salathiel, of Neri,
042	LUK	003	028	of Melchi, of Addi, of Cosam, of Elmodam, of Er,
042	LUK	003	029	of Jose, of Eliezer, of Jorim, of Matthat, of Levi,
042	LUK	003	030	of Simeon, of Judah, of Joseph, of Jonan, of Eliakim,
042	LUK	003	031	of Melea, of Menan, of Mattatha, of Nathan, of David,
042	LUK	003	032	of Jesse, of Obed, of Booz, of Salmon, of Naasson,
042	LUK	003	033	of Aminadab, of Aram, of Esrom, of Phares, of Judah,
042	LUK	003	034	of Jacob, of Isaac, of Abraham, of Terah, of Nachor,
042	LUK	003	035	of Saruch, of Ragau, of Phalec, of Heber, of Sala,
042	LUK	003	036	of Cainan, of Arphaxad, of Sem, of Noe, of Lamech,
042	LUK	003	037	of Methusaleh, of Enoch, of Jared, of Maleleel, of Cainan,
042	LUK	003	038	of Enos, of Seth, of Adam, the son of God.
042	LUK	004	001	THEN Jesus full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by the spirit into the wilderness,
042	LUK	004	002	being tempted forty days by the devil; and did eat nothing during those days: and when they were ended, afterwards he was hungry.
042	LUK	004	003	And the devil said to him, If thou art the Son of God, command this stone that it become a loaf.
042	LUK	004	004	And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.”
042	LUK	004	005	And the devil taking him up into an exceeding high mountain, displayed before him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time:
042	LUK	004	006	and the devil said unto him, I will give thee all this authority, and the glory of these; for to me it is delivered, and to whomsoever I will, I give it.
042	LUK	004	007	If therefore thou wilt worship before me, all shall be thine.
042	LUK	004	008	And Jesus answering him, said, Get thee behind me, Satan, for it is written, “Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and to him alone shalt thou pay divine honour.”
042	LUK	004	009	And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a wing of the temple, and said to him, If thou art the Son of God, cast thy self down from hence:
042	LUK	004	010	for it is written, “He shall give his angels a charge over thee, to guard thee safely;
042	LUK	004	011	and that in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.”
042	LUK	004	012	And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, “Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.”
042	LUK	004	013	And when the devil had closed all the temptation, he departed from him for a season.
042	LUK	004	014	And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and a report went out into all the region round about concerning him.
042	LUK	004	015	And he taught in their synagogues, being universally admired.
042	LUK	004	016	And he came to Nazareth, where he was brought up; and he went, according to his usual custom, into the synagogue on the sabbath-day, and rose up to read.
042	LUK	004	017	And there was given to him the book of the prophet Isaiah: and unrolling the volume, he found the passage where it is written,
042	LUK	004	018	“The spirit of the Lord is upon me, for the work whereunto he hath anointed me; he hath sent me to preach glad tidings to the poor; to heal the contrite in heart; to proclaim liberty to the captives; and restore sight to the blind; to send forth the bruised free from bonds;
042	LUK	004	019	to publish the acceptable year of the Lord.”
042	LUK	004	020	And rolling up the volume, he gave it to the attendant officer, and sat down. And the eyes of all who were in the synagogue were attentively fixed on him.
042	LUK	004	021	And he began to say to them, To day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears.
042	LUK	004	022	And all concurred in their testimony to him, and marvelled at the gracious words which proceeded from his mouth. And they said, Is not this the son of Joseph?
042	LUK	004	023	And he said unto them, Ye will probably say to me this parable, Physician, heal thyself! the works which we have heard to have been performed by thee at Capernaum, do the like here in thy own country.
042	LUK	004	024	But he said, Verily, I say unto you, that no prophet is acceptable in his own country.
042	LUK	004	025	Now I tell you of a certainty, that there were many widows in the days of Elias, in Israel, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, so that a grievous famine was upon all the land.
042	LUK	004	026	And unto none of them was Elias sent, but unto Sarepta, a city of Sidon, to a widow woman.
042	LUK	004	027	And many lepers were in Israel in the days of the prophet Elisha, and no one of them was cleansed, but Naaman the Syrian.
042	LUK	004	028	And they were all filled with rage in the synagogue, when they heard these observations:
042	LUK	004	029	and rising up, dragged him out of the city, and led him to the brow of the hill, on which their city was built, in order to cast him down headlong:
042	LUK	004	030	but he passing through the midst of them, went away.
042	LUK	004	031	And he came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and was teaching them on the sabbath.
042	LUK	004	032	And they were struck with astonishment at his teaching; for his discourse was with authority.
042	LUK	004	033	And there was in the synagogue a man, who had a spirit of an unclean devil, and he roared out with a great cry,
042	LUK	004	034	saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, Jesus the Nazarean? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God.
042	LUK	004	035	And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Stop thy mouth, and come out of him. And the devil throwing him down into the midst, came out of him, doing him no injury.
042	LUK	004	036	And amazement seized on all present, and they spake one to another, saying, What a word is this? for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out.
042	LUK	004	037	And the fame of him went forth into all the adjacent region.
042	LUK	004	038	Then rising up out of the synagogue, he came into the house of Simon: and Simon’s mother-in-law was seized with a violent fever, and they besought him on her behalf.
042	LUK	004	039	And standing over her, he charged the fever to depart; and it left her: and immediately she arose, and waited upon them.
042	LUK	004	040	So when the sun was set, all who had any indisposed with various diseases, brought them to him; and laying his hands severally on each of them, he cured them.
042	LUK	004	041	And devils also went out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art the Messiah the Son of God. And rebuking them, he suffered them not to speak: for they knew that he was the Messiah.
042	LUK	004	042	And as the day was coming on, he went forth and departed into a desert place: and the multitude sought him out, and came to him, and would have detained him that he should not leave them.
042	LUK	004	043	But he said unto them, I must preach the glad tidings of the kingdom of heaven in other cities also: for on this service am I sent.
042	LUK	004	044	And he continued preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.
042	LUK	005	001	AND it came to pass, as the multitude were thronging upon him, in order to hear the word of God, that he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret:
042	LUK	005	002	and he saw two vessels a-ground near the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and washing their nets.
042	LUK	005	003	Then he went on board one of the vessels, which was Simon’s, and desired him to put off a little from the land: and sitting down, he taught the multitudes out of the vessel.
042	LUK	005	004	And when he ceased speaking, he said to Simon, Go off into deep water, and shoot your nets for a draught.
042	LUK	005	005	And Simon answering, said unto him, Sir, we have been toiling all night, and have taken nothing: but at thy command I will shoot the net.
042	LUK	005	006	And having done so, they inclosed a prodigious multitude of fishes; and their net was broken.
042	LUK	005	007	And they made signals to their partners in the other vessels, that they should come to their assistance. And they came, and filled both the vessels, so that they were ready to founder.
042	LUK	005	008	Then Simon Peter seeing it, fell down on his knees before Jesus, saying, Go from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord!
042	LUK	005	009	For amazement had seized on him, and on all who were with him, at the draught of fishes which they had taken:
042	LUK	005	010	as also on James and John the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Fear not: henceforward thou shalt catch men.
042	LUK	005	011	And when they had brought their vessels on shore, they left all, and followed him.
042	LUK	005	012	And it came to pass as he was just at one of the cities, behold, a man full of leprosy! and seeing Jesus, he fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
042	LUK	005	013	And he stretching out his hand touched him, saying, I will: be thou cleansed. And instantly the leprosy departed from him.
042	LUK	005	014	And he commanded him to tell no man: but go shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy purification, as Moses enjoined, for a testimony unto them.
042	LUK	005	015	Now the discourse concerning him more and more spread through the country: and vast multitudes came together to hear him, and to be cured by him of their disorders.
042	LUK	005	016	But he himself was in the desert for retirement and prayer.
042	LUK	005	017	And on a certain day it happened that he was teaching, and there were sitting Pharisees, and doctors of the law, who had come from every town of Galilee, and Judea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord for healing them was exercised.
042	LUK	005	018	And behold, men carried on a couch a man who was a paralytic; and sought to bring him into the house, and to place him before him.
042	LUK	005	019	And not discovering by what means they could introduce him, because of the crowd, they went up to the roof, and through the tiling let him down with his little couch into the midst, before Jesus.
042	LUK	005	020	And seeing their faith, he saith to him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.
042	LUK	005	021	And the scribes and Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this that speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?
042	LUK	005	022	And Jesus knowing their reasoning, in reply said to them, Why do ye reason in your hearts?
042	LUK	005	023	for which is the easier? to say, Thy sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise and walk?
042	LUK	005	024	But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority upon earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the paralytic, ) I say to thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thy house.
042	LUK	005	025	And instantly he rose up before them, took up that on which he had lain, and went away to his house, giving glory to God.
042	LUK	005	026	And an extacy of admiration seized upon them all, and they glorified God; and they were filled with awe, saying, We have seen wondrously strange things to-day.
042	LUK	005	027	And after these things he went out, and saw a farmer of the taxes, named Levi, sitting at the custom-house: and he said unto him, Follow me.
042	LUK	005	028	And leaving all behind, he rose, and followed him.
042	LUK	005	029	And Levi made him a great entertainment at his house and there was a great number of publicans and others, sitting at table with them.
042	LUK	005	030	And their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?
042	LUK	005	031	And Jesus answering said unto them, They who are well, have no need of a physician: but they who have illness.
042	LUK	005	032	I came not to call righteous men, but sinners, to repentance.
042	LUK	005	033	Then said they unto him, Why do the disciples of John observe frequent fasts, and make prayers; but thine are eating and drinking?
042	LUK	005	034	And he said unto them, Can you make the children of the bridechamber fast, as long as the bridegroom is with them?
042	LUK	005	035	But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, then shall they fast in those days.
042	LUK	005	036	Then he spake a parable unto them, No man putteth a patch of new cloth on an old garment; but if otherwise, both the new makes a rent, and the patch from the new is not of a piece with the old.
042	LUK	005	037	And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; for if he doth, the new wine will burst the bottles, and it will itself be spilled, and the bottles be destroyed.
042	LUK	005	038	But new wine should be put into new bottles; then both are preserved.
042	LUK	005	039	And no man drinking old wine, immediately desires new: for he saith, The old is better.
042	LUK	006	001	AND it came to pass on the sabbath after the second day of the passover, that he was passing through the cornfields; and the disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them out in their hands.
042	LUK	006	002	Then said some of the Pharisees unto them, Why do ye that which is not lawful on the sabbath-day?
042	LUK	006	003	And Jesus answering said to them; Have ye never read what David did, when he was hungry, and those who were with him?
042	LUK	006	004	how he entered into the house of God, and took the loaves of shew-bread, and did eat, and gave also to those who were with him; which it was not lawful for any to eat, but the priests alone?
042	LUK	006	005	And he said, The Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath-day.
042	LUK	006	006	And it came to pass on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and a man was there, and his right hand was shrunk.
042	LUK	006	007	Then the scribes and Pharisees watched him, if he would heal on the sabbath-day, that they might find an accusation against him.
042	LUK	006	008	Now he knew their thoughts, and said to the man who had the withered hand, Rise, and stand in the midst. And he arose, and stood up.
042	LUK	006	009	Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you a question; Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath-day, or to do evil? to preserve life or to destroy it?
042	LUK	006	010	And looking round upon them all, he said to the man, Stretch out thine hand; and he did so: and his hand was restored sound as the other.
042	LUK	006	011	But they were filled with madness, and talked earnestly to each other what they could do to Jesus.
042	LUK	006	012	Now it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray and continued all night in an oratory of God.
042	LUK	006	013	And when it was day, he called his disciples to him; and elected from them twelve, whom he named Apostles:
042	LUK	006	014	Simon, whom he also called Peter, and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,
042	LUK	006	015	Matthew and Thomas, James son of Alpheus, and Simon called the Zealous,
042	LUK	006	016	Jude the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, who also was the traitor.
042	LUK	006	017	And coming down with them, he stood on a level spot: and the crowd of his disciples, and a vast multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;
042	LUK	006	018	and they who were disturbed with unclean spirits: and they were cured.
042	LUK	006	019	And all the multitude strove to touch him, for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all.
042	LUK	006	020	And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed are ye poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	006	021	Blessed are ye who hunger now, for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now, for ye shall laugh.
042	LUK	006	022	Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from them, and shall revile you, and shall cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man’s sake.
042	LUK	006	023	Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy; for, lo! your reward is great in heaven: for after the same manner did your fathers to the prophets.
042	LUK	006	024	But wo unto you who are rich! for ye have received your consolation.
042	LUK	006	025	Wo unto you who are full! for ye shall hunger. Wo unto you who laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.
042	LUK	006	026	Wo unto you, when men shall speak well of you! for just so did their fathers of the false prophets.
042	LUK	006	027	But I say to you who hear, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you;
042	LUK	006	028	bless those who curse you, and pray for those who wantonly insult you.
042	LUK	006	029	To him that smiteth thee on the cheek, offer the other also; and from him who would take from thee thy cloak, withhold not thy coat also.
042	LUK	006	030	And give to every one that asketh thee; and from him who would take thy goods, demand them not again.
042	LUK	006	031	And as ye would that men should do unto you, do ye also to them in like manner.
042	LUK	006	032	And if ye love them that love you, what thanks are due to you? for even sinners love those who love them.
042	LUK	006	033	And if ye do good to them who do good to you, what thanks have ye? do not even sinners the same thing?
042	LUK	006	034	And if ye lend to those, from whom ye hope to receive back again, what thanks are due to you? for sinners lend to sinners, that they may receive an equivalent.
042	LUK	006	035	But love your enemies, and do good and lend, hoping for nothing in return: and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Most High; for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the wicked.
042	LUK	006	036	Be ye therefore compassionate, as also your Father is compassionate.
042	LUK	006	037	And judge not, that ye be not judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned:
042	LUK	006	038	give, and there shall be given unto you; good measure pressed down, and shook, and running over, shall they give into your lap. For with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured back to you again.
042	LUK	006	039	And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind? will they not both fall into the pit?
042	LUK	006	040	The disciple is not above his teacher; but every one who is completely taught shall be as his master.
042	LUK	006	041	But why beholdest thou the mote which is in thy brother’s eye, but observest not the beam which is in thine own eye?
042	LUK	006	042	Or how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, permit me to take off the mote which is on thine eye, not seeing thyself the beam in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite! cast out the beam which is in thine eye, and then shalt thou see distinctly to take off the mote which is in thy brother’s eye.
042	LUK	006	043	For there is no good tree which produceth fruit of a bad quality; neither doth a tree of a bad sort produce good fruit.
042	LUK	006	044	Every tree is known by its own peculiar fruit. For men do not gather figs from off thorns, nor do they gather from the bramble a bunch of grapes.
042	LUK	006	045	A good man, out of the good treasure of his heart, produceth what is good; and a wicked man, from the evil treasure in his heart, produceth that which is evil: for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.
042	LUK	006	046	And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?
042	LUK	006	047	Every one who cometh to me, and heareth my words, and puts them in practice, I will shew you to whom he is like:
042	LUK	006	048	he is like to a man, building a house, who digged, and sunk deep, and laid the foundation on a rock; and when there was a flood, the river rushed violently against that house, and was not of force to shake it, for it was founded on a rock.
042	LUK	006	049	But he that heareth, and doth not practice, is like a man who built his house on the earth without a foundation; against which the river rushed violently, and immediately it fell; and the crash of the fall of that house was great.
042	LUK	007	001	NOW after he had finished all these sayings in the ears of the people, he entered into Capernaum.
042	LUK	007	002	And the servant of a certain centurion, who was very valuable to him, being seized with an illness, was ready to die.
042	LUK	007	003	But when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, entreating him that he would come and preserve the life of his servant.
042	LUK	007	004	And when they came to Jesus, they entreated him importunately, saying, He is a worthy man on whom thou wilt confer this favour:
042	LUK	007	005	for he loveth our nation, and hath himself built us a synagogue.
042	LUK	007	006	Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion dispatched towards him friends, saying to him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not deserving that thou shouldest enter beneath my roof.
042	LUK	007	007	Therefore neither did I think myself worthy to come unto thee, but speak in a word, and my servant will be cured.
042	LUK	007	008	For I also am a man under authority, and have under my command soldiers; and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come hither, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.
042	LUK	007	009	Then Jesus, on hearing these things, respected him highly, and turning to the multitude which was following him, he said, I tell you, I have not found such faith, even in Israel.
042	LUK	007	010	And they who were sent, on their return to the house, found the servant who was sick in perfect health.
042	LUK	007	011	And it came to pass the next day, that he went into a city called Nain; and a considerable number of his disciples went with him, and a vast multitude.
042	LUK	007	012	And as he drew near the gate of the city, behold, a dead man was carrying out, an only son to his mother, and she a widow; and a great concourse of the city was with her.
042	LUK	007	013	And when Jesus saw her, he was moved with compassion for her, and said unto her, Weep not.
042	LUK	007	014	And approaching, he touched the bier: and the bearers stood still; and he said, Young man, I say to thee, Arise.
042	LUK	007	015	And the dead man sat up, and began to speak: and he delivered him to his mother.
042	LUK	007	016	And fear fell on all, and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us, and that God hath looked down with mercy on his people.
042	LUK	007	017	And this account respecting him went abroad through all Judea, and all the region adjacent.
042	LUK	007	018	And his disciples informed John of all these things.
042	LUK	007	019	And John calling two certain persons of his disciples, sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that cometh, or are we to expect another?
042	LUK	007	020	Then the men came to him, saying, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that cometh, or are we to expect another?
042	LUK	007	021	And in that very hour he cured many of diseases and acute complaints, and evil spirits; and to many blind persons he gave sight.
042	LUK	007	022	And Jesus addressing them, said, Go, tell John what things ye have seen and heard: that the blind recover sight, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor have the gospel preached unto them.
042	LUK	007	023	And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended at me.
042	LUK	007	024	Now when John’s messengers were departed, he began to speak to the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?
042	LUK	007	025	But what went ye out to see? A man clothed in delicate garments? Behold, they who indulge in soft raiment, and delicate food, are in king’s palaces.
042	LUK	007	026	But what went ye out to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet.
042	LUK	007	027	For this is he of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.
042	LUK	007	028	For I tell you, of those born from woman, there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of heaven, is greater than he.
042	LUK	007	029	And all the people when they heard it, and the publicans, glorified God, being baptised with the baptism of John.
042	LUK	007	030	But the Pharisees and teachers of the law rejected the counsel of God towards themselves, not being baptised by him.
042	LUK	007	031	And the Lord said, To what then shall I compare the men of this generation? and to what are they like?
042	LUK	007	032	They are like to children sitting in the markets, and calling to each other, and saying, We have played the flute to you, and ye have not danced; we have raised the cry of mourning, and ye have not wept.
042	LUK	007	033	For John the Baptist came neither eating bread, nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil.
042	LUK	007	034	The Son of man is come eating and drinking, and ye say, A gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!
042	LUK	007	035	though wisdom hath been justified by her children.
042	LUK	007	036	Then one of the Pharisees invited him to eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to table.
042	LUK	007	037	And, behold, a certain woman in the city, who was a notorious offender, when she knew that Jesus was sitting at table in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster vessel of odoriferous balm,
042	LUK	007	038	and standing at his feet behind him, began to water his feet with her tears, and to wipe them with the hair of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the perfumed balm.
042	LUK	007	039	And when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he said within himself, If this man were a prophet, he would know who and what kind of a woman this is that toucheth him; for she is a notorious sinner.
042	LUK	007	040	And Jesus addressing himself to him said, Simon, I have somewhat to say to thee. And he said, Master, speak freely.
042	LUK	007	041	A certain creditor had two debtors, the one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.
042	LUK	007	042	But having nothing to pay, he forgave them both. Tell me, which of these, then, will love him most?
042	LUK	007	043	And Simon answering said, I suppose, he to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast judged rightly.
042	LUK	007	044	So turning to the woman, he said to Simon, Thou seest this woman? I came into thine house, even water for my feet thou gavest not; but she hath washed my feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.
042	LUK	007	045	One kiss hast thou not given me, but she from the time she hath come in, hath not ceased tenderly to kiss my feet.
042	LUK	007	046	My head with oil thou hast not anointed; but she hath anointed my feet with odoriferous balm.
042	LUK	007	047	For which cause, I tell thee, her many sins are forgiven, for she hath loved much: but to whom a little is forgiven, he loveth little.
042	LUK	007	048	And he said to her, Thy sins are forgiven.
042	LUK	007	049	And they who sat at table with him began to say in themselves, Who is this, who even forgives sins?
042	LUK	007	050	But he said unto the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.
042	LUK	008	001	AND it came to pass afterwards, that he went through every city and village, preaching and publishing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God, and the twelve with him.
042	LUK	008	002	And certain women who had been cured of evil spirits and sicknesses, Mary called Magdalene, from whom seven devils had gone out.
042	LUK	008	003	And Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod’s lieutenant-governor, and Susanna, and many others, who ministred to his support out of their possessions.
042	LUK	008	004	Now when a vast multitude was collected, even those who came to him out of every city, he spake by a parable.
042	LUK	008	005	A sower went out to sow his seed; and as he sowed, some fell by the road side, and was trodden under foot, and the birds of the air devoured it up.
042	LUK	008	006	And other seed fell on a rock, and vegetating, withered because it had no moisture.
042	LUK	008	007	And other seed fell amidst thorns, and the thorns springing up with it, choked it.
042	LUK	008	008	And some fell on good ground, and shooting up, produced fruit an hundred fold. So saying, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
042	LUK	008	009	Then his disciples asked him, saying. What might this parable mean?
042	LUK	008	010	And he said, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God; but to the rest in parables: that seeing they may not perceive, and hearing may not comprehend.
042	LUK	008	011	Now this is the parable: The seed is the word of God.
042	LUK	008	012	They by the road side, are such as hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh the word from their heart, that they should not be saved in believing.
042	LUK	008	013	And they on the rock, are such as when they have heard, with joy embrace the word; and these have not root, who for a time believe, and in a season of trial apostasize.
042	LUK	008	014	And that which fell among thorns, are they having heard, and going away, are choked by the cares, and wealth, and pleasures of life, and bring forth no perfect fruit.
042	LUK	008	015	But that on the good ground are they who having heard the word, retain it in a heart excellent and good, and bring forth fruit with patience.
042	LUK	008	016	No man lighting a lamp hides it with a cover, or putteth it under a bed, but on a stand, that they who are coming in, may see the light.
042	LUK	008	017	For there is nothing hid which shall not be made manifest, nor concealed, which shall not be known and brought to light.
042	LUK	008	018	Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, even what he seemeth to have shall be taken away from.
042	LUK	008	019	Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come near him because of the crowd.
042	LUK	008	020	And it was told him, saying, Thy mother and thy brethren are standing without, desirous of seeing thee.
042	LUK	008	021	Then he answered and said to them, My mother and my brethren are they, who hear the word of God, and practise it.
042	LUK	008	022	And it came to pass on one of the days, that he went himself into a ship, and his disciples, and said unto them, Let us pass over to the farther side of the lake. And they set fail.
042	LUK	008	023	And while they were on the passage, he went to sleep: and a hurricane of wind rushed down on the lake; and they were filled with water, and imminent danger.
042	LUK	008	024	Then they came and awoke him, saying, Master, Master, we are perishing. Then arising, he issued his command to the wind, and the billows of water, and they subsided, and there was a calm.
042	LUK	008	025	And he said to them, Where is your faith? And they feared and were astonished, saying one to another, Well! what a man is this! that he commands even the winds and the sea, and they obey him.
042	LUK	008	026	And they sailed over unto the region of the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee.
042	LUK	008	027	And as he landed, there met him a certain man from the city, who had devils for a long while, and kept no clothes on him, and never abode in a house, but in the tombs.
042	LUK	008	028	But when he saw Jesus, roaring out, he fell down before him, and said with a loud voice, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God Most High? I pray thee, torment me not.
042	LUK	008	029	For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man; for many times it had seized on him; and though under a guard, and bound with chains and fetters; yet bursting the bonds, he was driven by the devil into the desert places.
042	LUK	008	030	Then Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? and he said, Legion: for many devils were entered into him.
042	LUK	008	031	And he besought him that he would not order them to go into the abyss.
042	LUK	008	032	Now a herd of many swine was there feeding on the mountain; and they besought him that he would permit them to enter into them. And he permitted them.
042	LUK	008	033	Then the devils going out of the man, entered into the swine; and the herd rushed down a precipice into the lake, and was suffocated.
042	LUK	008	034	But when those who fed them saw what was done they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country places.
042	LUK	008	035	And they came out to see what had happened; and they came to Jesus, and found the man sitting, from whom the devils were gone out, clothed, and in his sound mind, at the feet of Jesus; and they were afraid.
042	LUK	008	036	Then they also who had seen how the demoniac was recovered, told them.
042	LUK	008	037	And the whole multitude of the country around the Gadarenes, entreated him to depart from them; for they were seized with great terror: and he embarked on the vessel, and returned.
042	LUK	008	038	And the man out of whom the devils had gone, besought him to be with him; but Jesus sent him away, saying,
042	LUK	008	039	Return to thy house, and declare what things God hath done for thee. And he went away, and published through the whole city what things Jesus had done for him.
042	LUK	008	040	And it came to pass, when Jesus returned, the people welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him.
042	LUK	008	041	And, behold, there came a man whose name was Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and falling at the feet of Jesus, he entreated him to come to his house;
042	LUK	008	042	for he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying: and as he was going, the multitude thronged him.
042	LUK	008	043	And a woman, who had a flux of blood, for twelve years, who had spent all her substance on physicians, and could not get a cure from any;
042	LUK	008	044	coming behind him, touched the fringe of his garment; and instantly the flux of her blood stopped.
042	LUK	008	045	And Jesus said, Who touched me? And when all denied, Peter, and those who were with him, said, Master, the multitudes throng and press thee, and sayest thou, Who hath touched me?
042	LUK	008	046	Then said Jesus, Some person hath touched me, for I know that miraculous power is gone out from me.
042	LUK	008	047	Then the woman seeing she was not hid, came trembling, and falling down before him, declared to him before all the people, for what cause she had touched him; and how she was cured instantaneously.
042	LUK	008	048	Then he said unto her, Be of good cheer, daughter, thy faith hath made thee well; go in peace.
042	LUK	008	049	And while he was yet speaking, a person came to the ruler of the synagogue, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead, give the master no further trouble.
042	LUK	008	050	Then Jesus hearing it, addressed him, saying, Fear not, only believe, and she shall be saved.
042	LUK	008	051	And entering into the house, he suffered no person to come in, but Peter, and James, and John, and the father and mother of the child.
042	LUK	008	052	Now all were weeping and lamenting her: and he said, Weep not, she is not dead, but asleep.
042	LUK	008	053	And they derided him, for they knew that she was dead.
042	LUK	008	054	And he put them all without, and taking her by the hand, cried, saying, Maid, arise!
042	LUK	008	055	And her spirit returned, and she immediately arose; and he commanded to give her something to eat.
042	LUK	008	056	And her parents were struck with amazement. But he enjoined them to tell no man what was done.
042	LUK	009	001	THEN calling his twelve disciples, he gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.
042	LUK	009	002	And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.
042	LUK	009	003	And he said to them, Take nothing for the journey, neither staffs, nor satchel, nor bread, nor money, nor have two coats each.
042	LUK	009	004	And into whatsoever house ye enter, there abide, and thence go out.
042	LUK	009	005	And whosoever shall not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the dust from your feet, for a testimony against them.
042	LUK	009	006	And they went forth, and passed through the villages, preaching the gospel, and performing cures everywhere.
042	LUK	009	007	Then Herod the tetrarch heard of all things that were done by him; and he was in much distraction of mind, because it was said by some, that John was risen from the dead:
042	LUK	009	008	and of some that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one of the ancient prophets was risen again.
042	LUK	009	009	And Herod said, John I beheaded; but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he sought to see him.
042	LUK	009	010	And when the apostles returned, they told him what they had done. And taking them, he withdrew privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.
042	LUK	009	011	But when the multitudes knew it, they followed him and receiving them, he spake to them concerning the kingdom of God, and healed those who had need of a cure.
042	LUK	009	012	Now the day began to decline: and the twelve coming to him, said, Dismiss the multitude, that going away into the villages and farms round about, they may lodge and find provision; for here we are in a desert place.
042	LUK	009	013	Then he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more than five loaves, and two fishes; unless we go somewhere and buy provisions for all this multitude:
042	LUK	009	014	for there were about five thousand men. Then said he to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties each in companies.
042	LUK	009	015	And they did so: and they made them all sit down.
042	LUK	009	016	And taking the five loaves, and the two fishes, looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.
042	LUK	009	017	And they did all eat, and were filled; and there were taken up of the fragments which were more than enough for them, twelve baskets.
042	LUK	009	018	And it came to pass, as he had been praying in retirement, his disciples were with him, and he asked them, Who do the multitudes say that I am?
042	LUK	009	019	And they answering said, John the Baptist; but some Elias; and others, that one of the old prophets is risen again.
042	LUK	009	020	And he said to them, But who do ye say that I am? Then Peter answering said, The Messiah of God.
042	LUK	009	021	And strictly charging them, he commanded, that they should tell no man this:
042	LUK	009	022	saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, and chief priests, and scribes, and be put to death, and on the third day rise again.
042	LUK	009	023	And he said unto them, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.
042	LUK	009	024	For whosoever would preserve his life shall lose it; but whosoever would lose his life for my sake, shall preserve it.
042	LUK	009	025	For what advantage hath a man in gaining all the would, if he destroy himself, or be punished with the loss of life?
042	LUK	009	026	For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in his own glory, and his father’s, and of the holy angels.
042	LUK	009	027	And I tell you of a certainty, there are some of those who stand here, who shall not taste death, till they see the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	009	028	And it was about eight days after these discourses, that taking Peter, and John, and James, he went up into a mountain to pray.
042	LUK	009	029	And it came to pass, as he was at prayer, that the appearance of his countenance was altered, and his raiment white and refulgent.
042	LUK	009	030	And, lo! two men conversed with him, who were Moses and Elias:
042	LUK	009	031	who appeared in glory, and mentioned his departure, which he was ready to accomplish at Jerusalem.
042	LUK	009	032	But Peter and they who were with him were weighed down with sleep: but when they awoke, they beheld his glory, and the two men who were standing with them.
042	LUK	009	033	And it came to pass, as they were departing from him, Peter said unto Jesus, it is well that we are here, and we will make three tents, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias; not knowing what he said.
042	LUK	009	034	And as he was thus speaking, a cloud came and overshadowed them: and they were afraid as they were entering into the cloud.
042	LUK	009	035	And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son; hear him.
042	LUK	009	036	And when the voice ceased, Jesus was found alone. And they held their peace, and told no man in those days a word of the things which they had seen.
042	LUK	009	037	And it came to pass, on the next day, when they came down from the mountain, a great multitude met him.
042	LUK	009	038	And, behold, a man from among the multitude cried out aloud, saying, Master, I pray thee, look upon my son; for he is my only begotten.
042	LUK	009	039	And, behold! a spirit taketh him, and suddenly he crieth out, and convulseth him, with foaming; and bruising him, with difficulty retires from him.
042	LUK	009	040	And I besought thy disciples that they would cast him out, and they could not.
042	LUK	009	041	Then Jesus answering, said, O faithless and perverse generation! how long shall I be with you, how long shall I bear with you? bring hither thy son.
042	LUK	009	042	And while he was yet approaching the devil threw him down, and violently convulsed him. Then Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and cured the child; and restored him to his father.
042	LUK	009	043	And they were all struck with amazement at the mighty power of God. And while they were all wondering at the things which Jesus did, he said to his disciples,
042	LUK	009	044	Keep ye these sayings in your ears; for the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men.
042	LUK	009	045	And they understood not that declaration, and it was hid from them, that they should not comprehend its meaning: and they were afraid to ask him concerning that saying.
042	LUK	009	046	Then a dispute sprang up among them, which of them should be the greatest.
042	LUK	009	047	But Jesus knowing the reasoning of their hearts, took a little boy, and set him by his side,
042	LUK	009	048	and said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this little child in my name, receiveth me; and whosoever receiveth me, receiveth Him that sent me: for he who is the least among you all, he shall be great.
042	LUK	009	049	Then John addressing him said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and we forbad him, because he followed not with us.
042	LUK	009	050	And Jesus said to him, Forbid him not; for he that is not against us, is for us.
042	LUK	009	051	And it came to pass, as the days hastened to their period when he should be received up to glory, that he resolutely set his face to go to Jerusalem;
042	LUK	009	052	and sent messengers before his face; and they advancing entered into a Samaritan village, to make preparation for him.
042	LUK	009	053	And they would not admit him, because his face was directed to Jerusalem.
042	LUK	009	054	And when the disciples James and John saw it, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and destroy them, just as Elias did?
042	LUK	009	055	And turning to them, he reproved them, and said, Ye know not what spirit ye are of:
042	LUK	009	056	for the Son of man came not to destroy men’s lives, but to preserve them. And he proceeded to another village.
042	LUK	009	057	And it came to pass, as they were walking on the road, a certain person said to him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.
042	LUK	009	058	And Jesus Said to him, The foxes have holts, and the birds of the air, nests, but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.
042	LUK	009	059	And he said to another, Follow me. And he said, Lord, permit me first to return home, and put my father in his grave.
042	LUK	009	060	And Jesus said unto him, Leave the dead to bury their own dead, but go thou, preach the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	009	061	Then said another, I will follow thee, Lord, but give me leave first to bid adieu to those at my house.
042	LUK	009	062	But Jesus said unto him, No man laying his hand on the plough, and looking to the things left behind, is fit for the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	010	001	THEN after these things the Lord appointed other seventy persons also, and sent them, two and two before his face, into every city and place, whither he himself designed to go.
042	LUK	010	002	He said therefore unto them, The harvest indeed is plenteous, but the labourers few: pray ye therefore to the Lord of the harvest, that he would send out labourers into his harvest.
042	LUK	010	003	Go forth! behold, I send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves.
042	LUK	010	004	Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor sandals: and stay to salute no man on the road.
042	LUK	010	005	And into whatever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house.
042	LUK	010	006	And if the Son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it; but if not, it shall return back to you again.
042	LUK	010	007	And in the same family abide, eating and drinking such as they have: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not about from house to house.
042	LUK	010	008	And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they welcome you, eat whatever is set before you:
042	LUK	010	009	and heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.
042	LUK	010	010	And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go out into the streets of it, and say,
042	LUK	010	011	Even the dust of your city, which sticks to us, we shake off against you: nevertheless this know, that the kingdom of God is come near to you.
042	LUK	010	012	Now I tell you, that it shall be more tolerable for Sodom in that day, than for that city.
042	LUK	010	013	Wo to thee Chorazin! wo to thee Bethsaida! for if the miracles which have been done in thee, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, long ago sitting in sackcloth and ashes, would they have repented.
042	LUK	010	014	But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.
042	LUK	010	015	And thou Capernaum, which hast been lifted up to heaven, shalt be cast down to hell.
042	LUK	010	016	He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that despiseth you, despiseth me; and he that despiseth me, despiseth Him that sent me.
042	LUK	010	017	Then the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject to us through thy name.
042	LUK	010	018	And he said unto them, I beheld Satan falling as lightning from heaven.
042	LUK	010	019	Behold, I give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing shalt in any wise hurt you.
042	LUK	010	020	Nevertheless, in this rejoice not, that the spirits are made subject to you; but rejoice rather, that your names are inscribed in the heavens.
042	LUK	010	021	In the same hour Jesus exulted in spirit, and said, I ascribe glory to thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and intelligent, and hast revealed them to babes: be it so, O Father! since such is thy good pleasure.
042	LUK	010	022	All things are given up to me by my Father: and no man knoweth who is the Son, but the Father; and who is the Father, but the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son is pleased to reveal him.
042	LUK	010	023	Then turning to the disciples, he said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things which ye see:
042	LUK	010	024	for I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see the things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear the things which ye hear, and have not heard them.
042	LUK	010	025	And, behold, a certain doctor of the law arose, to make trial of him, saying, Master, by doing what shall I inherit eternal life?
042	LUK	010	026	And he said unto him, What is written in the law? How readest thou?
042	LUK	010	027	And he answering said, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might, and with all thy understanding, and thy neighbour as thyself.”
042	LUK	010	028	And he said unto him, Thou hast answered rightly: this do, and thou shalt live.
042	LUK	010	029	Then he, desirous to make himself appear a righteous person, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?
042	LUK	010	030	Then Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers, who, when they had both stripped him, and covered him with wounds, got off, leaving him half dead.
042	LUK	010	031	And it so fell out, that a certain priest went down that way, and seeing him, he kept the opposite side of the road.
042	LUK	010	032	And a Levite also, in the same way, being near the place, came, and seeing him, kept the opposite side of the road.
042	LUK	010	033	But a certain Samaritan travelling, came by him, and seeing him, was moved with compassion,
042	LUK	010	034	and coming up to him, bound up his wounds, after pouring on them oil and wine; then setting him on his own beast, he led him to an inn, and took particular care of him.
042	LUK	010	035	And on the morrow, as he was departing, he took out of his purse two denarii, and gave them to the innkeeper, and said to him, Take great care of him; and whatever farther expence may be incurred, when I return, I will repay thee.
042	LUK	010	036	Which then of these three do you suppose to be the neighbour of him who fell into the robbers’ hands?
042	LUK	010	037	And he said, He that shewed mercy towards him. Then said Jesus to him, Go, and do thou exactly the same.
042	LUK	010	038	And it came to pass, as they were travelling, that he entered into a certain village; and a woman, named Martha, received him into her house.
042	LUK	010	039	And she had a sister called Mary, who sitting down also at the feet of Jesus, hearkened to his discourse.
042	LUK	010	040	But Martha was hurrying about to provide a large entertainment, and coming up to him, she said, Lord, is it no concern to thee, that my sister hath left me to make the whole provision by myself? bid her therefore to assist me.
042	LUK	010	041	But Jesus answering said to her, Martha, Martha, thou art anxious and disturbing thyself about many things.
042	LUK	010	042	But of one thing there is need: and Mary hath made her election of that good portion, which shall not be taken away from her.
042	LUK	011	001	AND it came to pass, as he was in a certain place praying, when he had done, one of his disciples said to him, Lord, teach us to pray, even as John also taught his disciples.
042	LUK	011	002	And he said unto them, When ye pray say, Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name: thy kingdom come: thy will be done as in heaven so upon earth.
042	LUK	011	003	Give us our necessary food, day by day:
042	LUK	011	004	and forgive us our sins, for we also forgive every one who is indebted to us. And bring us not into temptation; but deliver us from the wicked one.
042	LUK	011	005	And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and he shall go to him at midnight, and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves;
042	LUK	011	006	for a friend of mine is come to me off a journey, and I have nothing to set before him.
042	LUK	011	007	And he from within answering, shall say, Give me no farther trouble: my door is already locked, and my children are with me in bed; I am unable to rise and give thee.
042	LUK	011	008	I tell you, though even he would not rise and give him because he is his friend; yet because of his importunity, roused up, he will give him as many as he needeth.
042	LUK	011	009	And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.
042	LUK	011	010	For every one who asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
042	LUK	011	011	For what father of you, if his son ask a loaf, will he give him a stone? or if a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?
042	LUK	011	012	or if he ask also an egg, will he give him a scorpion?
042	LUK	011	013	If ye then, evil as ye are, know how to give good gifts to your children; how much more shall your Father, who is in heaven, give his Holy Spirit to those who ask him?
042	LUK	011	014	And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb person spake, and the people marvelled.
042	LUK	011	015	But some of them said, He casteth out devils by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.
042	LUK	011	016	But others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven.
042	LUK	011	017	But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste; and a house against a house, falleth.
042	LUK	011	018	And if Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom be established? because ye say, that I cast out devils by Beelzebub.
042	LUK	011	019	But if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.
042	LUK	011	020	But if with the finger of God I cast out devils, then, verily the kingdom of God is come unto you.
042	LUK	011	021	When a strong man, in complete armour, guards his palace, his goods are in peace.
042	LUK	011	022	But when a stronger person than he coming, vanquisheth him, he takes away his suit of armour in which he confided, and distributes the spoils.
042	LUK	011	023	He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me, scattereth abroad.
042	LUK	011	024	When the unclean spirit goeth out of a man, he passes through places destitute of water, seeking repose; and not finding it, saith, I will go back to my habitation from whence I came out:
042	LUK	011	025	and coming, he findeth it swept and furnished.
042	LUK	011	026	Then goeth he, and taketh seven other spirits, more wicked than himself; and they entering in, take up their abode there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.
042	LUK	011	027	And it came to pass as he was speaking these words, a certain woman from among the multitude lift up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the breasts which thou hast sucked.
042	LUK	011	028	But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they who hear the word of God and observe it.
042	LUK	011	029	Then the multitudes thronging around him, he began to say, This is a wicked generation: it seeketh a sign, and no sign shall be given it, but the sign of Jonah the prophet.
042	LUK	011	030	For as Jonas was a sign to the Ninevites, so shall the Son of man also be to this generation.
042	LUK	011	031	The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment against the men of this generation, and shall condemn them: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.
042	LUK	011	032	The men of Nineveh shall rise up in judgment against this generation, and shall condemn it, for they repented on the preaching of Jonah, and, behold, a greater than Jonah is here.
042	LUK	011	033	But no man lighting a lamp putteth it in a concealed place, or under a bushel, but on a stand, that they who are coming in, may see the light.
042	LUK	011	034	The lamp of the body is the eye: when therefore thine eye is clear, thy whole body will be luminous, but if it be vitiated, thy whole body will be darkened.
042	LUK	011	035	Let it be thy aim then, that the light which is in thee do not become darkness.
042	LUK	011	036	If then thy whole body be illuminated, not having any dark part, it will be wholly luminous, as a lamp by its brightness diffuseth light.
042	LUK	011	037	Now as he was speaking, a certain Pharisee invited him to dine with him; and going in with him, he sat down.
042	LUK	011	038	But the Pharisee seeing it, marvelled, that he had not washed before dinner.
042	LUK	011	039	Then said the Lord unto him, Now ye Pharisees make the outside of the cup and of the dish clean, but your inward parts are full of extortion and wickedness.
042	LUK	011	040	Ye senseless men! did not he who made that which is without, make also that which is within?
042	LUK	011	041	But give what is within them for alms; and, lo! all will be pure unto you.
042	LUK	011	042	But wo to you, Pharisees, because ye tithe mint, and rue, and every herb, and pass by judgment and the love of God. These ought ye to have done, and not to have omitted the other.
042	LUK	011	043	Wo unto you, Pharisees, for ye love the first seats in the synagogues, and salutations in the places of public concourse.
042	LUK	011	044	Wo unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as graves concealed, which men, while walking over them, see not.
042	LUK	011	045	Then one of the doctors of the law addressing him, said, Master, thus speaking, thou reproachest us also.
042	LUK	011	046	And he said, Wo also to you, teachers of the law! for ye load men with burdens hardly bearable, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.
042	LUK	011	047	Wo unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.
042	LUK	011	048	Ye do indeed bear witness to, and with pleasure concur in your fathers’ deeds; for they truly killed them, and ye build their sepulchres.
042	LUK	011	049	Therefore also the wisdom of God hath said, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall kill, and shall persecute:
042	LUK	011	050	that the blood of all the prophets, which hath been shed since the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation:
042	LUK	011	051	from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah, who was slain between the altar and the temple: verily I tell you, It shall be required of this generation.
042	LUK	011	052	Wo unto you, teachers of the law! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge; ye yourselves enter not in, and those who were entering ye have hindered.
042	LUK	011	053	And as he was saying these things unto them, the scribes and Pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to extort answers from him respecting many things;
042	LUK	011	054	laying snares for him, and seeking to catch hold of something from his mouth, that they might accuse him.
042	LUK	012	001	MEANTIME myriads of people collecting, so that they trod on one another, he began to speak to his disciples, Take heed principally of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
042	LUK	012	002	For there is nothing concealed, that shall not be laid open; nor hid, which shall not be known.
042	LUK	012	003	Wherefore whatsoever things ye have spoken in darkness, they shall be reported in the light; and what ye have whispered into the ear in the closets, shall be proclaimed on the house-tops.
042	LUK	012	004	But I say to you my friends, Be not afraid of those who may kill the body, but after that, have nothing farther which they can do.
042	LUK	012	005	But I will point out to you, whom ye should fear: Fear him, who, after he hath killed, hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him!
042	LUK	012	006	Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, yet not one of them is forgotten before God?
042	LUK	012	007	But even the hairs of your head are all numbered: fear not then, ye are of more value than many sparrows.
042	LUK	012	008	But I tell you, Every one who shall confess me before men, him will the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:
042	LUK	012	009	but he that disowns me before men, shall be disowned before the angels of God.
042	LUK	012	010	And every one who shall utter a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but for him who hath blasphemed against the Holy Ghost, there shall be no forgiveness.
042	LUK	012	011	And when they shall bring you before the synagogues, and magistrates, and the ruling powers, be under no anxiety how or what defence ye shall make, or what ye shall say:
042	LUK	012	012	for the Holy Ghost will teach you at that very hour what ye ought to say.
042	LUK	012	013	Then spake one of the multitude to him, Master, order my brother to divide the inheritance with me.
042	LUK	012	014	But he said to him, Man, who made me a judge and a divider among you?
042	LUK	012	015	Then said he to them, Beware, and be on your guard against covetousness; for a man’s life doth not depend on the abundance of his possessions.
042	LUK	012	016	And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The estate of a certain rich man bore plentifully:
042	LUK	012	017	and he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do? for I have not room where I may house my crops.
042	LUK	012	018	And he said, I will do this; I will take down my barns, and build them larger, and collect there all my crops, and my good things!
042	LUK	012	019	And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast a multitude of good things in store for many years, be at ease, eat, drink, and be merry!
042	LUK	012	020	But God said to him, Thou fool! this night shall they demand thy life from thee; and the things which thou hast prepared, whose shall they be?
042	LUK	012	021	Just such is every one who heapeth up treasure for self, and is not rich towards God.
042	LUK	012	022	Then said he to his disciples, For this reason I tell you, Be under no anxiety about your life, what ye shall eat, nor for your body, how ye shall be clothed.
042	LUK	012	023	The life is more than food, and the body than raiment.
042	LUK	012	024	Consider the ravens, for they neither sow nor reap; they have neither storehouse nor barn; yet God feedeth them: how much are ye more excellent than the birds?
042	LUK	012	025	Which of you, with all his anxiety, can add one moment to his life?
042	LUK	012	026	If therefore ye are unable to do the least thing, why are ye anxious about the others?
042	LUK	012	027	Observe the lillies how they grow up, they toil not, nor spin; but I tell you, that Solomon in all his glory, was not arrayed like one of these.
042	LUK	012	028	If God then so clothe the grass in the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is thrown into the furnace; how much more you, O ye of little faith?
042	LUK	012	029	So then be not ye inquisitive what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, nor be agitated with restless anxiety.
042	LUK	012	030	For after all these things are the nations of the world seeking; and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.
042	LUK	012	031	But seek ye the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be given you over.
042	LUK	012	032	Fear not, little flock! for your Father takes delight in giving you the kingdom.
042	LUK	012	033	Sell all your possessions, and give in charity; make yourselves purses that wax not old, a treasure never failing in the heavens, where no thief approaches, nor doth the moth destroy.
042	LUK	012	034	For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
042	LUK	012	035	Let your loins be firmly girded round, and your lamps burning:
042	LUK	012	036	and ye like men, expecting their master, when he shall return from the marriage; that when he comes and knocks, they may instantly open the door for him.
042	LUK	012	037	Blessed are those servants, whom the Master, when he cometh, shall find watchful: verily I say unto you, that he will gird up himself, and make them sit down at table, and come and wait upon them.
042	LUK	012	038	And if he come in the second watch, or in the third watch, and find them so watchful, blessed are those servants.
042	LUK	012	039	Now this be assured of, that if the master of the family had known at what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken through.
042	LUK	012	040	Therefore be ye also ready, for at an hour that ye think not of, the Son of man cometh.
042	LUK	012	041	Then said Peter unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable to us, or also for all?
042	LUK	012	042	And the Lord said, Who indeed is a faithful steward, and prudent, whom the lord will place over his household, to give them their proportion of provision at the proper season?
042	LUK	012	043	Blessed is that servant, whom his lord, when he cometh, shall find so employed.
042	LUK	012	044	Verily I say unto you, that he will place him over all his property.
042	LUK	012	045	But if that servant say in his heart, My master will be a long while ere he comes; and shall begin to beat the men and maid-servants, and to eat and to drink, and to get drunk;
042	LUK	012	046	the master of that servant will come in a day when he doth not expect him, and at an hour which he knoweth not, and shall cut him asunder, and give him his portion with the unfaithful.
042	LUK	012	047	And that servant, who knew his master’s will, and made no preparation for him, nor did according to his pleasure, shall be beaten with many stripes.
042	LUK	012	048	But he that knew it not, yet did things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few. For of every one to whom much is given, much shall be required from him: and to whom men commit much, they will of him demand abundantly more.
042	LUK	012	049	I am come to cast fire on the earth, and what is my wish? that it may be now kindled.
042	LUK	012	050	But I have a baptism to be baptised with; and how am I distressed in spirit till it is finished!
042	LUK	012	051	Think ye that I came to bring peace upon earth? No, I tell you; but rather division:
042	LUK	012	052	for henceforth five shall be in one house, divided, three against two, and two against three.
042	LUK	012	053	The father shall take part against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the step-mother against her daughter-in-law, and the son’s wife against her mother-in-law.
042	LUK	012	054	Then said he to the multitudes, When ye see a cloud rising from the west, ye say immediately, There cometh a shower; and it is so.
042	LUK	012	055	And when the south wind gently blows, ye say, It will be sultry hot; and so it is.
042	LUK	012	056	Ye hypocrites! ye know how to discern by experience from the appearance of the earth and of the sky; but how is it that ye do not discern this particular time?
042	LUK	012	057	And why even of yourselves do ye not decide what is just?
042	LUK	012	058	For as thou art going with thy prosecutor to the magistrate, on the way endeavour to make up the matter with him; lest he drag thee before the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison.
042	LUK	012	059	I tell thee, thou mayest in no wise come out from thence, until thou hast paid the very last mite.
042	LUK	013	001	NOW there were some present at that time who informed him of the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.
042	LUK	013	002	And Jesus in reply said to them, Think ye that these Galileans were sinners above all the Galileans, because they suffered such things?
042	LUK	013	003	I tell you, No: for except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
042	LUK	013	004	Or those eighteen, on whom the tower in Siloam fell, and killed them, think ye that they were debtors to divine justice above all the men who dwell at Jerusalem?
042	LUK	013	005	I tell you, No: but except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
042	LUK	013	006	Then he spake this parable: A certain man had a fig-tree planted in his vineyard; and he came, expecting fruit on it, and found none.
042	LUK	013	007	Then said he to the vine-dresser, Lo! for three years have I come, expecting fruit on this fig-tree, and find none: cut it down; why doth it render the ground thus useless?
042	LUK	013	008	He answering said to him, Sir, let it e’en remain this year, until that I dig around it, and spread some manure:
042	LUK	013	009	perhaps it may then produce fruit: but if it does not, afterwards thou shalt cut it down.
042	LUK	013	010	And he was teaching in one of the synagogues, on the sabbath.
042	LUK	013	011	And, behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and unable to raise herself at all up.
042	LUK	013	012	But when Jesus saw her, he called out aloud, and said to her, Woman, thou art delivered from thine infirmity.
042	LUK	013	013	And he laid his hands upon her: and instantly she became erect, and glorified God.
042	LUK	013	014	Then the ruler of the synagogue, indignant, that on the sabbath Jesus had performed the cure, addressing himself to the multitude, said, There are six days in which work is to be done: on these therefore come and be cured, and not on the sabbath-day.
042	LUK	013	015	Then the Lord answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not every one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the manger, and lead him to water?
042	LUK	013	016	And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, to be loosed from this bond on the sabbath-day?
042	LUK	013	017	And when he had made this speech, all his opposers were covered with shame: and all the multitude rejoiced in all the glorious things which were done by him.
042	LUK	013	018	Then said he, To what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I compare it?
042	LUK	013	019	It is like a grain of mustard, which a man took and put into his garden; and it grew, and became a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged on its branches.
042	LUK	013	020	And again he said, To what shall I liken the kingdom of God?
042	LUK	013	021	It is like leaven, which a woman taking, covered up in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.
042	LUK	013	022	And he passed through the cities and villages, teaching, and making his way towards Jerusalem.
042	LUK	013	023	And a person said to him, Lord, are the saved few? And he said unto them,
042	LUK	013	024	Exert all your powers to enter through the strait gate: for many, I tell you, will seek to enter, but will not be able.
042	LUK	013	025	When the master of the family shall have arisen, and shut the door, and ye shall begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Master, master, open it for us! and he answering will tell you, I know you not whence ye are:
042	LUK	013	026	then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.
042	LUK	013	027	And he will say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.
042	LUK	013	028	There shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom, and yourselves cast out.
042	LUK	013	029	And they shall come from the east, and west, and from north, and south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	013	030	And, behold, there are last who shall be first, and there are first who shall be last.
042	LUK	013	031	The same day came certain Pharisees, saying to him, Depart, and begone from hence: for Herod will kill thee.
042	LUK	013	032	And he said to them, Go tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and perform cures today and to-morrow, and on the third day I shall be perfected.
042	LUK	013	033	But I must go on to-day and to-morrow, and the day following: for it is impossible that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.
042	LUK	013	034	O Jerusalem! Jerusalem! thou that killest the prophets, and stonest those who are sent unto thee; how often would I have collected thy children unto me, just as a hen gathereth her brood under her wings, and ye would not!
042	LUK	013	035	Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: verily I say unto you, That ye shall see me no more, till the day come when ye shall say, Blessed is he who cometh in the name of the Lord.
042	LUK	014	001	AND it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the principal Pharisees, to eat bread on the sabbath, that they were watchfully observant of him.
042	LUK	014	002	And, behold, there was a certain man who had a dropsy, before him.
042	LUK	014	003	And Jesus addressing himself to the teachers of the law and the Pharisees, spake, saying, Is it lawful to perform cures on the sabbath?
042	LUK	014	004	And they said nothing. And he took him, and healed him, and sent him away;
042	LUK	014	005	and addressing them, said, Whose ass or ox is fallen into a pit, and doth he not immediately pull him out on the sabbath-day?
042	LUK	014	006	And they were unable to answer him in opposition to these things.
042	LUK	014	007	Then he spake to those who were invited, a parable, when he observed how they chose the principal seats; saying unto them,
042	LUK	014	008	When thou art invited of any person to a marriage entertainment, recline not on the principal couch; lest a more honourable personage than thyself be invited by him;
042	LUK	014	009	and he that invited thee and him, coming say to thee, Yield this person the place; and so thou shalt begin with shame to go down to the lowest place.
042	LUK	014	010	But when thou art invited, go and sit down in the lowest place; that when he who invited thee comes, he may say to thee, Friend, go up higher; then shalt thou have respect in the presence of those who are seated with thee.
042	LUK	014	011	For every one who exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
042	LUK	014	012	Then said he also to the person who had invited him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, invite not thy friends, nor thy brethren, nor thy relations, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also invite thee again, and a recompence be made to thee.
042	LUK	014	013	But when thou makest an entertainment, invite the poor, the maimed, the halt, the blind:
042	LUK	014	014	and thou shalt be blessed; because they cannot recompense thee: for a recompence shall be made thee at the resurrection of the just.
042	LUK	014	015	Then one of those who sat at table hearing these things, said to him, Blessed is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	014	016	And he said unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and invited many:
042	LUK	014	017	and sent his servants at supper-time to say to the invited, Come; for all things are now ready.
042	LUK	014	018	And they all began with one voice to frame excuses. The first said to him, I have bought a field, and I must of necessity go and survey it: I pray thee hold me excused.
042	LUK	014	019	And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and am going to make a trial of them: I pray thee accept my excuse.
042	LUK	014	020	And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.
042	LUK	014	021	And that servant returning, informed his master of these things. Then the master of the family, being highly incensed, said to his servant, Go out instantly into the streets and alleys of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind.
042	LUK	014	022	And the servant said, Sir, it is done as thou orderedst, and yet there is room.
042	LUK	014	023	And the master said to the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and urge them to come in, that my house may be filled.
042	LUK	014	024	For I say unto you, That not one man of those who were invited shall taste of my supper.
042	LUK	014	025	And great multitudes followed him about: and he turned, and spoke to them,
042	LUK	014	026	If any man cometh after me, and hateth not father, and mother, and wife and children, and brothers, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.
042	LUK	014	027	And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, he cannot be my disciple.
042	LUK	014	028	For what man of you designing to erect a tower, doth not first sitting down calculate the expence, if he have sufficient to complete the work?
042	LUK	014	029	lest haply, after having laid the foundation, and being unable to finish it, all who look upon it begin to ridicule him,
042	LUK	014	030	saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.
042	LUK	014	031	Or what king, going forth to encounter another king in battle, doth not sit down first, and consult if he is able with ten thousand men to meet him who is coming against him with twenty thousand?
042	LUK	014	032	and if he be not, whilst he is still at a distance, he sendeth an embassy, and desires terms of peace.
042	LUK	014	033	So then, every one of you who will not part with all his possessions, cannot be my disciple.
042	LUK	014	034	Salt is good: but if the salt become insipid, by what shall it be seasoned?
042	LUK	014	035	It is neither fit for the land, nor for manure; but they cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
042	LUK	015	001	THEN drew nigh unto him all the tax-farmers and the sinners to hear him.
042	LUK	015	002	And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man entertains sinners, and eateth with them.
042	LUK	015	003	Then spake he unto them this parable, saying,
042	LUK	015	004	What man is there of you, possessing an hundred sheep, though he lose but one of them, will he not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?
042	LUK	015	005	and when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing.
042	LUK	015	006	And coming home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Congratulate me; for I have found that sheep of mine which was lost.
042	LUK	015	007	I tell you, that just so will there be joy in heaven over one repentant sinner, more than over ninety-nine righteous persons, who hold not their need of repentance.
042	LUK	015	008	Or what woman having ten pieces of silver coin, if she lose one of them, doth she not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and make diligent search until she find it?
042	LUK	015	009	And having found it, she calleth her female friends and neighbours together, saying, Congratulate me; for I have found the silver piece I had lost.
042	LUK	015	010	Even so, I tell you, there is joy among the angels of God, over one repentant sinner.
042	LUK	015	011	Then he said, A certain man had two sons:
042	LUK	015	012	and the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of substance which falls to my share. And he divided with them his fortune.
042	LUK	015	013	And not many days after, the younger son, collecting his all, travelled into a far distant country, and there dissipated his substance in a life of debauchery.
042	LUK	015	014	But when he had spent all, there came a terrible famine in that region; and he began to know want.
042	LUK	015	015	And he went and connected himself with one of the citizens of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.
042	LUK	015	016	And he eagerly longed to fill his belly with the charob berries which the swine did eat: and no person gave him a morsel.
042	LUK	015	017	Then coming to himself, he said, How many hirelings of my father abound with loaves of bread, and I am pining away with famine!
042	LUK	015	018	I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,
042	LUK	015	019	and I am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hirelings.
042	LUK	015	020	And he arose and came to his father. But when he was yet at a considerable distance, his father discovered him, and was moved with compassion, and running, fell on his neck, and kissed him again and again.
042	LUK	015	021	Then said the son unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.
042	LUK	015	022	But the father said to his servants, Bring out the best robe, and clothe him; and put a ring on his hand, and sandals on his feet:
042	LUK	015	023	and bring hither the stall-fed steer, and kill it; and let us eat, and be joyous.
042	LUK	015	024	For this my son was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found. And they began to be joyous.
042	LUK	015	025	Now his elder brother had been in the field: and when coming home he drew near the house, he heard a concert of music, and the chorus.
042	LUK	015	026	And calling one of the servants, he inquired what these things meant.
042	LUK	015	027	And he said, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed for him the stall-fed steer, because he hath received him in health.
042	LUK	015	028	Then he was in great wrath, and would not enter the doors: therefore his father came out, and entreated him.
042	LUK	015	029	But he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years I am serving thee, and never have transgressed thy command: yet to me thou hast never once given a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:
042	LUK	015	030	but no sooner is this son of thine come, who hath devoured thy substance with whores, than thou hast killed for him the stall-fed steer.
042	LUK	015	031	And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all my possessions are thine.
042	LUK	015	032	But it was right that we should rejoice, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.
042	LUK	016	001	THEN said he also to his disciples, There was a certain rich man, who had a steward; and he received an information against him, as having dissipated his treasures.
042	LUK	016	002	And calling him, he said to him, What is this report I hear of thee? give up the account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer in that office.
042	LUK	016	003	Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? because my master is taking away the stewardship from me: to dig, I have not the strength; to beg, I am ashamed.
042	LUK	016	004	I know what I will do, that, when I am removed from the stewardship, they may entertain me at their houses.
042	LUK	016	005	So calling upon every one of his master’s debtors, he said to the first, How much owest thou to my master?
042	LUK	016	006	And he said, A hundred baths of oil. And he said, Take thy account, and sit down directly, and write fifty.
042	LUK	016	007	Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred core of wheat. And he saith to him, Take thy account, and write fourscore.
042	LUK	016	008	And the master praised the unjust steward, because he had acted providently: for the children of this world are more provident among their own generation of men, than the children of light.
042	LUK	016	009	And I say unto you, Make yourselves friends with the unrighteous mammon that when ye fail, they may receive you into the eternal mansions.
042	LUK	016	010	He that is faithful in the least thing, is faithful also in much: and he who is unjust in the least, is unjust also in much.
042	LUK	016	011	If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will entrust you with the true?
042	LUK	016	012	and if ye have not been faithful in that which belongs to another, who will give up to you that which is your own?
042	LUK	016	013	No domestic can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or he will cleave to the one, and neglect the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
042	LUK	016	014	Then the Pharisees also, who were dear lovers of money, heard all these things, and they sneered at him.
042	LUK	016	015	And he said unto them, Ye are they who affect to be righteous persons before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men, is an abomination in the sight of God.
042	LUK	016	016	The law and the prophets were until John: since that the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.
042	LUK	016	017	But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tittle of the law to fail.
042	LUK	016	018	Every one who putteth away his wife and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and every one who marrieth a woman divorced from her husband, committeth adultery.
042	LUK	016	019	Now there was a certain rich man, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, making splendid entertainments every day:
042	LUK	016	020	and there was a certain pauper, named Lazarus, who was laid at his gate covered with ulcers,
042	LUK	016	021	and importunately desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man’s table: yea even the dogs came and licked his ulcers.
042	LUK	016	022	Now it came to pass that the poor man died, and was carried up by angels into the bosom of Abraham. Then the rich man also died, and was buried:
042	LUK	016	023	and in hell, lifting up his eyes, being in torments, he seeth Abraham at a vast distance, and Lazarus in his bosom.
042	LUK	016	024	And crying out, he said, Father Abraham, have compassion on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented with this flame.
042	LUK	016	025	But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou hast received thy good things during thy life, and Lazarus, in like manner, what was afflictive: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.
042	LUK	016	026	And besides all these considerations, between us and you there is a vast chasm fixed: so that they who might be willing to pass from hence to you, cannot; neither can they pass through to us, from thence.
042	LUK	016	027	And he said, I entreat thee then, father, that thou wouldest send him to my paternal mansion:
042	LUK	016	028	for I have five brothers: that he may testify to them, that they also come not into this place of torment.
042	LUK	016	029	Abraham saith to him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hearken to them.
042	LUK	016	030	But he said, Ah no, father Abraham! but if one came to them from the dead, they will repent.
042	LUK	016	031	Then he said to him, If they hearken not to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead.
042	LUK	017	001	THEN he said to his disciples, It is impossible that offences should not come; but wo to him through whom they come!
042	LUK	017	002	It would be advantageous for him, if a milstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea, rather than offend one of these little ones.
042	LUK	017	003	Take heed to yourselves: if thy brother sin against thee, reprove him; and if he repent, forgive him.
042	LUK	017	004	And if seven times in the day he sin against thee, and seven times in the day return to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.
042	LUK	017	005	And the disciples said unto the Lord, increase our faith.
042	LUK	017	006	And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard, ye might say to that sycamore-tree, Be rooted up, and be planted in the sea; and it would obey you.
042	LUK	017	007	But which of you, having a servant plowing or keeping sheep, when he cometh from the field, will say immediately, Come, sit down at table?
042	LUK	017	008	And will he not rather say, Prepare for me to sup, and gird thyself, and wait upon me, till I eat and drink; and after that, thou shalt eat and drink thyself?
042	LUK	017	009	Doth he hold it as a favour from that servant, that he did the things which were ordered him? I think not.
042	LUK	017	010	So also ye, when ye have done all things commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: for we have but done what was our duty to do.
042	LUK	017	011	And it came to pass, as he was going towards Jerusalem, he passed also through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.
042	LUK	017	012	And as he was entering a certain village, ten leprous men met him, who stood at a distance:
042	LUK	017	013	and they lift up their voice, saying, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!
042	LUK	017	014	And looking towards them, he said, Go, shew yourselves to the priests. And it came to pass, that as they were on the road, they were made clean.
042	LUK	017	015	Then one of them, seeing that he was cured, returned, and with a loud voice gave glory to God,
042	LUK	017	016	and fell prostrate at his feet giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.
042	LUK	017	017	Then Jesus spake and said, were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?
042	LUK	017	018	There are none found returning to give glory to God, but this alien.
042	LUK	017	019	And he said to him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath saved thee.
042	LUK	017	020	And being asked by one of the Pharisees, When cometh the kingdom of God? he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:
042	LUK	017	021	neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.
042	LUK	017	022	Then said he to the disciples, The days will come when ye shall eagerly desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and shall not see it.
042	LUK	017	023	And they will say to you, Lo here! and lo there! go not after them, nor follow them.
042	LUK	017	024	For as the lightning flashing from one quarter under heaven, shineth to another quarter under heaven; so shall the Son of man also be at his day.
042	LUK	017	025	But he must first suffer many things, and be rejected by this generation.
042	LUK	017	026	And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it also be in the days of the coming of the Son of man.
042	LUK	017	027	They did eat, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the deluge came, and destroyed them all.
042	LUK	017	028	Even so, likewise, it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;
042	LUK	017	029	but the day Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.
042	LUK	017	030	Just so will it be in the day when the Son of man shall be revealed.
042	LUK	017	031	In that day, let not the man who is upon the roof, and his goods in the house, go down to carry them away: and he that is in the field, in like manner, let him not return for any things behind him.
042	LUK	017	032	Remember Lot’s wife.
042	LUK	017	033	Whosoever seeketh to preserve his life shall lose it; and whosoever would lose it, shall preserve it.
042	LUK	017	034	I tell you, in that night two shall be in the same bed; the one shall be seized, and the other dismissed. Two women shall be grinding together: the one shall be seized, and the other dismissed.
042	LUK	017	035	Two shall be in the field; the one shall be seized, and the other dismissed.
042	LUK	017	036	TEXT OMITTED
042	LUK	017	037	And they answering, said to him, Where, Lord? And he said, Wherever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.
042	LUK	018	001	THEN he spake also to them a parable, to shew that we ought to pray always, and not faint;
042	LUK	018	002	saying, There was a certain judge in a particular city, having no fear of God, nor respect for man:
042	LUK	018	003	and there was a certain widow in that city; and she came to him, saying, Do me justice against my adversary.
042	LUK	018	004	And he would not for a long while: but after this he said, Though I fear not God, nor respect man;
042	LUK	018	005	yet because this woman is so troublesome to me, I will do her justice, lest by her perpetual coming she stun me with her importunity,
042	LUK	018	006	Then said the Lord, Hear what the unjust judge saith.
042	LUK	018	007	And shall not God execute vengeance for his own elect, who cry out to him day and night, though he bear long with them?
042	LUK	018	008	Yes, I tell you, that he will avenge them quickly. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, ah! shall he find faith on the earth?
042	LUK	018	009	Then he spake also this parable to certain persons, who had confidence in themselves, that they were righteous, and despised others:
042	LUK	018	010	Two men went up to the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, the other a tax-farmer.
042	LUK	018	011	The Pharisee, standing by himself, made this prayer: God, I thank thee, that I am not as the rest of mankind, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or as this tax-gatherer.
042	LUK	018	012	I keep a fast twice a week, I pay the tenth of all things I possess.
042	LUK	018	013	And the tax-gatherer standing at a distance, would not even so much as lift his eyes heaven-ward, but smote on his breast, saying, May God accept the atonement for me a sinner!
042	LUK	018	014	I say to you, Went this man down to his house justified, or the other? for every one who exalteth himself shall be humbled; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
042	LUK	018	015	Then they brought him infants also, that he should touch them: but the disciples, when they saw it, rebuked them.
042	LUK	018	016	But Jesus calling them to him, said, Permit little children to come to me, and hinder them not for of such is the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	018	017	Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.
042	LUK	018	018	And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, by doing what shall I inherit eternal life?
042	LUK	018	019	Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good, but one, even God.
042	LUK	018	020	Thou knowest the commandments, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.
042	LUK	018	021	Then he said, All these things have I observed from my youth.
042	LUK	018	022	Then Jesus hearing this, said to him, Yet one thing thou lackest: sell all whatsoever thou hast, and distribute to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.
042	LUK	018	023	But he, on hearing these things, was exceeding sorrowful: for he was very rich.
042	LUK	018	024	Then Jesus, observing that he was very sorrowful, said, How difficultly shall they who have riches, enter into the kingdom of God!
042	LUK	018	025	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	018	026	And those who heard it said, Who then can be saved?
042	LUK	018	027	And he said, The things impossible with men, are possible with God.
042	LUK	018	028	Then said Peter, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.
042	LUK	018	029	And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, that there is no man who hath left family, or parents, or brothers, or wife, or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,
042	LUK	018	030	who shall not receive back manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.
042	LUK	018	031	Then taking aside the twelve, he said to them, Lo, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things written by the prophets concerning the Son of man will be fulfilled.
042	LUK	018	032	For he shall be delivered up to the Gentiles, and they shall insult him, and treat him with indignity, and spit upon him:
042	LUK	018	033	and after scourging, shall slay him: and the third day he shall rise again.
042	LUK	018	034	And they understood none of these things: and the saying was concealed from them, and they knew not the things which were spoken.
042	LUK	018	035	And it came to pass, as he drew nigh to Jerusalem, a certain blind man sat by the road-side begging:
042	LUK	018	036	and hearing the multitude passing by, he inquired what was the cause.
042	LUK	018	037	And they told him, that Jesus the Nazarean is going by.
042	LUK	018	038	And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me!
042	LUK	018	039	And they who were going before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, Son of David, have mercy on me!
042	LUK	018	040	Then Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be brought to him: and when he was come near, he asked him,
042	LUK	018	041	saying, What wist thou that I should do for thee? Then he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.
042	LUK	018	042	And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.
042	LUK	018	043	And instantly he received sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.
042	LUK	019	001	AND entering into Jericho, he passed through.
042	LUK	019	002	And there was a person whose name was Zaccheus, and he was a principal farmer of the taxes, and the man was rich.
042	LUK	019	003	And he was desirous to have a sight of Jesus, what sort of person he was; and he could not, because of the crowd, for he was short of stature.
042	LUK	019	004	So running before, he climbed up a sycamore-tree, in order to get a sight of him: for he was about to pass that way.
042	LUK	019	005	And when he was come to the spot, Jesus looking up, saw him, and said to him, Zaccheus, come down speedily; for to-day I must abide at thy house.
042	LUK	019	006	And he hastened to come down, and entertained him gladly.
042	LUK	019	007	And when they all saw it, they murmured, saying, That he is gone to lodge with a man, a notorious sinner.
042	LUK	019	008	Then Zaccheus standing up, said unto the Lord, Behold, the half of my goods, Lord, I give unto the poor; and if I have got any thing from any man, by laying false informations, I am ready to restore fourfold.
042	LUK	019	009	Then said Jesus unto him, To-day is salvation come to this house, because that he also is a son of Abraham.
042	LUK	019	010	For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.
042	LUK	019	011	And as they were hearkening to these things, he proceeded on, and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and they supposed that immediately the kingdom of God would openly appear.
042	LUK	019	012	He said therefore, A certain man of noble family went into a distant region, to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.
042	LUK	019	013	And calling his ten servants, he gave them ten manehs, and said unto them, Employ yourselves in traffic, till I come back.
042	LUK	019	014	But his citizens hated him, and sent an embassy after him, saying, We will not have this man to rule over us.
042	LUK	019	015	And it came to pass, at his return, after receiving the kingdom, that he ordered the servants to be called, to whom he had given the money, that he might know what every one had gained by his traffic.
042	LUK	019	016	Then came the first, and said, Sir, thy maneh has gained ten manehs.
042	LUK	019	017	And he said unto him, Well done, good servant: because thou hast been faithful in the least matter, hold thou dominion over ten cities.
042	LUK	019	018	And the second came, saying, Lord, thy maneh hath gained five manehs.
042	LUK	019	019	Then said he also to this man, Be thou also over five cities.
042	LUK	019	020	And another came, saying, Master, there is thy maneh, which I have kept wrapt up in a napkin:
042	LUK	019	021	for I was afraid of thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up where thou hadst laid nothing down, and reapest where thou didst not sow.
042	LUK	019	022	And he said to him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I am an austere man, taking up what I laid not down, and reaping what I did not sow;
042	LUK	019	023	why then gavest thou not my money to the bank, so when I came I might have required it with interest?
042	LUK	019	024	And he said to those who stood by, Take from him the maneh, and give it to him who hath the ten manehs.
042	LUK	019	025	(And they say unto him, Sir, he hath ten manehs.)
042	LUK	019	026	For I say unto you, That to every one who hath, shall more be given; but from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away from him.
042	LUK	019	027	But as for these enemies of mine, who would not that I should reign over them, bring them hither, and slay them before me.
042	LUK	019	028	And having thus spoken, he proceeded forward, going up to Jerusalem.
042	LUK	019	029	And it came to pass, as he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, to the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,
042	LUK	019	030	saying, Go into the opposite village; in which, as ye are at the entrance, ye will find a foal tied, on which no man hath ever yet sat: loose, and bring him.
042	LUK	019	031	And if any man ask you, Why ye loose it? thus shall ye say to him, That the Lord hath need of him.
042	LUK	019	032	Then they who were sent, going, found it just as he had described to them.
042	LUK	019	033	And as they were untying the foal, the owners of it said to them, Why loose ye the foal?
042	LUK	019	034	And they said, The Lord hath need of him.
042	LUK	019	035	And they brought him to Jesus: and throwing their cloaks on the foal, they set Jesus thereon.
042	LUK	019	036	And as he went, they spread under him their garments on the road.
042	LUK	019	037	And when he was now approaching, at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples rejoicing began to praise God with a loud voice for all the miracles which they had seen;
042	LUK	019	038	saying, Blessed is the King, who cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.
042	LUK	019	039	And some of the Pharisees from the crowd said unto him, Master, reprove thy disciples.
042	LUK	019	040	And he replying said to them. I tell you that, should these be silent, the very stones would cry out.
042	LUK	019	041	And as he drew near, beholding the city, he wept over it,
042	LUK	019	042	saying, Oh that thou hadst known, even in this thy day, the things that are for thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.
042	LUK	019	043	For the days will come upon thee, when thy enemies shall cast up a trench around thee, and encircle thee about, and straiten thee on every side,
042	LUK	019	044	and will dash thee on the ground, and thy children within thee; and will not leave in thee one stone upon another: because thou knewest not the season of thy visitation.
042	LUK	019	045	And entering into the temple, he began to cast out those who sold and bought in the temple;
042	LUK	019	046	saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of robbers.
042	LUK	019	047	And he continued daily teaching in the temple. Then the chief priests and the scribes sought to destroy him, with the heads of the people,
042	LUK	019	048	but did not discover how they could do any thing: for all the people attentively hung on his lips.
042	LUK	020	001	AND it came to pass, on one of those days, as he was teaching the people in the temple, and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and scribes with the elders came upon him,
042	LUK	020	002	and spake to him, saying, Tell us by what authority thou doest these things or who is he that giveth thee this authority?
042	LUK	020	003	Then he answering said to them, I also will ask you one question; and resolve me:
042	LUK	020	004	The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?
042	LUK	020	005	And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we reply, From heaven; he will say, Wherefore then did ye not believe him?
042	LUK	020	006	But if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.
042	LUK	020	007	And they answered, We know not from whence.
042	LUK	020	008	And Jesus said to them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.
042	LUK	020	009	Then he began to speak to the people this parable: A certain man planted a vineyard, and delivered it to husbandmen, and went abroad for a long while.
042	LUK	020	010	And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that they might give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat, and sent him away empty.
042	LUK	020	011	And he again sent another servant: and him also they beat, and treating him with indignity, sent him away empty.
042	LUK	020	012	And he sent yet a third: and him they also wounded, and cast out.
042	LUK	020	013	Then said the master of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: probably when they see him, they will shew him respect.
042	LUK	020	014	But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be our own.
042	LUK	020	015	So casting him out of the vineyard, they slew him. What then will the master of the vineyard do with these men?
042	LUK	020	016	He will come and destroy these husbandmen, and give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said God forbid.
042	LUK	020	017	Then he looked on them, and said, What is this then which is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?
042	LUK	020	018	Every one who falleth upon this stone shall be broken to pieces; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.
042	LUK	020	019	And the chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him at that time; and were afraid of the people: for they knew that he had spoken this parable against them.
042	LUK	020	020	And watching him, they sent men they had suborned, who pretended that they were righteous persons, in order to lay hold of some word of his, that they might deliver him to the power and authority of the governor.
042	LUK	020	021	And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou speakest and teachest rightly, and respectest no man’s person, but teachest the way of God in truth:
042	LUK	020	022	Is it lawful for us to pay tribute to Caesar, or not?
042	LUK	020	023	Then he, aware of their crafty design, said unto them, Why tempt ye me?
042	LUK	020	024	Shew me a denarius. Whose image and inscription hath it? And they answering said, Caesar’s.
042	LUK	020	025	Then said he to them, Pay therefore to Caesar the things which are Caesar’s, and to God the things which are God’s.
042	LUK	020	026	And they were unable to lay hold of a single expression of his before the people: and marvelling at his answer, they were silenced.
042	LUK	020	027	Then certain of the Sadducees, who contend that there is no resurrection, asked him,
042	LUK	020	028	saying, Master, Moses wrote for us, If a man’s brother die, having a wife, and he die childless, that his brother should take the wife, and raise up seed for his brother.
042	LUK	020	029	Now there were seven brothers: and the first taking a wife, died childless.
042	LUK	020	030	And the second taking the wife, he also died childless.
042	LUK	020	031	Then the third took her; and also all the seven in like manner: and left no children, and died.
042	LUK	020	032	And last of all died also the woman.
042	LUK	020	033	In the resurrection therefore whose wife of them shall she be? for the seven had her to wife.
042	LUK	020	034	And Jesus in reply said to them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:
042	LUK	020	035	but they who are counted worthy to attain to that world, and the resurrection of the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:
042	LUK	020	036	neither can they die any more: for they are like the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.
042	LUK	020	037	Now that the dead are raised, even Moses intimated at the bush, when he called the Lord, “the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.”
042	LUK	020	038	Now God is not the God of the dead, but of the living: for all live with him.
042	LUK	020	039	Then some of the scribes addressing him said, Master, admirably hast thou spoken!
042	LUK	020	040	And after that they durst not put another question to him.
042	LUK	020	041	Then he spake to them: How say they that the Messiah is the son of David?
042	LUK	020	042	Yet David himself, in the book of Psalms, saith, “The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit down at my right hand,
042	LUK	020	043	until I put thine enemies for a footstool of thy feet.”
042	LUK	020	044	David then calleth him Lord, and how then is he his son?
042	LUK	020	045	And whilst all the people were hearkening, he said to his disciples,
042	LUK	020	046	Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk about in trailing robes, and love salutations in the public places, and the principal seats in the synagogues, and the most honourable couch at suppers;
042	LUK	020	047	who devour the houses of widows, and for a pretext make long prayers: these shall receive a more abundant punishment.
042	LUK	021	001	AND as he looked up, he saw some casting their gifts into the treasury who were rich.
042	LUK	021	002	And he observed also a certain widow, miserably poor, put in there two mites.
042	LUK	021	003	And he said, Of a truth I tell you that this poor widow hath put in more than all they:
042	LUK	021	004	for all they have of their superfluity cast into the oblations for God: but she out of her indigence hath cast in all the substance which she possessed.
042	LUK	021	005	And some of them talking of the temple, how adorned it was with the beautiful stone-work and the dedicated offerings, he said,
042	LUK	021	006	As for these things which ye are gazing upon, the days will come, in which one stone will not be left upon another, that shall not be utterly thrown down.
042	LUK	021	007	And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what is the sign, when these things are ready to come to pass?
042	LUK	021	008	Then he said, Take heed that ye be not deluded: for many will come in my name, saying, I am he; and the period approaches: go not therefore after them.
042	LUK	021	009	But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the conclusion is not immediately.
042	LUK	021	010	Then saith he unto them, Nation shall rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:
042	LUK	021	011	and great earthquakes shall be in different places, and famines, and pestilences; and in the heaven shall be frightful appearances, and mighty signs.
042	LUK	021	012	But before all these things, they will lay hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and to prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name’s sake.
042	LUK	021	013	And it shall afford you an opportunity to bear your testimony.
042	LUK	021	014	Therefore rest satisfied in your hearts, not to premeditate what apology to make:
042	LUK	021	015	for I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall be utterly unable to contradict or resist.
042	LUK	021	016	But ye shall be betrayed even by parents, and brethren, and relations, and friends; and some of you they shall put to death.
042	LUK	021	017	And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake.
042	LUK	021	018	Though a hair of your head shall in nowise perish.
042	LUK	021	019	In your patience possess ye your souls.
042	LUK	021	020	But when ye see Jerusalem, encircled with armies, then know that the desolation of it approaches.
042	LUK	021	021	Then let those who are in Judea fly unto the mountains; and let those who are in the midst of her get far away: and they who are in the countries, let them not enter into her.
042	LUK	021	022	For these are the days of vengeance, when all things which are written shall be fulfilled.
042	LUK	021	023	But wo to those who are big with child, and have infants at their breasts, in those days! for there shall be great distress on the earth, and wrath upon this people.
042	LUK	021	024	And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden under foot of the Gentiles, until the times appointed for the Gentiles shall come to their period.
042	LUK	021	025	And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;
042	LUK	021	026	men terrified to death with fear, and expectation of the calamities coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.
042	LUK	021	027	And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud, with power and great glory.
042	LUK	021	028	And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.
042	LUK	021	029	And he spake a parable unto them, Behold the fig-tree, and all the trees,
042	LUK	021	030	when they now put forth, as soon as ye see it ye know in yourselves that the summer is now near:
042	LUK	021	031	so ye also, when ye see these things come to pass, know that the kingdom of God is at hand.
042	LUK	021	032	Verily I say unto you, That this generation shall in nowise pass away, until all these things come to pass.
042	LUK	021	033	Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall never pass away.
042	LUK	021	034	But take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts should be overloaded with surfeiting and drunkenness, and the anxious cares of life, and that day should come upon you unawares.
042	LUK	021	035	For as a snare shall it come upon all that are settled on the face of the whole earth.
042	LUK	021	036	Watch therefore, praying at every proper opportunity, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things which are ready to come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.
042	LUK	021	037	And during the day he continued teaching in the temple; but at night he went out, and lodged in the mountain called the mount of Olives.
042	LUK	021	038	And all the people came to him early in the morning at the temple, to hear him.
042	LUK	022	001	AND the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the Passover, was at hand.
042	LUK	022	002	And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might destroy him; for they were afraid of the people.
042	LUK	022	003	Then entered Satan into Judas called Iscariot, though he was of the number of the twelve.
042	LUK	022	004	And he went and conversed with the chief priests and the captains, by what means he could betray him unto them.
042	LUK	022	005	And they were glad, and agreed with him to give him a sum of money.
042	LUK	022	006	And he gave them his promise, and sought the favourable opportunity to betray him to them, in the absence of the multitude.
042	LUK	022	007	Then came the day of unleavened bread, on which the passover must be killed.
042	LUK	022	008	And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go, prepare for us the passover, that we may eat it.
042	LUK	022	009	And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare it?
042	LUK	022	010	And he said unto them, Lo! as you are at the entrance of the city, there will a man meet you, carrying a pitcher of water; follow him into the house whither he is going.
042	LUK	022	011	And say to the master of that family, The teacher saith to thee, Where is the dining-room, in which I can eat the passover with my disciples?
042	LUK	022	012	And he will shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.
042	LUK	022	013	And they going away, found it just as he had told them: and they made ready the passover.
042	LUK	022	014	And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.
042	LUK	022	015	And he said unto them, With earnest desire have I longed to eat this passover with you before I suffer:
042	LUK	022	016	for I tell you, that I will no more ever eat of it, until it shall be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	022	017	And taking the cup, after having given thanks, he said, Take this, and divide among yourselves:
042	LUK	022	018	for I say unto you, that I shall no more drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God come.
042	LUK	022	019	And taking a loaf, he gave thanks, and brake, and gave it to them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: do this in remembrance of me.
042	LUK	022	020	And the cup in like manner, after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.
042	LUK	022	021	But lo! the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me at the table.
042	LUK	022	022	And the Son of man indeed goeth, as is decreed: but wo to that man by whom he is betrayed!
042	LUK	022	023	And they began to question among themselves, who it could possibly be of them who should do this thing.
042	LUK	022	024	Now it came to pass, that there was also a contention among them, even which of them should be accounted to be the greatest.
042	LUK	022	025	And he said to them, The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and they who exercise authority over them are called benefactors.
042	LUK	022	026	But ye shall not act thus: but the superior among you, let him be as the junior; and he that presideth, as he that serveth.
042	LUK	022	027	For which is the greater, he that sitteth at table, or he that waits? is not he that sitteth at table? but I am in the midst of you as he that serveth.
042	LUK	022	028	Ye are they who have continued with me during my trials.
042	LUK	022	029	And I appoint you, as my Father hath appointed me, a kingdom;
042	LUK	022	030	that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and be seated on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
042	LUK	022	031	And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, lo! Satan hath earnestly sought you, that he might sift you as wheat:
042	LUK	022	032	but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith may not fail: and when thou art returned, stablish thy brethren.
042	LUK	022	033	Then he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, to prison, and to death!
042	LUK	022	034	And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before thou shalt thrice deny having known me.
042	LUK	022	035	And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, or scrip, or sandals, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.
042	LUK	022	036	Then said he to them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him also take a scrip: and he that hath none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a sword.
042	LUK	022	037	For I tell you, that what hath already been written must be fulfilled in me, namely, “He was numbered with the transgressors:” for the things also concerning me draw to their period.
042	LUK	022	038	Then they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords, and he said to them, It is enough.
042	LUK	022	039	And going out, he went, according to his custom, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.
042	LUK	022	040	And when he came to the spot, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.
042	LUK	022	041	And he withdrew from them about a stone’s cast, and kneeling down, he prayed,
042	LUK	022	042	saying, Father, if thou wilt, remove this cup from me! nevertheless, not my will, but thine, be done.
042	LUK	022	043	And an angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him.
042	LUK	022	044	And being in an agony, he prayed with greater intenseness: and his sweat was as clots of blood falling on the ground.
042	LUK	022	045	And when he rose up from prayer, on coming to his disciples, he found them sleeping from sorrow.
042	LUK	022	046	And he said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise up, and pray, that ye enter not into temptation.
042	LUK	022	047	And while he was yet speaking, behold a multitude, and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and approached Jesus to kiss him.
042	LUK	022	048	Then said Jesus unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?
042	LUK	022	049	Then when they who were about him saw what was ready to happen, they said unto him, Lord, shall we strike with the sword?
042	LUK	022	050	And one of them struck at a servant of the high-priest, and cut off his right ear.
042	LUK	022	051	Then Jesus, addressing them, said, Permit me thus far: and touching his ear, he healed him.
042	LUK	022	052	Then said Jesus to the chief priests and captains of the temple, and to the elders who were come forth against him, Are ye come out as against a robber, with swords and staves?
042	LUK	022	053	When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched out no hands upon me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.
042	LUK	022	054	Then seizing upon him, they led him away, and brought him into the palace of the high-priest. But Peter followed at a distance.
042	LUK	022	055	And as they had lighted a fire in the middle of the hall, and had seated themselves in a company, Peter sat down in the midst of them.
042	LUK	022	056	But a certain maid-servant who sat at the fire, eyeing him, and looking at him stedfastly, said, This man was also with him.
042	LUK	022	057	But he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.
042	LUK	022	058	And after a little while another seeing him, said, Surely thou art one of them. Then said Peter, Man, I am not.
042	LUK	022	059	And at about an hour’s distance, another person strongly asserted, saying, Of a certainty this fellow was also with him: for he too is a Galilean.
042	LUK	022	060	And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And instantly, while he was yet speaking, the cock crew.
042	LUK	022	061	And the Lord, turning round, looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, That before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.
042	LUK	022	062	And Peter going without, wept bitterly.
042	LUK	022	063	And the men who held Jesus insulted him, beating him with rods;
042	LUK	022	064	and blindfolding him, smote him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is he that struck thee?
042	LUK	022	065	And many other things, blaspheming, spake they against him.
042	LUK	022	066	And when the day broke, the elders of the people and the chief priests and scribes assembled, and brought him into their sanhedrim, saying,
042	LUK	022	067	If thou art the Messiah, tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:
042	LUK	022	068	and if I shall ask you any question, ye will neither answer me, nor let me go free.
042	LUK	022	069	Hereafter shall the Son of man sit at the right hand of the power of God.
042	LUK	022	070	Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Yourselves say that I am.
042	LUK	022	071	Then they said, What further need have we of witness? for we have heard it from his own mouth.
042	LUK	023	001	AND the whole multitude of them rising up, led him to Pilate,
042	LUK	023	002	and began to accuse him, saying, We have found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to pay tribute to Caesar; pretending that he himself is the King Messiah.
042	LUK	023	003	Then Pilate interrogated him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said to him, Thou sayest so.
042	LUK	023	004	Then said Pilate unto the chief priests and the multitudes, I find nothing culpable in this man.
042	LUK	023	005	But they were urgent, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching through all Judea, beginning from Galilee even to this place.
042	LUK	023	006	When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilean?
042	LUK	023	007	And when he knew that he came out of Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was himself at Jerusalem in those days.
042	LUK	023	008	Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was vastly delighted: for he had been long desirous to see him, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to see some miracle wrought by him.
042	LUK	023	009	And he put a variety of questions to him; but he made him no reply.
042	LUK	023	010	And the chief priests and the scribes stood up vehemently accusing him.
042	LUK	023	011	Then Herod with his guards treated him with contempt, and in derision clothed him in a splendid robe, and sent him back to Pilate.
042	LUK	023	012	And Pilate and Herod the same day became friends together: for they had previously been at enmity with each other.
042	LUK	023	013	Then Pilate, convoking the chief priests and the rulers and the people,
042	LUK	023	014	said unto them, Ye have brought this man to me, as one who perverteth the people: and lo! on examining him before you, I have found nothing culpable in this man, respecting the charges ye bring against him:
042	LUK	023	015	nor Herod neither: for I referred you to him; and, lo, nothing is done to this man, as if he deserved death.
042	LUK	023	016	I will therefore, after scourging, discharge him.
042	LUK	023	017	(Now he held it necessary to release one to them at the feast.)
042	LUK	023	018	Then the whole multitude set up a cry, saying, Away with this fellow, and release unto us Barabbas!
042	LUK	023	019	(who for a certain sedition raised in the city, and for murder, had been cast into prison.)
042	LUK	023	020	Again therefore Pilate called out to them, desirous to see Jesus at liberty.
042	LUK	023	021	But they clamoured the more, saying, Crucify, crucify him.
042	LUK	023	022	Then the third time he said to them, What evil hath this man done? I have found nothing deserving death in him: I will therefore, after scourging, discharge him.
042	LUK	023	023	But they were instant with the most clamorous vociferations, soliciting that he might be crucified. And their clamours, and those of the chief priests, bore him down.
042	LUK	023	024	Then Pilate decreed that their petition should be granted.
042	LUK	023	025	Then released he to them him who for sedition and murder had been cast into prison; but he gave up Jesus to their will.
042	LUK	023	026	And as they led him out, laying hold on one Simon, a Cyrenian, who was coming from the country, they laid on him the cross, to carry after Jesus.
042	LUK	023	027	And a great multitude of the people and of women followed him, who also beat their breasts and lamented him bitterly.
042	LUK	023	028	But Jesus turning to them, said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but for yourselves, and for your children.
042	LUK	023	029	For, behold, the days are coming, in which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs which have not borne, and the breasts which never suckled.
042	LUK	023	030	Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us! and to the hills, Cover us!
042	LUK	023	031	For if they do all these things with the green wood, what will be done with the dry?
042	LUK	023	032	Now there were two other persons, malefactors, led out with him to be executed.
042	LUK	023	033	And when they came to a place called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, the one on the right hand, and the other on the left.
042	LUK	023	034	And Jesus said, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. Then dividing his garments, they cast the lot.
042	LUK	023	035	And the people stood looking on. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if this fellow is the Messiah, the elect of God.
042	LUK	023	036	And the soldiers also insulted him, coming and offering him vinegar,
042	LUK	023	037	and saying, if thou art the King of the Jews, save thyself.
042	LUK	023	038	And there was an inscription written over him in Greek, Roman, and Hebrew characters, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
042	LUK	023	039	Then one of the suspended malefactors blasphemed him, saying, If thou art the Messiah, save thyself and us.
042	LUK	023	040	But the other addressing him, rebuked him, saying, Hast thou no fear of God, when thou art under the same condemnation?
042	LUK	023	041	And we indeed justly, for we receive deserved punishment for the crimes we have committed: but this man hath done nothing amiss.
042	LUK	023	042	And he said to Jesus, Remember me, Lord, when thou comest in thy kingdom.
042	LUK	023	043	And Jesus said to him. Verily I say unto thee, To-day thou shalt be with me in paradise.
042	LUK	023	044	And it was about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.
042	LUK	023	045	And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.
042	LUK	023	046	And Jesus crying with a loud voice, said, Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit: and having said this, he expired.
042	LUK	023	047	And the centurion observing what had come to pass, glorified God, saying, Verily this man was a righteous person.
042	LUK	023	048	And all the multitudes who had come together for this spectacle, when they saw the things which were done, beating their breasts, returned.
042	LUK	023	049	And all his acquaintance stood afar off, and the women which followed him from Galilee, beholding these things.
042	LUK	023	050	And lo! a man named Joseph, being a member of the council, a good man, and a just;
042	LUK	023	051	(who had not given his assent to their determination and deed; ) being of Arimathea, a city of the Jews: who himself also expected the coming of the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	023	052	He went in to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.
042	LUK	023	053	And taking it down from the cross, he wrapped it in linen cloth, and laid it in a sepulchre hewn out of a rock, where none had ever yet lain.
042	LUK	023	054	And that was the preparation-day, and the sabbath’s twilight was approaching.
042	LUK	023	055	Then the women also, his attendants, who had followed him out of Galilee, observed the sepulchre, and how his corpse was laid out.
042	LUK	023	056	And returning, they made preparation of aromatics and unguents; and they rested the sabbath-day, according to the commandment.
042	LUK	024	001	NOW on the first day of the week, at the earliest dawn of day, they came to the sepulchre, bringing the aromatics which they had prepared, and certain others with them.
042	LUK	024	002	And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.
042	LUK	024	003	And on entering, found not the body of the Lord Jesus.
042	LUK	024	004	And it came to pass, as they were in the greatest perplexity concerning this matter, then behold, two men stood by them in refulgent garments:
042	LUK	024	005	and when they were exceedingly terrified, and inclined their face to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?
042	LUK	024	006	he is not here; he is risen: remember how he spoke to you, while he was yet in Galilee,
042	LUK	024	007	saying, That the Son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.
042	LUK	024	008	And they remembered his declarations,
042	LUK	024	009	and returning from the sepulchre, told all these things to the eleven, and to the rest.
042	LUK	024	010	Now there were Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and the other women who were with them, that told these things to the apostles.
042	LUK	024	011	And their declarations seemed in their view as a mere fancy, and they gave them no credence.
042	LUK	024	012	Then Peter rising up, ran off to the sepulchre, and leaning forward saw the linen clothes laid separately, and went away wondering in himself what was become of him.
042	LUK	024	013	And behold, two of them were going the same day to a village, distant about sixty furlongs from Jerusalem, called Emmaus.
042	LUK	024	014	And they were conversing with each other, concerning all those things which had happened.
042	LUK	024	015	And it came to pass, as they were conversing together, and talking the matter over, even Jesus himself drew near, and walked on with them.
042	LUK	024	016	But their eyes were under a restraint, that they might not discover him.
042	LUK	024	017	And he said unto them, What are these discourses that ye interchange among you, as ye are walking, and bear such a face of dejection?
042	LUK	024	018	Then one of them, named Cleopas, answering said, Art thou the only sojourner at Jerusalem, who hath not known the singular events of those days?
042	LUK	024	019	And he said to them, Of what sort? and they said to him, Those which relate to Jesus the Nazarean, who was a man, a prophet, mighty in word and deed before God and all the people:
042	LUK	024	020	and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up to a sentence of death, and crucified him.
042	LUK	024	021	But we had entertained hopes that this was the person who should have redeemed Israel: and ah! besides all these things, to-day concludes that third day since these things were done.
042	LUK	024	022	And indeed, certain women belonging to us exceedingly amazed us who were very early at the sepulchre;
042	LUK	024	023	and not finding his body, came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, who told them that he was alive.
042	LUK	024	024	And some of those who were with us went to the sepulchre, and found every thing just as the women had said: but him they did not see.
042	LUK	024	025	And he said unto them, O ye void of understanding, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!
042	LUK	024	026	Ought not the Messiah to suffer these things, and to enter into his glory?
042	LUK	024	027	And beginning from Moses and all the prophets, he explained to them in all the scriptures, the things relating to himself.
042	LUK	024	028	And they drew nigh to the village, whither they were going: and he was proceeding on, as if going farther.
042	LUK	024	029	And they warmly pressed him, saying, Stay with us: for the evening draws on, and the day declines. And he went in to stay with them.
042	LUK	024	030	And it came to pass, when he was sitting down at table with them, taking up a loaf, he blessed it, and breaking, distributed it to them.
042	LUK	024	031	Then their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he became invisible to them.
042	LUK	024	032	And they said to each other, Did not our hearts burn within us, as he talked with us on the road, and as he distinctly opened to us the scriptures?
042	LUK	024	033	And rising up the same hour, they returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven and those who were with them crowded together,
042	LUK	024	034	saying, The Lord is risen assuredly, and hath appeared to Simon.
042	LUK	024	035	Then these recounted what had passed on the road, and how he was known to them by the breaking of the bread.
042	LUK	024	036	While they were relating these things, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you!
042	LUK	024	037	But terrified and affrighted, they thought they saw a spirit.
042	LUK	024	038	And he said to them, Why are ye under such agitation of mind? and why do reasonings arise in your hearts?
042	LUK	024	039	look upon my hands and my feet, that it is my very self: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.
042	LUK	024	040	And thus speaking, he exposed to them his hands and his feet.
042	LUK	024	041	But when they still could not credit it for joy, and marvelled, he said unto them, Have ye here any thing eatable?
042	LUK	024	042	Then they gave him a part of a broiled fish, and a piece of honey-comb.
042	LUK	024	043	And receiving it, he did eat in their presence.
042	LUK	024	044	And said unto them, These are the sayings which I spake unto you, when I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning me.
042	LUK	024	045	Then opened he thoroughly their understanding, that they should understand the scriptures,
042	LUK	024	046	and said to them, That thus it is written, and thus must the Messiah suffer, and rise again from the dead the third day
042	LUK	024	047	and that repentance and remission of sin should be preached in his name unto all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.
042	LUK	024	048	And ye are the witnesses of these things.
042	LUK	024	049	And, behold, I send unto you the promise of my Father: but sit ye down in the city of Jerusalem, until ye shall be endued with power from on high.
042	LUK	024	050	And he led them without the city as far as Bethany, and lifting up his hands he blessed them.
042	LUK	024	051	And it came to pass, as he pronounced the benediction upon them, he was parted from them, and taken up into heaven.
042	LUK	024	052	And they, after paying him their adorations, returned to Jerusalem with vast joy:
042	LUK	024	053	and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.

# BOOK	043	JOH	John	John
043	JOH	001	001	IN the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
043	JOH	001	002	He was in the beginning with God.
043	JOH	001	003	All things were made by him; and without him was not one thing made that was made.
043	JOH	001	004	In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
043	JOH	001	005	And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness did not comprehend it.
043	JOH	001	006	A man was sent from God, whose name was John.
043	JOH	001	007	He came for a witness, that he might bear testimony concerning the Light, that all men through him might believe.
043	JOH	001	008	He was not the Light, but sent that he should bear testimony concerning the Light.
043	JOH	001	009	He was that true Light, which illumines every man by his coming into the world.
043	JOH	001	010	He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.
043	JOH	001	011	He came unto his peculiar people, and his peculiar people did not receive him.
043	JOH	001	012	But as many as did receive him, on them he bestowed authority to become children of God, even on those who believe on his name:
043	JOH	001	013	who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
043	JOH	001	014	And the Word became incarnate, and tabernacled with us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, ) full of grace and truth.
043	JOH	001	015	John bore witness concerning him, and cried, saying, This is he of whom I said, He that is coming after me, is before me: because before me he was.
043	JOH	001	016	And from his plenitude we all have received, even grace corresponding with his grace.
043	JOH	001	017	For the law was given by Moses, but the grace and the reality came by Jesus Christ.
043	JOH	001	018	No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath thoroughly described him.
043	JOH	001	019	And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent from Jerusalem priests and Levites, that they should question him, Who art thou?
043	JOH	001	020	And he confessed, and denied it not; but acknowledged, I am not the Messiah.
043	JOH	001	021	And they asked him, What then? art thou Elias? and he said, I am not. Art thou that prophet? and he answered, No.
043	JOH	001	022	Then said they to him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to those who sent us: What description givest thou of thyself?
043	JOH	001	023	He said, I am a voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way for the Lord, as said the prophet Isaiah.
043	JOH	001	024	And they who were sent, were of the Pharisees.
043	JOH	001	025	And they questioned him, and said to him, Why then dost thou baptise, if thou be not the Messiah, nor Elias, nor that prophet?
043	JOH	001	026	John answered them, saying, I baptise with water: but in the midst of you hath stood a person, whom ye have not known;
043	JOH	001	027	it is he, though coming after me, who was before me, the thong of whole sandal I am not worthy to untie.
043	JOH	001	028	These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptising.
043	JOH	001	029	The next day John seeth Jesus coming to him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world,
043	JOH	001	030	This is he of whom I spake, After me cometh a man who was before me: for before me he existed.
043	JOH	001	031	And I knew him not: though that he might be manifested to Israel, therefore am I come baptising with water.
043	JOH	001	032	And John bore witness, saying, I saw the Spirit descending as a dove from heaven, and it rested upon him.
043	JOH	001	033	And I did not know him: but he that sent me baptising with water, he said to me, Upon whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending as a dove, and resting upon him, that is he who baptiseth with the Holy Ghost.
043	JOH	001	034	And I have seen it, and have borne testimony that this is the Son of God.
043	JOH	001	035	On the morrow John was again standing with two of his disciples;
043	JOH	001	036	and looking upon Jesus as he walked by, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!
043	JOH	001	037	And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.
043	JOH	001	038	Then Jesus turned about, and seeing them following, saith to them, What are ye seeking? They said unto him, Rabbi (which signifies, when translated, Master), where is thy abode?
043	JOH	001	039	He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he abode, and continued with him that day: and it was about the tenth hour.
043	JOH	001	040	One of the two, who had heard from John mention of Jesus, and had followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.
043	JOH	001	041	He first finds his own brother Simon, and saith to him, We have found the Messiah (which is, being translated, the Christ).
043	JOH	001	042	And he brought him to Jesus. Then Jesus looking on him, said, Thou art Simon the son of Jonas: thou shalt be called Cephas, which, interpreted in Greek, is Petros, a Rock.
043	JOH	001	043	The next day Jesus resolved to go into Galilee, and he findeth Philip, and saith to him, Follow me.
043	JOH	001	044	Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
043	JOH	001	045	Philip findeth Nathaniel, and saith to him, We have found him whom Moses in the law has described, and the prophets, Jesus the son of Joseph, who is of Nazareth.
043	JOH	001	046	And Nathaniel said to him, Can any thing good come out of Nazareth? Philip saith to him, Come and see.
043	JOH	001	047	Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite in reality, in whom there is no guile!
043	JOH	001	048	Nathaniel saith unto him, From whence canst thou know me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee.
043	JOH	001	049	Nathaniel answered and said to him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the king of Israel.
043	JOH	001	050	Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said to thee, I saw thee under the fig-tree, dost thou believe? thou shalt see greater things than these.
043	JOH	001	051	And he saith to him, Verily, verily, I tell you, From henceforth ye shall see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.
043	JOH	002	001	AND on the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:
043	JOH	002	002	So Jesus also, and his disciples, were invited to the marriage.
043	JOH	002	003	And the wine being exhausted, the mother of Jesus saith to him, They have no more wine.
043	JOH	002	004	Jesus saith unto her, What is that to me and thee, woman? my hour is not yet come.
043	JOH	002	005	His mother saith to the waiters, Whatsoever he orders you, do it.
043	JOH	002	006	Now there stood there six large stone jars, for the customary purifying ablution of the Jews, containing two or three baths each.
043	JOH	002	007	Jesus saith to them, Fill these jars with water. And they filled them to the brim.
043	JOH	002	008	And he said unto them, Draw out now, and carry to the president of the table. So they carried it.
043	JOH	002	009	And when the president of the table had tasted the water become wine, and knew not whence it came: (but the waiters knew, who drew the water; ) the president of the table called the bridegroom,
043	JOH	002	010	and saith to him, Every man at first produces the good wine; and after men have drunk plentifully, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept back the good wine until now.
043	JOH	002	011	This beginning of miracles Jesus wrought in Cana of Galilee, and displayed his glory; and his disciples believed on him.
043	JOH	002	012	After this he went down to Capernaum, he and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and he continued there not many days.
043	JOH	002	013	And the passover of the Jews was nigh, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
043	JOH	002	014	And he found in the temple those who sold oxen, and sheep, and doves, and the moneychangers seated:
043	JOH	002	015	and having made a whip of cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and scattered the money of the exchangers, and overturned the tables;
043	JOH	002	016	and said to those who sold doves, Take these hence; make not my Father’s house a house of merchandise.
043	JOH	002	017	Then the disciples remembered that it was written, “The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.”
043	JOH	002	018	The Jews then addressed him, and said to him, What miracle shewest thou, seeing thou actest thus?
043	JOH	002	019	Jesus answered and said to them, Pull down this temple, and in three days I will rear it up again.
043	JOH	002	020	Then said the Jews, This temple has been forty-six years in building, and canst thou rear it up in three days?
043	JOH	002	021	Now he had spoken with reference to the temple of his own body.
043	JOH	002	022	When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had spoken thus unto them; and they believed the scriptures, and the word which Jesus had spoken.
043	JOH	002	023	Now while he was at Jerusalem at the passover, during the feast, many believed on his name, when they beheld the miracles which he did.
043	JOH	002	024	But Jesus himself did not trust himself to them, because he knew them all,
043	JOH	002	025	and because he had no need that any man should testify respecting man; for he knew what was in man.
043	JOH	003	001	NOW there was a man of the Pharisees, whose name was Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:
043	JOH	003	002	this man came to Jesus in the night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles which thou dost, unless God be with him.
043	JOH	003	003	Jesus answered and said to him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
043	JOH	003	004	Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?
043	JOH	003	005	Jesus replied, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
043	JOH	003	006	That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
043	JOH	003	007	Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.
043	JOH	003	008	The wind bloweth where it will, and thou hearest the sound of it, but knowest not from whence it cometh, nor whither it goeth: just so is every one who is born of the Spirit.
043	JOH	003	009	Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?
043	JOH	003	010	Jesus answered and said to him, Art thou a teacher of Israel, and knowest not these things?
043	JOH	003	011	Verily, verity, I tell thee, That what we know we speak, and what we have seen we affirm; and ye receive not our testimony.
043	JOH	003	012	If I have told you of earthly things, and ye believe not, how will you believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?
043	JOH	003	013	Though no man hath ascended into heaven, except he that descended from heaven, that Son of man the I am in heaven.
043	JOH	003	014	And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, in like manner must the Son of man be lifted up:
043	JOH	003	015	that every one who believeth on him may not perish, but have life eternal.
043	JOH	003	016	For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that every one who believeth in him should not perish, but have life eternal.
043	JOH	003	017	For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world by him might be saved.
043	JOH	003	018	He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is already under condemnation, because he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God.
043	JOH	003	019	Now this is the condemnation, that the light is come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light, because their deeds were evil.
043	JOH	003	020	For every one whose practices are foul hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, that his actions may not be brought to conviction.
043	JOH	003	021	But he who practices the truth, cometh to the light, that his actions may be evident, as being done for God.
043	JOH	003	022	After these things Jesus and his disciples went into the land of Judea; and there he abode with them, and baptised.
043	JOH	003	023	Now John also was baptising at Enon, near to Salem, for there were many streams of water there: and they came, and were baptised.
043	JOH	003	024	For as yet John was not cast into prison.
043	JOH	003	025	Then a dispute arose between the disciples of John and the Jews with regard to purification.
043	JOH	003	026	And they came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou gavest testimony, lo! this man baptiseth, and all men come to him.
043	JOH	003	027	John answered and said, A man cannot assume any thing, except it be given him from heaven.
043	JOH	003	028	Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Messiah, but that I am sent before him.
043	JOH	003	029	It is the bridegroom, who possesses the bride: and the friend of the bridegroom, standing by and hearing him, rejoiceth exceedingly at the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.
043	JOH	003	030	He must grow great, but I diminutive.
043	JOH	003	031	He that cometh from above is above all: he whose origin is from earth is of the earth, and speaketh of the earth: he who cometh from heaven is above all.
043	JOH	003	032	And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; though no man receiveth his testimony.
043	JOH	003	033	He that receiveth his testimony hath avouched that God is true.
043	JOH	003	034	For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God hath not given the Spirit by measure unto him.
043	JOH	003	035	The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.
043	JOH	003	036	He that believeth on the Son hath life eternal: and he that believeth not on the Son shall not see life: but the wrath of God abideth upon him.
043	JOH	004	001	AS soon then as the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptised more disciples than John
043	JOH	004	002	(though Jesus himself did not baptise, but his disciples),
043	JOH	004	003	he left Judea, and went again into Galilee.
043	JOH	004	004	Now he must necessarily pass through Samaria.
043	JOH	004	005	Then he cometh to a city of Samaria, called Sichar, near the spot of ground which Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
043	JOH	004	006	And Jacob’s well was there. Therefore Jesus, weary with his journey, e’en sat himself down on the well: it was about the sixth hour.
043	JOH	004	007	A woman of Samaria comes to draw water: Jesus saith to her, Give me to drink.
043	JOH	004	008	(For his disciples were gone into the city to buy provisions.)
043	JOH	004	009	The Samaritan woman therefore saith to him, How canst thou, a Jew, ask of me, who am a Samaritan woman, to drink? for Jews avoid all intercourse with Samaritans.
043	JOH	004	010	Jesus answered and said to her, If thou hadst known the gift of God, and who he is that speaketh to thee, thou wouldest have requested him, and he would have given thee life-giving water.
043	JOH	004	011	The woman saith unto him, Thou hast no bucket, and the well is deep: whence then canst thou have this water that giveth life?
043	JOH	004	012	Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, and his children, and his cattle?
043	JOH	004	013	Jesus answered and said unto her, Every one who drinketh of this water shall thirst again:
043	JOH	004	014	but whosoever shall drink of the water which I shall give him, he shall no more thirst to eternity; but the water which I will give him, shall be in him a fountain of water springing up to life eternal.
043	JOH	004	015	The woman saith to him, Sir, give me this water, that I may no more thirst, nor come hither to draw.
043	JOH	004	016	Jesus saith to her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.
043	JOH	004	017	The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus saith to her, Thou hast spoken right, that thou hast no husband:
043	JOH	004	018	for thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in this thou hast spoken true.
043	JOH	004	019	The woman saith to him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.
043	JOH	004	020	Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye affirm, That the place where we ought to worship is at Jerusalem.
043	JOH	004	021	Jesus saith to her, Woman, believe me, that the hour approaches, when ye shall worship the Father neither in this mountain, nor at Jerusalem.
043	JOH	004	022	Ye worship ye know not what: we worship what we do know: for salvation cometh from the Jews.
043	JOH	004	023	But the hour is coming, yea, is now come, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such worshippers of him.
043	JOH	004	024	God is a Spirit: and they who worship him, must worship him in spirit and in truth.
043	JOH	004	025	The woman saith, I know that Messiah is coming (who is called Christ): when he cometh, he will inform us of all things.
043	JOH	004	026	Jesus saith unto her, I that am speaking to thee am he.
043	JOH	004	027	And upon this came his disciples, and wondered that he talked with the woman: yet no one said, What art thou seeking? or, Why art thou talking with her?
043	JOH	004	028	Then the woman left her pitcher, and went into the city, and said to the men,
043	JOH	004	029	Come with me; behold a man, who told me all things that I ever did: is not this the Messiah?
043	JOH	004	030	Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.
043	JOH	004	031	In the mean time his disciples invited him, saying, Rabbi, eat.
043	JOH	004	032	But he said to them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.
043	JOH	004	033	Then said his disciples to each other, Hath any person brought him ought to eat?
043	JOH	004	034	Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.
043	JOH	004	035	Do ye not say, That yet there are four months, and then the harvest cometh? behold, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and look upon the fields; for they are now white for harvest.
043	JOH	004	036	And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.
043	JOH	004	037	For herein is the saying true, That one soweth and another reapeth.
043	JOH	004	038	I have sent you to reap that on which ye have bestowed no labour: others have laboured, and ye have entered into their labour.
043	JOH	004	039	Now many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him, on the report of the woman, who said, That he told me all things I ever had done.
043	JOH	004	040	So on this the Samaritans came to him, and besought him to abide with them: and he tarried there two days.
043	JOH	004	041	And many more believed because of his own word;
043	JOH	004	042	and said to the woman, Now we believe, not merely on account of thy relation: for we ourselves have heard, and know that this is of a certainty the Saviour of the world, the Messiah.
043	JOH	004	043	Then after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.
043	JOH	004	044	For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.
043	JOH	004	045	When therefore he was come into Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, having seen all the things which he did at the feast: for they also had gone to the feast.
043	JOH	004	046	Then came Jesus again to Cana of Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And there was a certain attendant on the king, whose son was sick at Capernaum.
043	JOH	004	047	This person having heard that Jesus was come out of Judea into Galilee, went to him, that he might come down, and cure his son: for he was at the point of death.
043	JOH	004	048	Then said Jesus unto him, Unless ye see miracles and wonders, ye will not believe.
043	JOH	004	049	The courtier said to him, Sir, come down before my child is dead.
043	JOH	004	050	Jesus saith to him, Go home; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word which Jesus had spoken, and went home.
043	JOH	004	051	And as he was now going down home, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son is recovered!
043	JOH	004	052	Then inquired he of them the hour at which he began to amend? and they told him, It was yesterday, at the seventh hour, when the fever left him.
043	JOH	004	053	Then the father knew that it was the very hour when Jesus said, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole family.
043	JOH	004	054	This is again a second miracle which Jesus did, when he came from Judea into Galilee.
043	JOH	005	001	AFTER these things there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
043	JOH	005	002	Now there is at Jerusalem near the sheep-market a pool, called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porticos.
043	JOH	005	003	In these lay a vast multitude of infirm persons, blind, lame, withered, waiting the motion of the water.
043	JOH	005	004	For occasionally an angel descended into the pool, and put the water into commotion: he therefore who first stepped in after the commotion of the water became well, under whatever complaint he had laboured.
043	JOH	005	005	And there was a certain man there, who had a complaint of thirty years standing.
043	JOH	005	006	Jesus seeing him laid there, and knowing that he had been so for a long while, saith to him, Wilt thou be made sound?
043	JOH	005	007	The infirm man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is disturbed, to cast me into the pool: but when I am coming, another goeth down before me.
043	JOH	005	008	Jesus saith to him, Arise, take up thy bed, and walk.
043	JOH	005	009	And instantly the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked away: and that day was the sabbath.
043	JOH	005	010	The Jews therefore said to him that was cured, It is the sabbath: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.
043	JOH	005	011	He answered them, He that made me whole, the same person said to me, Take up thy bed, and walk.
043	JOH	005	012	Then they asked him, Who is the man that said to thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?
043	JOH	005	013	Now he that was cured knew not who he was: for Jesus had slipped away, a crowd being on the spot.
043	JOH	005	014	After these things Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Take care; thou art made whole: sin no more, lest something worse befall thee.
043	JOH	005	015	The man went, and informed the Jews, that it was Jesus who had made him whole.
043	JOH	005	016	And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to kill him, because he had done these things on the sabbath-day.
043	JOH	005	017	Then Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.
043	JOH	005	018	Therefore sought they the more to kill him, because he had not only broken the sabbath, but called God his own Father, setting himself on an equality with God.
043	JOH	005	019	Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing by himself, except what he hath seen the Father do: for whatsoever things he doeth, the same and in the same manner doth the Son.
043	JOH	005	020	For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things which he himself doeth: and greater works than these will he shew him, that ye may wonder.
043	JOH	005	021	For as the Father raiseth the dead, and quickeneth them; so also doth the Son quicken whom he pleases.
043	JOH	005	022	For the Father never judgeth any man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son:
043	JOH	005	023	in order that all may honour the Son, just as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son, doth not honour the Father who sent him.
043	JOH	005	024	Verily, verily, I say unto you, That he that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment; but is passed from death into life.
043	JOH	005	025	Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, yea, it is now, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.
043	JOH	005	026	For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son also to have life in himself;
043	JOH	005	027	and hath given him authority also to execute judgment, because he is the Son of man.
043	JOH	005	028	Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in which all who are in the graves shall hear his voice,
043	JOH	005	029	and they shall come forth; they who have done good actions to the resurrection of life; and they who have been guilty of foul practices, to the resurrection of damnation.
043	JOH	005	030	I am not able to perform any thing by myself: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; for I seek not my own will, but the will of my Father who sent me.
043	JOH	005	031	If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.
043	JOH	005	032	There is another who beareth witness of me, and I know that his witness is true which he witnesseth concerning me.
043	JOH	005	033	Ye sent to John, and he bore testimony to the truth.
043	JOH	005	034	But I receive not testimony from man: but I speak these things, that ye may believe.
043	JOH	005	035	He was a lamp glowing and luminous: and ye were pleased for a time to exult in his light.
043	JOH	005	036	But I have a testimony greater than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me that I should fulfil them, these very works which I am doing, they bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.
043	JOH	005	037	And the Father who sent me, himself hath borne witness concerning me. Ye have neither at any time heard his voice, nor seen his form.
043	JOH	005	038	And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.
043	JOH	005	039	Search the scriptures; for ye suppose in them ye have eternal life: and these are they which testify of me.
043	JOH	005	040	And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.
043	JOH	005	041	I receive not glory from men.
043	JOH	005	042	But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.
043	JOH	005	043	I have come in my Father’s name, and ye receive me not: if another come in his own name, him ye will receive.
043	JOH	005	044	How can ye believe, who receiving honour one from another, seek not the honour which cometh from God alone?
043	JOH	005	045	Do not suppose that I shall accuse you to my Father: there is one who is accusing you, even Moses, on whom ye place your hope.
043	JOH	005	046	For if ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for of me did he write.
043	JOH	005	047	But if ye believe not his writings, how will ye believe my words?
043	JOH	006	001	AFTER these things Jesus went beyond the sea of Galilee, that is of Tiberias.
043	JOH	006	002	And a vast multitude followed him, because they saw the miracles which he performed on those who were diseased.
043	JOH	006	003	Then Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat down with his disciple.
043	JOH	006	004	And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.
043	JOH	006	005	Then Jesus lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a vast concourse of people was come to him, said to Philip, Whence shall we buy loaves, that these may eat?
043	JOH	006	006	And this he said to try him: for himself knew what he would do.
043	JOH	006	007	Philip answered him, Two hundred denarii spent in bread would not procure a sufficiency for them, that every one of them might have a morsel.
043	JOH	006	008	One of his disciples saith to him, (Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, )
043	JOH	006	009	There is a little lad here, who hath five barley-loaves, and two small fishes: but these, what are they among so many?
043	JOH	006	010	Then said Jesus, Make the men sit down. For there was plenty of grass on the spot. Therefore the men sat down, in number about five thousand.
043	JOH	006	011	And Jesus took the loaves; and giving thanks, gave to the disciples, and the disciples to those who were sat down; and in the same manner of the fishes, as much as they chose.
043	JOH	006	012	And when they had made a hearty meal, he saith to his disciples, Gather up the broken bits which are left, that not a morsel be wasted.
043	JOH	006	013	Then they collected them, and filled twelve baskets with fragments out of the five barley-loaves, which were more than enough for those who had eaten.
043	JOH	006	014	When therefore the men saw the miracle which Jesus had done, they said, This is of a certainty that prophet which is to come into the world.
043	JOH	006	015	Then Jesus, knowing their intention to come and to seize him by force, in order to make him king, retired again into the mountain by himself alone.
043	JOH	006	016	So when evening was now come, his disciples went down to the sea-side,
043	JOH	006	017	and embarking on a vessel were coming across the sea to Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.
043	JOH	006	018	And the sea was greatly agitated by a tempestuous wind that blew.
043	JOH	006	019	Having rowed therefore about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they saw Jesus walking on the sea, and coming near the vessel, and they were affrighted.
043	JOH	006	020	But he saith to them, It is I; be not afraid.
043	JOH	006	021	Then they desired to take him into the vessel: and instantly the vessel was at the land whither they were going.
043	JOH	006	022	The next day the multitude who stayed on the other side of the sea, when they saw that there was no little vessel there, except the one into which his disciples went, and that Jesus went not with his disciples in the vessel, but that his disciples went away alone;
043	JOH	006	023	(but now little vessels had come from Tiberias near to the spot where they had eaten bread, after the Lord had given thanks: )
043	JOH	006	024	then when the multitude saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they also went into the vessels, and came to Capernaum, in search of Jesus.
043	JOH	006	025	And when they found him on the other side the sea, they said to him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?
043	JOH	006	026	Jesus replied to them and said, Ye seek me, not because ye have seen the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.
043	JOH	006	027	Labour not for the meat which is perishable, but for that meat which endureth unto life eternal, which the Son of man will give you: for him hath the Father sealed, even God.
043	JOH	006	028	Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we may work the works of God?
043	JOH	006	029	Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye should believe on him whom he hath sent.
043	JOH	006	030	Then said they to him, What miracle therefore dost thou, that we may see and believe thee? what dost thou work?
043	JOH	006	031	Our fathers did eat manna in the wilderness; as it is written, “He gave them bread from heaven to eat.”
043	JOH	006	032	Then said Jesus unto them, Verily, verily, I tell you, It was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the real bread from heaven.
043	JOH	006	033	For he that cometh down from heaven, and giveth life to the world, is the bread of God.
043	JOH	006	034	Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.
043	JOH	006	035	Then said Jesus to them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst more.
043	JOH	006	036	But I have told you, That though ye have seen me, yet ye have not believed.
043	JOH	006	037	Every individual which the Father giveth me will come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in nowise cast out.
043	JOH	006	038	For I came down from heaven, not with a view to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me.
043	JOH	006	039	Now this is the will of the Father who sent me, That every thing which he hath given me I should not be deprived of it, but raise it up at the last day.
043	JOH	006	040	And this is the will of him that sent me, That every one who seeth the Son, and believeth on him, should have life eternal: and I will raise him up at the last day.
043	JOH	006	041	Then the Jews murmured against him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.
043	JOH	006	042	And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how then saith this man, That I came down from heaven?
043	JOH	006	043	Jesus answered and said to them, Murmur not among yourselves.
043	JOH	006	044	No man can come to me, except the Father who hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.
043	JOH	006	045	It is written in the prophets, And “they shall all be taught of God.” Every one therefore who heareth from the Father, and learneth, cometh to me.
043	JOH	006	046	Not that any man hath seen the Father, except he that is with God, he hath seen the Father.
043	JOH	006	047	Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.
043	JOH	006	048	I am the bread of life.
043	JOH	006	049	Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and they are dead.
043	JOH	006	050	This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that any person may eat of it, and never die.
043	JOH	006	051	I am the bread that giveth life, which came down from heaven: if any person eat of this bread, he shall live to eternity; and the bread indeed which I shall give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.
043	JOH	006	052	Then the Jews contended with each other, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?
043	JOH	006	053	Jesus therefore said to them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in yourselves.
043	JOH	006	054	He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath life eternal: and I will raise him up at the last day.
043	JOH	006	055	For my flesh truly is meat, and my blood truly is drink.
043	JOH	006	056	He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, abideth in me, and I in him.
043	JOH	006	057	As the life-giving Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father; so he that eateth me, the same shall live by me.
043	JOH	006	058	This is the bread which came down from heaven, not as the manna your fathers did eat, and died: he that eateth this bread shall live to eternity.
043	JOH	006	059	These things he spake in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
043	JOH	006	060	Many therefore of his disciples, who heard him, said, Difficult is this discourse, who is able to fathom it?
043	JOH	006	061	Then Jesus, conscious in himself that his disciples murmured concerning this discourse, said unto them, Doth this stumble you?
043	JOH	006	062	What then if ye see the Son of man ascending where he was formerly?
043	JOH	006	063	The Spirit is the life-giving power; the flesh contributeth nothing: the declarations which I make to you, they are spirit, and they are life.
043	JOH	006	064	But there are some of you who do not believe. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and who the person was that should betray him.
043	JOH	006	065	And he said, Therefore have I informed you, That no man can come to me, except it be given him of my Father.
043	JOH	006	066	From that discourse many of his disciples went away back, and no more followed him about.
043	JOH	006	067	Then said Jesus to the twelve, Will ye also go away?
043	JOH	006	068	Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, unto whom shall we go from thee? thou hast the words of eternal life.
043	JOH	006	069	And we have believed and known that thou art the Messiah, the Son of the living God.
043	JOH	006	070	Jesus answered them, Have I not chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?
043	JOH	006	071	Now he spake of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon: for this man was ready to betray him, though he was one of the twelve.
043	JOH	007	001	AND Jesus after these things travelled about in Galilee: for he would not go about in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.
043	JOH	007	002	And a feast of the Jews was nigh, the feast of tabernacles.
043	JOH	007	003	Then said his disciples to him, Depart hence, and go into Judea, that thy disciples also may see thy works which thou doest.
043	JOH	007	004	For no man doeth any thing in secret, yet seeketh himself to appear publicly: if thou doest these things, exhibit thyself to the world.
043	JOH	007	005	For even his own brethren did not believe on him.
043	JOH	007	006	Jesus therefore saith to them, My proper time is not yet come: but your time is always ready.
043	JOH	007	007	The world cannot hate you, but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that its deeds are evil.
043	JOH	007	008	Go ye up to this feast: for I am not yet going up to this feast, because my fixed time is not yet arrived.
043	JOH	007	009	Thus speaking to them then, he continued in Galilee.
043	JOH	007	010	But as soon as his disciples were gone up, then went he also himself up to the feast: not in public, but as in concealment.
043	JOH	007	011	The Jews then sought for him at the feast, and said, Where is he?
043	JOH	007	012	And there was a great murmur concerning him among the multitude: some said, Surely he is a good man: others said, No; he only deceiveth the people.
043	JOH	007	013	Yet no person spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.
043	JOH	007	014	But now at the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.
043	JOH	007	015	And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man the scriptures, not being a scholar?
043	JOH	007	016	Jesus answered them and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.
043	JOH	007	017	If any man will do his will, he shall know respecting the doctrine, whether it is of God, or whether I speak from myself.
043	JOH	007	018	He that speaketh from himself, seeks his own individual honour: but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, he is true, and iniquity in him there is none.
043	JOH	007	019	Hath not Moses given you the law, yet none of you practises the law? Why do ye seek to kill me?
043	JOH	007	020	The multitude answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who is seeking to kill thee?
043	JOH	007	021	Jesus answered and said unto them, I have performed one work, and ye all marvel.
043	JOH	007	022	Because Moses ordered you circumcision; (not that it comes from Moses, but from our ancestors; ) so ye circumcise a man on the sabbath-day.
043	JOH	007	023	If a man receive circumcision on the sabbath-day, that the law of Moses should not be violated; are ye incensed against me, because I have made a man whole on the sabbath-day?
043	JOH	007	024	Judge not by appearance, but judge righteous judgment.
043	JOH	007	025	Then said some of the people of Jerusalem, is not this the man whom they are seeking to kill?
043	JOH	007	026	And, lo! he speaketh openly, and they say not a word to him. Do the rulers certainly know that this man is really the Messiah?
043	JOH	007	027	But we know this man whence he is: but when the Messiah cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.
043	JOH	007	028	Then spake Jesus aloud as he was teaching in the temple, and said, Ye both know me, and ye know from whence I am: and I came not of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.
043	JOH	007	029	But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.
043	JOH	007	030	Then they sought to apprehend him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.
043	JOH	007	031	But many of the multitude believed on him, and said, When the Messiah cometh, will he do greater miracles than those which this man doth?
043	JOH	007	032	The Pharisees heard the people muttering these things respecting him; and the Pharisees and chief priests sent officers to apprehend him.
043	JOH	007	033	Then said Jesus unto them, A little while longer I am with you, and I am going to him that sent me.
043	JOH	007	034	Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, ye cannot come.
043	JOH	007	035	Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will this man go, that we shall not find him? will he go to the dispersed among the Grecians, and teach the Greeks?
043	JOH	007	036	What is this saying which he hath spoken, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, ye cannot come?
043	JOH	007	037	Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood up and spake aloud, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.
043	JOH	007	038	He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, from his belly shall rivers flow of living water.
043	JOH	007	039	(Now he spake this in reference to the Spirit, which they who believe on him should afterwards receive: for as yet the Holy Ghost was not given; because Jesus was not yet glorified.)
043	JOH	007	040	Many then of the multitude, when they heard this declaration, said, This man is certainly a prophet.
043	JOH	007	041	Others said, He is the Messiah. But others said, No: for cometh the Messiah out of Galilee?
043	JOH	007	042	Doth not the scripture say, That the Messiah cometh of the seed of David, and from the town of Bethlehem, whence David originally was?
043	JOH	007	043	There was a division therefore among the multitude on account of him.
043	JOH	007	044	Now some of them were desirous to apprehend him; but no one laid hands upon him.
043	JOH	007	045	Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisee; and they said to them, Why have ye not brought him?
043	JOH	007	046	The officers answered, Never did man before speak in such a manner as this man.
043	JOH	007	047	The Pharisees then replied to them, Are ye also deluded?
043	JOH	007	048	Hath any one of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?
043	JOH	007	049	But this rabble, which knoweth not the law, is accursed.
043	JOH	007	050	Nicodemus saith unto them, (the same person who came to him by night, being one of their body, )
043	JOH	007	051	Doth our law condemn a man, without first hearing his defence, and knowing what he hath done?
043	JOH	007	052	They answered and said to him, Art thou not from Galilee too? Search and see: for a prophet, out of Galilee, never was raised up.
043	JOH	007	053	So each went to his own home.
043	JOH	008	001	THEN Jesus went to the mount of Olives.
043	JOH	008	002	But early in the morning he came again to the temple, and all the people came to him; and sitting down he taught them.
043	JOH	008	003	Then the scribes and Pharisees brought to him a woman caught in adultery; and placing her in the midst,
043	JOH	008	004	they say unto him, Master, this woman was caught in adultery, in the very act.
043	JOH	008	005	Now Moses in the law commanded, that such women should be stoned: therefore what sayest thou?
043	JOH	008	006	But this they said, trying to entrap him, that they might have ground of accusation against him. But Jesus stooping down, with his finger wrote on the ground.
043	JOH	008	007	Now when they continued questioning him, raising himself up, he said to them, Let the person who is sinless among you, first cast a stone at her.
043	JOH	008	008	And again stooping down, he wrote on the ground.
043	JOH	008	009	But when they heard him, and felt the conviction of their conscience, they slunk away one by one, beginning from the elders to the last: so Jesus was left alone, with the woman standing in the midst.
043	JOH	008	010	Then Jesus raising himself up, and seeing no person but the woman, said unto her, Woman, where are these thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?
043	JOH	008	011	She said, No man, Lord. Then said Jesus unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.
043	JOH	008	012	Then spake Jesus again to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
043	JOH	008	013	The Pharisees said to him, Thou bearest witness of thyself; thy witness is not true.
043	JOH	008	014	Jesus answered and said to them, Though I do bear witness of myself, my witness is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I am going; but ye know not whence I come, nor whither I am going.
043	JOH	008	015	Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.
043	JOH	008	016	But though I should judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent me.
043	JOH	008	017	Now even in your law it is written, that the testimony of two men is true.
043	JOH	008	018	I am a witness for myself, and the Father who sent me beareth witness of me.
043	JOH	008	019	Then said they to him, Where is thy father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also.
043	JOH	008	020	These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no person apprehended him; for his hour was not yet come.
043	JOH	008	021	Then spake Jesus again to them, I am going away, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sin: whither I am going ye cannot come.
043	JOH	008	022	The Jews said therefore, Will he kill himself? because he said, Whither I go, ye cannot come.
043	JOH	008	023	And he said to them, Ye are from those beneath; I am from those above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.
043	JOH	008	024	I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am, ye shall die in your sins.
043	JOH	008	025	They said, therefore to him, Who art thou? And Jesus said to them, Assuredly the same as I am telling you.
043	JOH	008	026	I have many things to speak and to decide concerning you: but he that sent me is true; and the things which I have heard from him I speak to the world.
043	JOH	008	027	They knew not that he spake to them of the Father.
043	JOH	008	028	Then said Jesus to them, When ye shall have lifted up on high the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am, and of myself have I done nothing; but as the Father hath instructed me, so I speak.
043	JOH	008	029	And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; because I always do the things acceptable to him.
043	JOH	008	030	As he spake these words, many believed on him.
043	JOH	008	031	Then said Jesus to those Jews who believed on him, If ye abide in my word, assuredly ye are my disciples;
043	JOH	008	032	and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
043	JOH	008	033	They answered him, We are Abraham’s seed, and never were in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, That we shall be made free?
043	JOH	008	034	Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, That every one who committeth sin is the slave of sin.
043	JOH	008	035	But the slave abideth not in the family for ever: but the son abideth for ever.
043	JOH	008	036	If the Son therefore make you free, ye will be truly free.
043	JOH	008	037	I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; yet ye seek to kill me, because my word has no place in you.
043	JOH	008	038	I speak what I have seen with my Father: and ye do therefore what ye have seen with your father.
043	JOH	008	039	They answered and said unto him, Our Father is Abraham. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were the children of Abraham, ye would have done the works of Abraham.
043	JOH	008	040	But now ye seek to kill me, a man who hath told you the truth, which I have heard from God. Abraham did not so.
043	JOH	008	041	Ye do the works of your father. They said unto him, We are not born of whoredom; we have one Father, even God.
043	JOH	008	042	Then said Jesus unto them, If God was your Father, ye would have loved me: for I came out from God, and I am coming; neither indeed came I of myself, but he hath sent me.
043	JOH	008	043	Wherefore do ye not understand my speech? because ye cannot hear my word.
043	JOH	008	044	Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will practise. He was a murderer from the beginning, and stood not fast in the truth, because truth was not in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh what is peculiarly his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.
043	JOH	008	045	But because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.
043	JOH	008	046	Which of you can convict me of sin? Now if I speak the truth, why do ye not believe me?
043	JOH	008	047	He that is of God heareth the words of God: ye therefore do not hear him, because ye are not of God.
043	JOH	008	048	Then answered the Jews, and said to him, Do we not rightly affirm, that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?
043	JOH	008	049	Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye dishonour me.
043	JOH	008	050	But I seek not my own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.
043	JOH	008	051	Verily, verily, I say unto you, If any man observe my saying, he shall never see death to all eternity.
043	JOH	008	052	Then said the Jews to him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If any man observe my word, he shall never taste of death to eternity.
043	JOH	008	053	Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?
043	JOH	008	054	Jesus answered, If I assume glory to myself, my glory is nothing: it is the Father who glorifies me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:
043	JOH	008	055	yet have ye not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, that I know him not, I should be like you, a liar: but I know him, and observe his word.
043	JOH	008	056	Your father Abraham exulted for joy that he should see this day of mine: and saw it, and rejoiced.
043	JOH	008	057	Then said the Jews unto him, Thou hast not yet reached the age of fifty, and hast thou seen Abraham?
043	JOH	008	058	Jesus said unto them, Before Abraham had a being, I Am.
043	JOH	008	059	Then took they up stones to hurl at him: but Jesus was hid, and went out of the temple, passing through the midst of them, and so went away.
043	JOH	009	001	AND as he passed along, he saw a man blind from his birth.
043	JOH	009	002	And his disciples inquired of him, saying, Rabbi, who was in fault, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?
043	JOH	009	003	Jesus answered, Neither hath this man been in fault, nor his parents; but it is in order to make manifest the works of God in him.
043	JOH	009	004	I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night is coming, when no man can work.
043	JOH	009	005	As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
043	JOH	009	006	So speaking, he spat on the ground, and made mud with the spittle, and anointed with the mud the eyes of the blind man;
043	JOH	009	007	and said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which signifies, Sent.) Then he went and washed, and came seeing.
043	JOH	009	008	The neighbours therefore, and they who saw him formerly, that he was blind, said, Is not this the man who was sitting and begging?
043	JOH	009	009	Some said, That this is he: but others, That he is like him: he himself said, I am he.
043	JOH	009	010	When said they to him, How were thine eyes opened?
043	JOH	009	011	he answered and said, A man called Jesus made mud, and anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: then I went, and washing received sight.
043	JOH	009	012	They said to him, Where is he? He replied, I know not.
043	JOH	009	013	They brought him to the Pharisees, who had before been blind.
043	JOH	009	014	(Now it was the sabbath-day when Jesus made the mud, and opened his eyes.)
043	JOH	009	015	The Pharisees therefore questioned him again, How he had received sight? And he told them, He put mud upon my eyes, and I washed, and do see.
043	JOH	009	016	Then said certain of the Pharisees, This man is not from God, because he observeth not the sabbath. Others said, How is it possible for a wicked man to do such miracles? And there was a division among them.
043	JOH	009	017	They say to the blind man again, What sayest thou of him? that he opened thine eyes? Then he replied, That he is a prophet.
043	JOH	009	018	Then the Jews did not believe that he had been blind, and received sight, until that they had called the parents of him who had received sight.
043	JOH	009	019	And they questioned them, saying, Is this your son, of whom ye say, that he was born blind? how then doth he now see?
043	JOH	009	020	His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:
043	JOH	009	021	but how he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he himself will tell you about it.
043	JOH	009	022	So spake his parents, because they were afraid of the Jews: for the Jews had already come to a resolution, that if any person acknowledged him Messiah, he should be excluded the synagogue.
043	JOH	009	023	Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.
043	JOH	009	024	The second time therefore they called the man who had been blind, and said unto him, Give the glory to God: we know that this man is a sinner.
043	JOH	009	025	Then answered he and said, Whether this man be a sinner, I know not: one thing I do know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.
043	JOH	009	026	Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eves?
043	JOH	009	027	He answered them, I have already told you, and ye did not hearken: why do ye wish to hear it again? will ye also become his disciples?
043	JOH	009	028	Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple, but we are the disciples of Moses.
043	JOH	009	029	We know that God spake to Moses: but we know nothing of this man, whence he is.
043	JOH	009	030	The man replied, and said to them, Now herein is something very surprising, that you know not whence he is, though he hath opened my eyes.
043	JOH	009	031	Now we know that God doth not hearken to sinners: but if any man be a devout worshipper, and doeth his will, him he heareth.
043	JOH	009	032	From the creation of the world hath it never been heard, that any man opened the eyes of one born blind.
043	JOH	009	033	If this man were not from God, he could not do any thing.
043	JOH	009	034	They answered and said unto him, Thou wast wholly born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.
043	JOH	009	035	Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and finding him, said to him, Believest thou in the Son of God?
043	JOH	009	036	The man answered and said, Who is he, Sir, that I might believe on him?
043	JOH	009	037	Then said Jesus him, Thou hast even seen him, and he that is now talking with thee is the very person.
043	JOH	009	038	Then he said, Lord, I believe: and worshipped him.
043	JOH	009	039	And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they who see not may see; and they who see become blind.
043	JOH	009	040	And some of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said to him, Are we blind also?
043	JOH	009	041	Jesus said to them, If ye were blind, ye should not have had sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin is permanent.
043	JOH	010	001	VERILY, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheep-fold, but getteth in some other way, that person is a thief and a robber.
043	JOH	010	002	He that entereth by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
043	JOH	010	003	To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own peculiar sheep by name, and leadeth them forth.
043	JOH	010	004	And when he bringeth out his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: because they know his voice.
043	JOH	010	005	And a stranger will they not follow, but will fly from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.
043	JOH	010	006	This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they knew nothing of the things which he spake to them.
043	JOH	010	007	Therefore Jesus said unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that I am the door of the sheep.
043	JOH	010	008	All, as many as have gone before me, are thieves and robbers: but the sheep hearkened not to them.
043	JOH	010	009	I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved; and shall go in and out, and find pasture.
043	JOH	010	010	The thief cometh not but to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.
043	JOH	010	011	I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep.
043	JOH	010	012	But the hireling, and he that is not the shepherd, whose own property the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth; and the wolf seizes upon them, and disperseth the sheep.
043	JOH	010	013	Now the hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.
043	JOH	010	014	I am the good shepherd, and know my own sheep, and am known of my own.
043	JOH	010	015	As the Father knoweth me, so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.
043	JOH	010	016	And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: these also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, one shepherd.
043	JOH	010	017	Therefore doth the Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.
043	JOH	010	018	No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment I have received from my Father.
043	JOH	010	019	There was therefore a division again among the Jews, on account of these sayings.
043	JOH	010	020	Then many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hearken to him?
043	JOH	010	021	Others said, These are not the discourses of a demoniac. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?
043	JOH	010	022	Then was the feast of dedication at Jerusalem, and it was winter.
043	JOH	010	023	And Jesus was walking in the temple, in Solomon’s portico.
043	JOH	010	024	Then the Jews came about him, and said to him, How long dost thou keep our soul in suspense? If thou art the Messiah, tell us plainly.
043	JOH	010	025	Jesus answered them; I told you, and ye believed not: the works which I do in the name of my Father, they bear witness of me.
043	JOH	010	026	But ye believe not, for ye are not of my sheep, as I told you.
043	JOH	010	027	My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:
043	JOH	010	028	and I give unto them everlasting life and they shall never perish to eternity, and no person shall pluck them out of my hand.
043	JOH	010	029	My Father, who gave them to me, is greater than all and no one shall pluck them out of my Father’s hand.
043	JOH	010	030	I and my Father are one.
043	JOH	010	031	Then the Jews again brought stones, in order to stone him.
043	JOH	010	032	Jesus said unto them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which work of these are ye going to stone me?
043	JOH	010	033	The Jews answered him, For a good work we do not stone thee; but for blasphemy; and that thou, being merely a man, makest thyself God.
043	JOH	010	034	Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, “I said ye are gods?”
043	JOH	010	035	If he called those gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;
043	JOH	010	036	do ye say of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest because I said, I am the Son of God?
043	JOH	010	037	If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.
043	JOH	010	038	But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.
043	JOH	010	039	Then sought they again to apprehend him and he departed out of their reach,
043	JOH	010	040	and went again beyond Jordan, unto the place where John at first baptised; and there he abode.
043	JOH	010	041	And many came to him, and said, That John indeed performed no miracle: but all things whatsoever John spake of this man were true.
043	JOH	010	042	And many believed on him there.
043	JOH	011	001	NOW there was a sick man, Lazarus, of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
043	JOH	011	002	(It was the Mary who had anointed the Lord with the balm, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)
043	JOH	011	003	The sisters therefore sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.
043	JOH	011	004	When Jesus heard it, he said, This sickness is not for death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified thereby.
043	JOH	011	005	Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
043	JOH	011	006	Then, though he heard he was ill, yet notwithstanding he abode in the same place where he was two days.
043	JOH	011	007	But after that he saith to his disciples, Let us go again into Judea.
043	JOH	011	008	The disciples say unto him, Rabbi, the Jews have just now sought to stone thee; and art thou going thither again?
043	JOH	011	009	Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he doth not stumble, because he seeth the light of this world.
043	JOH	011	010	But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light with him.
043	JOH	011	011	These things said he: and after that he saith to them, Our friend Lazarus is asleep; but I go to waken him up.
043	JOH	011	012	Then said his disciples, Lord, if he is asleep, he will recover.
043	JOH	011	013	Now Jesus had spoken of his death: but they apprehended that he spake of taking rest in sleep.
043	JOH	011	014	Then Jesus therefore told them plainly, Lazarus is dead.
043	JOH	011	015	And I rejoice on your account that I was not there, in order that ye may believe; but let us go to him.
043	JOH	011	016	Then said Thomas, (called Didymus, the twin, ) to his fellow-disciples, Let us go too, that we may die with him.
043	JOH	011	017	Then Jesus, when he came; found that he had already lain in the tomb four days.
043	JOH	011	018	Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:
043	JOH	011	019	and many of the Jews had come with the women who were about Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.
043	JOH	011	020	Then Martha, when she heard that Jesus was coming, met him: but Mary sat in the house.
043	JOH	011	021	And Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
043	JOH	011	022	But even now I know, that whatsoever things thou shalt ask of God, God will give thee.
043	JOH	011	023	Jesus saith to her, Thy brother shall rise again.
043	JOH	011	024	Martha saith to him, I know that he shall rise at the resurrection in the last day.
043	JOH	011	025	Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:
043	JOH	011	026	and every one who is alive, and believeth in me, shall never die to eternity. Believest thou this?
043	JOH	011	027	She saith to him, Yes, Lord I believe that thou art the Messiah, the Son of God, who cometh into the world.
043	JOH	011	028	So when she had thus spoken, she went away, and called her sister Mary privately, saying, The Master is near at hand, and calleth for thee.
043	JOH	011	029	As soon as she heard it, she rose hastily, and came to him.
043	JOH	011	030	Now Jesus was not yet come into the village, but was on the spot where Martha had met him.
043	JOH	011	031	Then the Jews who were with her in the house, and comforting her, observing Mary, that she rose up hastily, and went out, followed her, saying, She is going to the tomb, to weep there.
043	JOH	011	032	When therefore Mary was come where Jesus was, beholding him, she fell at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother would not have died!
043	JOH	011	033	When Jesus then saw her weeping, and all the Jews who came with her lamenting, he groaned in spirit, and was himself greatly agitated:
043	JOH	011	034	and he said, Where have ye laid him? They say to him, Lord, come and see.
043	JOH	011	035	Jesus wept.
043	JOH	011	036	Then said the Jews, Behold, how he loved him!
043	JOH	011	037	But some of them said, Could not this man, who openeth the eyes of the blind, have caused that this person should not have died?
043	JOH	011	038	Then Jesus again groaning in himself, cometh to the sepulchre. It was an excavation, and a stone lay upon it.
043	JOH	011	039	Jesus saith, Remove the stone. The sister of the deceased, Martha, said to him, Lord, he is by this time putrid: for he hath been dead four days.
043	JOH	011	040	Jesus saith unto her, Did I not tell thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shalt see the glory of God?
043	JOH	011	041	Then they removed the stone where the deceased was lying. And Jesus lifted his eyes upwards, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me!
043	JOH	011	042	And I knew that thou always dost hear me: but for the sake of the multitude standing by I spake, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.
043	JOH	011	043	And when he had thus spoken, with a loud voice he cried, Lazarus, come forth!
043	JOH	011	044	And the deceased came forth, his feet and his hands wrapped with the linen swathes; and his face bound round with a napkin. Jesus saith to them, Loose him, and let him go!
043	JOH	011	045	Then many of the Jews who came to Mary, and saw what Jesus had done, believed on him.
043	JOH	011	046	But some of them went to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.
043	JOH	011	047	The chief priests and Pharisees therefore called the sanhedrim together, and said, What are we about? for this man is doing many miracles.
043	JOH	011	048	If we suffer him to go on thus, all men will believe on him: and the Romans will come, and take away both our place and nation.
043	JOH	011	049	Then one particular person of them, Caiaphas, being the high-priest of that year, said unto them, Ye know nothing,
043	JOH	011	050	nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation be not destroyed.
043	JOH	011	051	And this he spake not from himself: but being the high-priest of that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation;
043	JOH	011	052	and not for that nation only, but that he should collect into one body the children of God wherever dispersed.
043	JOH	011	053	Then from that day they consulted together how they might kill him.
043	JOH	011	054	Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews, but went thence into the country bordering on the desert, to a city called Ephraim, and there he abode with his disciples.
043	JOH	011	055	Now the passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the passover, in order to purify themselves.
043	JOH	011	056	Then they sought for Jesus, and said one to another, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?
043	JOH	011	057	Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given commandment, that, if any person knew where he was, they should declare it, that they might apprehend him.
043	JOH	012	001	JESUS then before the days of the passover came to Bethany, where the deceased Lazarus was, whom he had raised from the dead.
043	JOH	012	002	Therefore they made him a supper there; and Martha waited: but Lazarus was one of those who sat at table with him.
043	JOH	012	003	Then Mary taking a pound of unadulterated balm of nard, very valuable, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.
043	JOH	012	004	Then said one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, who was preparing to betray him,
043	JOH	012	005	Wherefore was not this aromatic ointment sold for three hundred denarii, and given to the poor?
043	JOH	012	006	Now he said this, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and kept the purse, and carried the money put therein.
043	JOH	012	007	Then said Jesus, Let her alone: for the day of my burial hath she reserved this.
043	JOH	012	008	For the poor ye have always with you; but me ye have not always.
043	JOH	012	009	Then the whole multitude of the Jews knew that he was there: and they came not for the sake of Jesus only, but also that they might see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.
043	JOH	012	010	Then the chief priests consulted how they might kill Lazarus also;
043	JOH	012	011	because on his account many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.
043	JOH	012	012	On the morrow a great multitude who came to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
043	JOH	012	013	took branches of palm, and went out to meet him, and cried, Hosanna! blessed is the king of Israel, that cometh in the name of the Lord.
043	JOH	012	014	Then Jesus, having found a young ass, sat upon it; as it is written,
043	JOH	012	015	“Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on the foal of an ass.”
043	JOH	012	016	These things indeed knew not his disciples at first: but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.
043	JOH	012	017	Then the multitude that was with him, when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, bore their testimony.
043	JOH	012	018	Therefore also the multitude met him, because they had heard that he had done this miracle.
043	JOH	012	019	Then said the Pharisees among themselves, Do ye not perceive that ye gain no advantage? behold, the world is gone after him.
043	JOH	012	020	Now there were certain Greeks among those who went up to worship at the feast:
043	JOH	012	021	these then came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida, of Galilee, and they asked him, saying, Sir, we wish to see Jesus.
043	JOH	012	022	Philip comes and speaks to Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.
043	JOH	012	023	Then Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.
043	JOH	012	024	Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a grain of wheat falling on the earth undergo a deathlike change, it abideth single: but if it thus die, it beareth abundant produce.
043	JOH	012	025	He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world, shall preserve it to life eternal.
043	JOH	012	026	If a man will be my servant, let him follow me; and where I am, there also shall my servant be: and if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.
043	JOH	012	027	Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.
043	JOH	012	028	Father, glorify thy name! Then came a voice from heaven, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.
043	JOH	012	029	The multitude that stood by, and heard it, said that it was thunder: others said, An angel hath spoken to him.
043	JOH	012	030	Jesus answered and said, This voice came not for my sake, but for your’s.
043	JOH	012	031	Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the ruler of this world be ejected out of it.
043	JOH	012	032	And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.
043	JOH	012	033	And this he said, signifying by what death he should die.
043	JOH	012	034	Then the multitude answered him, We have heard out of the law, that the Messiah abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, That the Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?
043	JOH	012	035	Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest the darkness overtake you: he that walketh in darkness, knoweth not even whither he is going.
043	JOH	012	036	While ye have the light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of the light. These things spake Jesus, and going away, concealed himself from them.
043	JOH	012	037	Now, though he had done so many miracles before them, they believed not on him:
043	JOH	012	038	that the saying of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, “Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?”
043	JOH	012	039	For this reason they could not believe, because Isaiah had said again;
043	JOH	012	040	“He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their hearts; lest they should see with their eyes, and understand with the heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.”
043	JOH	012	041	These things said Isaiah, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.
043	JOH	012	042	However, notwithstanding, many even of the rulers believed on him; but on account of the Pharisees they did not make open profession, lest they should be put out of the synagogues:
043	JOH	012	043	for they loved honour from men, more than honour from God.
043	JOH	012	044	Then Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.
043	JOH	012	045	And he that seeth me, seeth him that sent me.
043	JOH	012	046	I am come a light into the world, that every one who believeth on me should not abide in darkness.
043	JOH	012	047	And if any man, hearing my words, believeth not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.
043	JOH	012	048	He that sets me at nought, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: even the word which I have spoken, the same shall judge him at the last day.
043	JOH	012	049	Because I have not spoken of myself; but the Farther who has sent me, he gave me commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.
043	JOH	012	050	And I know that his commandment is life eternal: therefore the things which I speak to you, just as the Father spake to me, so speak I.
043	JOH	013	001	NOW before the feast of the passover, Jesus, knowing that his hour was come, that he should go out of this world to the Father, having loved his peculiar people that are in the world, he loved them to the end.
043	JOH	013	002	And supper being served, (the devil having now injected into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, that he should betray him; )
043	JOH	013	003	Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he came out from God, and was going to God;
043	JOH	013	004	he rises from supper, and lays aside his garments, and taking a towel, he wound it about himself.
043	JOH	013	005	Then he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which he was begirt.
043	JOH	013	006	Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and he saith to him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?
043	JOH	013	007	Jesus answered and said to him, What I am doing thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.
043	JOH	013	008	Peter saith to him, Thou shalt never wash my feet: no, never. Jesus answered him, Except I wash thee, thou hast no part with me.
043	JOH	013	009	Simon Peter saith to him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.
043	JOH	013	010	Jesus saith to him, He that is washed hath need only to wash his feet, for he is entirely clean: and ye are clean, but not all.
043	JOH	013	011	(For he knew who would betray him; therefore he said, Ye are not all clean.)
043	JOH	013	012	When therefore he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, and sat down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done unto you?
043	JOH	013	013	Ye call me Master, and Lord: and ye speak truly; for such I am.
043	JOH	013	014	If therefore I have washed your feet, though the Lord and the Master; ye also ought to wash one another’s feet.
043	JOH	013	015	For I have given you an example, that just as I have done to you, ye should do also.
043	JOH	013	016	Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his master; nor the messenger greater than him that sent him.
043	JOH	013	017	If ye know these things, blessed are ye if ye practise them.
043	JOH	013	018	I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me, hath lift up his heel against me.
043	JOH	013	019	Now I tell you previously, before this comes to pass, that, when it cometh to pass, ye may believe that I am.
043	JOH	013	020	Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I shall send, receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me.
043	JOH	013	021	As Jesus was speaking these words, he was greatly agitated in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.
043	JOH	013	022	Then the disciples looked one at another, doubting of whom he spake.
043	JOH	013	023	Now there was one of the disciples reclining on the bosom of Jesus, whom Jesus loved.
043	JOH	013	024	Therefore Simon Peter gave him a significant look, that he should inquire of Jesus, which of them it should be of whom he spake.
043	JOH	013	025	And he leaning on the breast of Jesus, said to him, Lord, which is it?
043	JOH	013	026	Jesus answered, It is he to whom I shall give this morsel of bread, when I have dipped it. And dipping the morsel of bread, he gave it unto Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.
043	JOH	013	027	And after the sop, then entered Satan into him. Jesus saith to him, What thou doest, do quickly.
043	JOH	013	028	Now none of those who sat at table knew wherefore he had spoken to him.
043	JOH	013	029	For some supposed, as Judas kept the purse, that Jesus was saying to him, Buy what we need for the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.
043	JOH	013	030	Having then received the sop, he went out immediately: now it was night.
043	JOH	013	031	When therefore he was gone, Jesus saith, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.
043	JOH	013	032	If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him with himself, and immediately glorify him.
043	JOH	013	033	My dear children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: as I said to the Jews, Whither I am going, ye cannot come; so say I now to you.
043	JOH	013	034	A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; even as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.
043	JOH	013	035	By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.
043	JOH	013	036	Simon Peter saith to him, Lord, Whither art thou going? Jesus answered him, Whither I am going, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me hereafter.
043	JOH	013	037	Peter saith to him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thee.
043	JOH	013	038	Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for me? Verily, verily, I tell thee, the cock will not crow, before thou shalt deny me thrice.
043	JOH	014	001	LET not your hearts be troubled: trust in God, and trust in me.
043	JOH	014	002	In my Father’s house are many mansions: and if not, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.
043	JOH	014	003	And if I go and prepare you a place, I will come again, and receive you to myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.
043	JOH	014	004	And whither I am going ye know, and the way ye know.
043	JOH	014	005	Thomas saith to him, We know not whither thou art going; and how can we know the way?
043	JOH	014	006	Jesus saith to him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no man cometh to the Father, but by me.
043	JOH	014	007	If ye had known me, ye would have known my Father: and from henceforth ye know him and have seen him.
043	JOH	014	008	Philip saith to him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us.
043	JOH	014	009	Jesus saith to him, Am I all this while with you, and hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou, Shew us the Father?
043	JOH	014	010	Dost thou not believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? the words which I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father, who dwelleth in me, he performeth these works.
043	JOH	014	011	Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: and at least believe me on account of the works themselves.
043	JOH	014	012	Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works which I do shall he do also; yea, and greater than these shall he do; because I go to the Father.
043	JOH	014	013	And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
043	JOH	014	014	If ye ask any thing in my name, I will do it.
043	JOH	014	015	If ye love me, keep my commandments.
043	JOH	014	016	And I will ask the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;
043	JOH	014	017	the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; because he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.
043	JOH	014	018	I will not leave you orphans: I am coming to you.
043	JOH	014	019	Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also.
043	JOH	014	020	In that day ye shall know that I am in the Father, and ye in me, and I in you.
043	JOH	014	021	He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he is the person who loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.
043	JOH	014	022	Then Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself to us, and not unto the world?
043	JOH	014	023	Jesus answered and said to him, If any man love me, he will observe my word: and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our abode with him.
043	JOH	014	024	He that loveth me not, doth not observe my sayings: and the word which ye are hearing is not mine, but of him that sent me.
043	JOH	014	025	These things have I spoken to you, while I continue among you.
043	JOH	014	026	But the Comforter, the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, which I have spoken to you.
043	JOH	014	027	Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I to you. Let not your heart be agitated, nor shrink back through fear.
043	JOH	014	028	Ye have heard that I told you, I am going away, though I am coming again to you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I am going to the Father: because my Father is greater than I.
043	JOH	014	029	And now I have informed you before it comes to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe.
043	JOH	014	030	I shall not speak many things more with you: for the ruler of this world is coming, though in me he hath no part.
043	JOH	014	031	But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father hath given me commandment, so I do. Arise, let us go hence.
043	JOH	015	001	I AM the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.
043	JOH	015	002	Every branch in me that beareth no fruit, he taketh it away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he pruneth it clean, that it may bring forth more fruit.
043	JOH	015	003	Ye are already clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.
043	JOH	015	004	Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abide in the vine: so neither can ye, except ye abide in me.
043	JOH	015	005	I am the vine, ye are the branches: he that abideth in me, and I in him, this person beareth much fruit: because without me ye can do nothing.
043	JOH	015	006	If any man abide not in me, he is cast out as a branch, and withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.
043	JOH	015	007	If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask whatsoever ye will, and it shall be done for you.
043	JOH	015	008	Herein is my Father glorified, that ye should bring forth much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.
043	JOH	015	009	Just as the Father hath loved me, I also have loved you: abide in my love.
043	JOH	015	010	If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and as I abide in his love.
043	JOH	015	011	These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy may abide in you, and your joy may be full.
043	JOH	015	012	This is my commandment, That ye love one another, just as I have loved you.
043	JOH	015	013	Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.
043	JOH	015	014	Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever things I command you.
043	JOH	015	015	I no more call you servants; for the servant knoweth not what his master is doing: but I have called you friends because I have made known to you all things which I have heard of my Father.
043	JOH	015	016	Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and appointed you that ye should go forth and bear fruit, and that your fruit should be permanent: that so whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he may give it you.
043	JOH	015	017	These things I command you, that ye love one another.
043	JOH	015	018	If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before you.
043	JOH	015	019	If ye were of the world, the world would love its own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have elected you out of the world, for this very cause the world hateth you.
043	JOH	015	020	Remember the word which I spake unto you, The servant is not greater than his master. If they have persecuted me, they will persecute you also; if they have observed my words, they will observe your’s also.
043	JOH	015	021	But all these things will they do unto you for my name’s sake, because they know not him that sent me.
043	JOH	015	022	Had I not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin: but now they have no excuse for their sin.
043	JOH	015	023	He that hateth me hateth my Father also.
043	JOH	015	024	If I had not done among them the works which no other ever did, they would not have had sin: but now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father.
043	JOH	015	025	But it is in order that the word may be fulfilled which is written in their law, “They hated me without a cause.”
043	JOH	015	026	But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:
043	JOH	015	027	and ye too shall bear your testimony, because ye have been with me from the beginning.
043	JOH	016	001	THESE things have I spoken, that ye might not be stumbled.
043	JOH	016	002	They will put you out of their synagogues: yea, the hour is coming, that every one who killeth you will think he offers God a sacred service.
043	JOH	016	003	And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.
043	JOH	016	004	But these things have I spoken to you, that when the hour is come, ye may remember the same for I had told you. But these things I told you not at the beginning, because I was with you.
043	JOH	016	005	But now I am going away to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither art thou going?
043	JOH	016	006	But because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow hath filled your heart.
043	JOH	016	007	Yet I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I went not away, the Comforter would not come to you; but if I go, I will send him unto you.
043	JOH	016	008	And when he cometh, he will convince the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment:
043	JOH	016	009	of sin first, because they believe not in me;
043	JOH	016	010	then of righteousness, because I am going to the Father, so ye see me no more;
043	JOH	016	011	and of judgment, because the ruler of this world hath sentence pronounced on him.
043	JOH	016	012	I have many things to say to you, but ye cannot bear them just now.
043	JOH	016	013	But when he is come, the Spirit of truth, he will conduct you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever things he shall hear, he shall speak: and he will declare to you the things that shall come hereafter.
043	JOH	016	014	He shall glorify me: for he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.
043	JOH	016	015	All things whatsoever the Father hath are mine: therefore I said, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.
043	JOH	016	016	A little while longer, and ye shall not see me: and again a little while, and ye shall see me, because I am going to the Father.
043	JOH	016	017	Then said some of the disciples unto each other, What is this which he saith to us, A little while longer, and ye shall not see me: and again a little while, and ye shall see me: and this, because I am going to the Father?
043	JOH	016	018	They said therefore, What is this which he saith, This little while? we know not what he means.
043	JOH	016	019	Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Are ye questioning among yourselves concerning this declaration, which I spake, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again a little while, and ye shall see me?
043	JOH	016	020	Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be very sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.
043	JOH	016	021	A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but when the little son is born, she no more remembers the anguish, for joy that a man is brought into the world.
043	JOH	016	022	And ye therefore have indeed at present sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall be made glad, and your joy no man taketh from you.
043	JOH	016	023	And in that hour ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, That whatsoever things ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give you.
043	JOH	016	024	Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be complete.
043	JOH	016	025	These things have I spoken to you in parables: but the hour is coming when I will no more speak to you in parables, but will plainly inform you respecting the Father.
043	JOH	016	026	In that day ye shall ask in my name: and I do not say to you, I will entreat the Father for you:
043	JOH	016	027	for the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.
043	JOH	016	028	I came out from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I am leaving the world, and going to the Father.
043	JOH	016	029	His disciples said unto him, Lo! now thou speakest plainly, and speakest in no-wise proverbial.
043	JOH	016	030	Now we know that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any person should ask thee: by this we believe that thou hast come forth from God.
043	JOH	016	031	Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?
043	JOH	016	032	Behold, the hour is coming, yea, it is already come, that ye shall be dispersed, each after his own concerns, and shall leave me alone: though I am not alone, because the Father is with me.
043	JOH	016	033	These things have I spoken to you, that ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good courage; I have overcome the world.
043	JOH	017	001	THESE things spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son may glorify thee:
043	JOH	017	002	even as thou hast given him authority over all flesh, that with regard to all those whom thou hast given him, he should give to them eternal life:
043	JOH	017	003	and this is eternal life, that they should know thee the only true God, and him whom thou hast sent, Jesus, the Messiah.
043	JOH	017	004	I have glorified thee upon earth: I have completed the work which thou gavest me to perform.
043	JOH	017	005	And now, Father, do thou glorify me with thyself in the glory which I held with thee before the world was.
043	JOH	017	006	I have made known thy name to the persons whom thou gavest me out of the world: for thee they had a being, and to me thou hast given them; and thy word have they kept.
043	JOH	017	007	Now have they known, that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are from thee.
043	JOH	017	008	For the declarations which thou gavest to me I have delivered to them; and they have received them, and have known assuredly that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou hast sent me.
043	JOH	017	009	I entreat for them: I make no request for the world; but for those thou hast given me; for they are thine.
043	JOH	017	010	And all mine are thine, and thine mine; and I have been glorified in them.
043	JOH	017	011	And now no longer am I in this world, but these are in the world, and I am coming to thee. Holy Father! preserve them for thy name’s sake whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.
043	JOH	017	012	When I was with them in the world, I preserved them by thy name: those whom thou hast given me have I guarded, and not one of them is perished, except the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.
043	JOH	017	013	But now I am coming to thee; and I am speaking these things in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.
043	JOH	017	014	I have given them thy word and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
043	JOH	017	015	I entreat not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest preserve them from the wicked one.
043	JOH	017	016	They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.
043	JOH	017	017	Sanctify them by thy truth: thy word is truth.
043	JOH	017	018	As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I sent them into the world.
043	JOH	017	019	And for them I devote myself, that they also might be sanctified by the truth.
043	JOH	017	020	And not for them do I make request only, but also for those who shall believe in me through their word;
043	JOH	017	021	that all may be one; as thou, Father, in me, and I in thee, that these also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.
043	JOH	017	022	And I have given them the glory, which thou hast given me; that they may be one, even as we are one:
043	JOH	017	023	I in them, and thou in me, that they may be perfected into one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.
043	JOH	017	024	Father, those whom thou hast given me, I will that where I am they may also be with me; that they may behold my glory, which thou gavest me: because thou hast loved me before the foundation of the world.
043	JOH	017	025	Righteous Father! though the world hath not known thee, yet I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.
043	JOH	017	026	And I have made known to them thy name, and will make it known: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.
043	JOH	018	001	HAVING thus spoken, Jesus went out with his disciples beyond the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into which he went himself, and his disciples.
043	JOH	018	002	Now Judas also, who betrayed him, knew the place: for frequently had Jesus consorted with his disciples there.
043	JOH	018	003	Then Judas having taken a band of soldiers, and the inferior officers of the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and arms.
043	JOH	018	004	Jesus therefore, conscious of all things that were coming upon him, going forward, said to them, Whom are ye seeking?
043	JOH	018	005	They answered him, Jesus the Nazarean. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. Then stood also Judas, who betrayed him, with these men.
043	JOH	018	006	As he then spake to them, I am he, they retreated backward, and fell flat on the ground.
043	JOH	018	007	Again therefore he demanded of them, Whom seek ye? Then they said, Jesus the Nazarean.
043	JOH	018	008	Jesus answered, I told you that I am he: if therefore ye are seeking me, permit these to go away:
043	JOH	018	009	that the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, That of those whom thou hast given me, I have not lost one of them.
043	JOH	018	010	Then Simon Peter having a sword, drew it, and struck a servant of the high-priest, and cut off his right ear. Now the servant’s name was Malchas.
043	JOH	018	011	Then said Jesus to Peter, Put up thy sword into the scabbard: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?
043	JOH	018	012	The band therefore, and the chief captain, and the inferior officers of the Jews, seized on Jesus, and bound him,
043	JOH	018	013	and led him away to Annas first; for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was the high-priest of that year.
043	JOH	018	014	Now Caiaphas was the person who had given his advice to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should be destroyed instead of the people.
043	JOH	018	015	Now Simon Peter had followed Jesus, and another disciple: and that disciple was acquainted with the high-priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high-priest.
043	JOH	018	016	But Peter stood without at the door. Then that other disciple, who was acquainted with the high-priest, went out, and spoke to the porteress, and introduced Peter.
043	JOH	018	017	Then said the damsel who kept the door to Peter, Art not thou also one of the disciples of this man? He saith, I am not.
043	JOH	018	018	Now the servants and inferior officers having made a fire, for it was cold, stood and warmed themselves: and there stood Peter with them, and warmed himself.
043	JOH	018	019	The high-priest then questioned Jesus concerning his disciples, and respecting his doctrine.
043	JOH	018	020	Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I always taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews resorted; and in secret have I spoken nothing.
043	JOH	018	021	Why dost thou question me? ask those who have heard me, what I have spoken to them: lo, they know what I said.
043	JOH	018	022	As he was thus speaking, one of the servants who stood by him gave Jesus a slap on the face, saying, Dost thou answer the high-priest in this fashion?
043	JOH	018	023	Jesus replied to him, If I have spoken in an improper manner, bear witness of the evil deed: but if properly, why strikest thou me?
043	JOH	018	024	Now Annas had sent him bound to Caiaphas the high-priest.
043	JOH	018	025	Meanwhile Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. Then said they to him, Art not thou also one of this man’s disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not.
043	JOH	018	026	One of the servants of the high-priest, being a kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off, said, Did I not see thee in the garden with him?
043	JOH	018	027	Then again Peter denied: and instantly the cock crew.
043	JOH	018	028	Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas to the praetorium: and it was early: and they themselves went not into the praetorium, that they should not be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.
043	JOH	018	029	Pilate then came out to them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?
043	JOH	018	030	They answered and said to him, If this fellow had not been a malefactor, we should not have delivered him up to thee.
043	JOH	018	031	Pilate then said to them, Take him yourselves, and according to your own law judge him. The Jews then said to him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:
043	JOH	018	032	that the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, intimating by what manner of death he should die.
043	JOH	018	033	Pilate therefore entered again into the praetorium, and called Jesus, and said to him, Art thou the king of the Jews?
043	JOH	018	034	Jesus answered him, Dost thou speak this from thyself, or did others speak to thee concerning me?
043	JOH	018	035	Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thy own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee to me: what hast thou done?
043	JOH	018	036	Jesus replied, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom had been of this world, then would my servants have struggled hard, that I should not have been delivered up to the Jews: but now my kingdom is not from hence.
043	JOH	018	037	Then said Pilate unto him. Art thou not a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. For this end I was born, and for this I came into the world, that I should be a witness for the truth. Every one who is of the truth heareth my voice.
043	JOH	018	038	Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And having thus spoken, he went out again unto the Jews and saith to them, I find no fault in him.
043	JOH	018	039	But ye have a custom, that I should release to you one person at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?
043	JOH	018	040	Then again they all clamoured, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.
043	JOH	019	001	THEN Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.
043	JOH	019	002	And the soldiers having platted a crown of thorns, put it on his head, and they clothed him in a purple robe,
043	JOH	019	003	and said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they gave him slaps on the face with their hands.
043	JOH	019	004	Then again went Pilate out, and said to them, Behold, I bring him out to you, that ye may know that I find in him no fault at all.
043	JOH	019	005	Then came Jesus out, bearing the thorny crown, and the purple robe. And he said to them, Behold the man!
043	JOH	019	006	When the chief priests therefore and the officers saw him, they cried vociferously, saying, Crucify him! crucify him! Pilate saith to them, Take him yourselves, and crucify him: for I have not found in him a fault.
043	JOH	019	007	The Jews replied to him, We have a law, and according to our law he ought to die, because he hath made himself the Son of God.
043	JOH	019	008	When Pilate then heard this saying, he was the more afraid:
043	JOH	019	009	and entered into the praetorium again, and saith to Jesus, From whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.
043	JOH	019	010	Then saith Pilate to him, Dost thou not speak to me? dost thou not know that I have power to crucify thee, and that I have power to release thee?
043	JOH	019	011	Jesus answered, Thou wouldest have had no authority over me, unless it had been given thee from above: for this reason, he that hath delivered me up to thee hath the greater crime.
043	JOH	019	012	Upon this Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews clamoured, saying, If thou release this fellow, thou art no friend of Caesar’s: every one who professes himself a king, speaks in opposition to Caesar.
043	JOH	019	013	When Pilate therefore heard this speech, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment seat, in a place called the Stone Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.
043	JOH	019	014	And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith to the Jews, Behold your King!
043	JOH	019	015	But they cried vociferously, Away with him, away! crucify him! Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.
043	JOH	019	016	Then delivered he him therefore unto them, that he should be crucified. And they took Jesus and led him away.
043	JOH	019	017	And carrying his cross he went forth to a place called the Place of a Skull, which in the Hebrew is termed Golgotha:
043	JOH	019	018	where they crucified him, and two others with him, on this side and on that, and in the midst Jesus.
043	JOH	019	019	And Pilate also wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And this was the writing: JESUS THE NAZAREAN, THE KING OF THE JEWS,
043	JOH	019	020	This title then many of the Jews read: for the spot where Jesus was crucified was nigh unto the city: and it was written in Hebrew, in Greek, and in Latin.
043	JOH	019	021	The chief priests of the Jews then said to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.
043	JOH	019	022	Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written.
043	JOH	019	023	Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, for each soldier a part; and his vest: now the vest was without a seam, woven from the upper parts throughout the whole.
043	JOH	019	024	They said therefore one to another, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, “They parted my garments among them, and for my vest they cast lots.” So the soldiers therefore did these things.
043	JOH	019	025	Now beside the cross of Jesus stood his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Cleopas, and Mary Magdalene.
043	JOH	019	026	When Jesus then beheld his mother, and the disciple whom he loved, standing by, he saith to his mother, Woman, behold thy son!
043	JOH	019	027	Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour the disciple took her unto his own home.
043	JOH	019	028	After this, Jesus, conscious that all things were now finished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.
043	JOH	019	029	Now there was placed a vessel full of vinegar: they then filling a spunge with the vinegar, and putting it on a stick of hyssop, carried it to his mouth.
043	JOH	019	030	When therefore Jesus had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and inclining his head, he surrendered up his spirit.
043	JOH	019	031	The Jews therefore, as it was the preparation, that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath, (for that sabbath-day was a great day, ) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.
043	JOH	019	032	Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified with him.
043	JOH	019	033	But when they came to Jesus, as they saw that he was already dead, they brake not his legs:
043	JOH	019	034	but one of the soldiers with his lance pierced his side, and immediately there gushed out blood and water.
043	JOH	019	035	And he that saw it bore witness, and we know that his testimony is true: and he himself is conscious that he speaketh what is true, that ye might believe.
043	JOH	019	036	Now these things were done, that the scripture might be fulfilled, “A bone of him shall not be broken.”
043	JOH	019	037	And again another scripture saith, “They shall look on him whom they have pierced.”
043	JOH	019	038	And after these things Joseph of Arimathea, (being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, ) besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus and Pilate permitted him. Then he came and took away the body of Jesus.
043	JOH	019	039	And Nicodemus, who had come to Jesus by night formerly, came also, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred weight.
043	JOH	019	040	Then they took the body, and bound it with swathes together with the aromatics, as the custom is with the Jews to bury.
043	JOH	019	041	And there was near the spot were he was crucified a garden and in the garden a new tomb, wherein no person had ever yet been laid.
043	JOH	019	042	Because of the preparation of the Jews therefore, they laid Jesus there; for the sepulchre was just by.
043	JOH	020	001	AND on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalen came very early, whilst yet some darkness remained, to the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.
043	JOH	020	002	She therefore runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.
043	JOH	020	003	Then Peter went out, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre.
043	JOH	020	004	And they two ran together: and the other disciple ran before more swiftly than Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.
043	JOH	020	005	And stooping forward, he sees the swathing clothes lying there; yet he did not go in.
043	JOH	020	006	Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and saw the swathing clothes lying,
043	JOH	020	007	and the napkin, which had been round his head, not laid with the linen swathes, but apart folded up in another place.
043	JOH	020	008	Then went in also the other disciple, who had come the first to the sepulchre, and saw, and believed.
043	JOH	020	009	Though not even yet had they known the scripture, that he should rise from the dead.
043	JOH	020	010	Then the disciples went back again to their companions.
043	JOH	020	011	But Mary stood at the sepulchre, without, weeping: as therefore she wept, she bent forward towards the sepulchre.
043	JOH	020	012	And saw two angels in white, sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.
043	JOH	020	013	And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.
043	JOH	020	014	And as she thus spoke, she turned about, and beheld Jesus standing by, and knew not that it was Jesus.
043	JOH	020	015	Then Jesus said to her, Woman, why art thou weeping? whom art thou seeking? She, supposing that it was the gardener, said to him, Sir, if thou hast carried him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.
043	JOH	020	016	Jesus saith to her, Mary! Starting round, she said to him, Rabboni! that is, Master!
043	JOH	020	017	Jesus saith to her, Touch me not; for I have not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and tell them, I am ascending to my Father, and your Father; to my God, and your God.
043	JOH	020	018	Mary Magdalen cometh declaring to the disciples, that she had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things to her.
043	JOH	020	019	When the evening therefore was come, on the same first day of the week, and the doors being fastened where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said unto them, Peace be to you.
043	JOH	020	020	And thus speaking, he shewed them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord.
043	JOH	020	021	Jesus therefore spake to them again, Peace be unto you: as the Father hath sent me, even so send I you.
043	JOH	020	022	And so speaking, he breathed on them, and said, Receive the Holy Ghost:
043	JOH	020	023	whose soever sins ye forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins soever ye retain, they are retained.
043	JOH	020	024	Now Thomas, one of the twelve, who is called Didymus, the twin, was not with them when Jesus came.
043	JOH	020	025	Then the other disciples said to him, We have seen the Lord. But he said to them, Except I should see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I shall never believe it.
043	JOH	020	026	And eight days after, his disciples were again within, and Thomas with them: Jesus cometh, though the doors were fastened, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you.
043	JOH	020	027	Afterwards he spake to Thomas, Bring hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and take thy hand, and thrust into my side: and be not incredulous, but a believer.
043	JOH	020	028	And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God!
043	JOH	020	029	Jesus saith to him, Because thou hast seen me, Thomas, hast thou believed: blessed are they who though they have not seen me, yet have believed.
043	JOH	020	030	Now many other miracles did Jesus therefore also in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:
043	JOH	020	031	but these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.
043	JOH	021	001	AFTER these things Jesus again shewed himself to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and he appeared in the following manner:
043	JOH	021	002	Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, the twin, and Nathaniel who was of Cana of Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of the disciples were together.
043	JOH	021	003	Simon Peter said to them, I am going a-fishing. They say to him, We too will go with thee. They went out, and got on board the vessel immediately; and that night they caught nothing.
043	JOH	021	004	But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood upon the beach: yet the disciples had not discovered that it was Jesus.
043	JOH	021	005	Then saith Jesus unto them, My youths, have ye any thing eatable? They answered him, No.
043	JOH	021	006	Then he said to them, Shoot the net on the right side of the vessel, and ye shall find fish. They shot it therefore, and now they were not able to drag it in from the quantity of fishes.
043	JOH	021	007	Then said that disciple whom Jesus loved to Peter, It is the Lord! Then Simon Peter, when he heard that it was the Lord, girt his coat round him, (for he was stripped, ) and threw himself into the sea.
043	JOH	021	008	And the other disciples came in the little vessel, (for they were not far from land, only about two hundred cubits, ) dragging the net with the fishes.
043	JOH	021	009	When therefore they were come to land, they saw a fire laid, and a fish upon it, and a loaf.
043	JOH	021	010	Jesus saith to them, Bring some of the fish which ye have just caught.
043	JOH	021	011	Simon Peter went aboard, and drew the net to land full of large fishes, to the number of a hundred and fifty-three: and though they were so many, yet was not the net rent.
043	JOH	021	012	Jesus saith to them, Come, dine. Now not one of the disciples dared inquire, Who art thou? conscious that it was the Lord.
043	JOH	021	013	Then Jesus cometh, and taketh the loaf, and distributed to them, and of the fish in like manner.
043	JOH	021	014	Now this was the third time Jesus had shewed himself to the disciples, after he rose from the dead.
043	JOH	021	015	When therefore they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith to him, Yes, Lord! thou knowest that I love thee. He saith to him, Feed my lambs.
043	JOH	021	016	He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith to him, Yes, Lord! thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.
043	JOH	021	017	He saith to him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said to him, Lord, thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I love thee! Jesus saith to him, Feed my sheep.
043	JOH	021	018	Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast a younger man, thou didst gird up thyself, and go about whithersoever thy choice led thee: but when thou shalt grow old, another person extending thy hands, shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.
043	JOH	021	019	This he told him, to intimate by what kind of death he should glorify God. And having thus spoken, he said to him, Follow me.
043	JOH	021	020	Now Peter, turning about, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following; who also at the supper reclined on his bosom, and said, Lord, which is the person who betrayeth thee?
043	JOH	021	021	Peter looking at him, saith to Jesus, Lord, and what will become of this man?
043	JOH	021	022	Jesus saith to him, If I will that he abide till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me.
043	JOH	021	023	Then this speech went forth among the disciples, as though this disciple was not to die: yet Jesus had not said to him, That he shall not die; but, If I will that he abide till I come, what is that to thee?
043	JOH	021	024	This is the disciple who is testifing of these things, and hath written these things: and we know that his testimony is true.
043	JOH	021	025	And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if every particular was written, I am of opinion that the world itself would not be capable of retaining the books which should be written. Amen.

# BOOK	044	ACT	Acts	Acts
044	ACT	001	001	THE former treatise, Theophilus, I composed, concerning all things which Jesus began both to do and to teach,
044	ACT	001	002	until that day, when having given a charge to his apostles through the Holy Ghost, whom he had chosen, he was taken up:
044	ACT	001	003	to whom also he had shewed himself alive, after he had suffered, by many infallible proofs, during forty days being frequently seen by them, and speaking of the things which relate to the kingdom of God:
044	ACT	001	004	and assembling them together, commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, said he, ye have heard from me.
044	ACT	001	005	For John indeed baptised with water; but ye shall be baptised with the Holy Ghost not many days after the present.
044	ACT	001	006	They then accordingly assembling together, asked him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time reestablish the kingdom of Israel?
044	ACT	001	007	But he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times and the seasons, which the Father hath reserved under his own authority.
044	ACT	001	008	But ye shall receive power, when the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses for me, both in Jerusalem, and throughout all Judea, and Samaria, and unto the extremity of the earth.
044	ACT	001	009	And as he was speaking these things, while they were looking upon him, he was taken up; and a cloud enveloping him hid him from their eyes.
044	ACT	001	010	And as they looked up earnestly into the heaven, while he was passing, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;
044	ACT	001	011	who also said to them, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up to heaven? this Jesus, who hath been taken up from you into heaven, shall so come, in the same manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.
044	ACT	001	012	Then they returned unto Jerusalem, from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, about a sabbath-day’s journey distant.
044	ACT	001	013	And when they had arrived, they went up to an upper room, where abode Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James son of Alpheus, and Simon the zealous, and Jude brother to James.
044	ACT	001	014	These all persevered unanimously in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.
044	ACT	001	015	And in those days arose Peter in the midst of the disciples, and said, (there was a number of persons together, about an hundred and twenty, )
044	ACT	001	016	Men and brethren, it must needs be that this scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost delivered before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who was the conductor of those who seized on Jesus.
044	ACT	001	017	For he was reckoned of our number, and had obtained an appointment to this ministry.
044	ACT	001	018	This man indeed accordingly purchased a spot of ground with the wages of iniquity; and projected forward, he burst in the midst, and all his bowels fell out.
044	ACT	001	019	And it was a fact known to all who dwelt at Jerusalem; so that this field is called in their own dialect, Aceldama, that is, The field of blood.
044	ACT	001	020	For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let there be no man to dwell in it: and his office, as bishop, let another take.
044	ACT	001	021	Wherefore from among the men who have associated with us always during the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,
044	ACT	001	022	beginning from his baptism by John, until the day in which he was taken up from us, must there be chosen with us a witness of his resurrection, even one of these.
044	ACT	001	023	So they appointed two persons, Joseph called Barsabas, whose sirname was Justus, and Matthias.
044	ACT	001	024	And joining in prayer, they said, Do thou, O Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, point out the one of these two which thou hast chosen,
044	ACT	001	025	to take a part in this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, to go to his own place.
044	ACT	001	026	And they drew lots for them and the lot fell to Matthias and he was by unanimous suffrage numbered with the eleven apostles.
044	ACT	002	001	SO when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with unanimity assembled together.
044	ACT	002	002	And there came suddenly from heaven a sound as it were of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.
044	ACT	002	003	And there was an appearance to them of divided tongues, as of fire, and it rested on every one of them.
044	ACT	002	004	And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them power to express themselves.
044	ACT	002	005	Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem, Jews, men of piety, from every nation under heaven.
044	ACT	002	006	And when this report spread, the multitude collected around them, and were overwhelmed with astonishment, because they heard them speaking every one in his own peculiar dialect.
044	ACT	002	007	And they were all amazed, and wondered, saying one to another, Are not all these who are speaking Galileans?
044	ACT	002	008	And how do we hear every man in our own peculiar dialect, in which from our birth we were brought up?
044	ACT	002	009	Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and they who inhabit Mesopotamia, and Judea, and Cappadocia, Pontus, and Asia,
044	ACT	002	010	and Phrygia, and Pamphylia, Egypt, and the parts of Lybia adjoining Cyrene, and the sojourners, who are Romans, both Jews and proselytes,
044	ACT	002	011	Cretans and Arabians, we hear them speaking in our own several tongues the marvellous things of God.
044	ACT	002	012	And they were all amazed, and much perplexed, and knew not what to think, saying one to another, What can this mean?
044	ACT	002	013	But others scoffing said, These men are brimful of sweet wine.
044	ACT	002	014	But Peter, standing up with the eleven, raised his voice, and addressed them; Men of Judea, and all ye who dwell at Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen to my words:
044	ACT	002	015	for these men are not, as ye suppose, drunk, for it is only the third hour of the day.
044	ACT	002	016	But this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel;
044	ACT	002	017	“And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour our of my spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:
044	ACT	002	018	and upon my servants and my handmaidens in those days will I pour out of my spirit; and they shall prophesy:
044	ACT	002	019	and I will perform prodigies in the heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke.
044	ACT	002	020	The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and illustrious day of the Lord come.
044	ACT	002	021	And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the Lord shall be saved.”
044	ACT	002	022	Men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus the Nazarean, a man from God, pointed out to you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as yourselves also know:
044	ACT	002	023	him, by the destined counsel and foreknowledge of God delivered up, ye have seized, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:
044	ACT	002	024	whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: forasmuch as it was not possible that he should be held thereby.
044	ACT	002	025	For David speaketh concerning him, “I have seen the Lord always before me, for he is at my right hand, that I might not be shaken:
044	ACT	002	026	therefore is my heart full of joy, and my tongue hath exulted; and still shall my flesh also repose in hope,
044	ACT	002	027	that thou wilt not leave my soul in the mansion of the dead, nor permit that Holy One of thine to see corruption.
044	ACT	002	028	Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt fill me with delight by thy countenance.”
044	ACT	002	029	Men and brethren, permit me to speak with freedom to you concerning the patriarch David, that he hath been both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us to this day.
044	ACT	002	030	Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn to him with an oath, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up the Messiah to sit upon his throne;
044	ACT	002	031	he, foreseeing this, spake of the resurrection of the Messiah, that his soul should not be left in the mansion of the dead, and that his flesh should not see corruption.
044	ACT	002	032	This very Jesus hath God raised up, of which we all are witnesses.
044	ACT	002	033	He therefore being exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, hath poured out this, which ye now see and hear.
044	ACT	002	034	For David is not ascended into the heavens: for he saith himself, “The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit on my right hand,
044	ACT	002	035	until I make thine enemies a footstool for thy feet.”
044	ACT	002	036	Let all the house of Israel therefore know assuredly, that God hath made him Lord and Messiah, even that very Jesus whom ye crucified.
044	ACT	002	037	Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart, and said unto Peter and the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?
044	ACT	002	038	Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptised every one of you into the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
044	ACT	002	039	For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off; even as many as the Lord our God shall call.
044	ACT	002	040	And with many other words he testified and exhorted, saying, Be saved from this untoward generation.
044	ACT	002	041	They therefore who gladly received his discourse were baptised: and there were added to them that day about three thousand souls.
044	ACT	002	042	And they persevered stedfastly in the doctrine of the apostles, and in communion, and in breaking bread, and in prayers.
044	ACT	002	043	And on every soul there was an awe: and many miracles and signs were done by the apostles.
044	ACT	002	044	Now all who believed were together, and had all things common;
044	ACT	002	045	and sold their possessions and goods, and divided them among all, as every one had need.
044	ACT	002	046	And daily continuing with one mind at the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they partook of their food with great joy and simplicity of heart,
044	ACT	002	047	praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added the saved ones daily to the church.
044	ACT	003	001	NOW at that time Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth;
044	ACT	003	002	when a certain man who was lame from his mother’s womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple called Beautiful, to ask alms of those who were entering into the temple;
044	ACT	003	003	who seeing Peter and John just going into the temple, asked to receive alms.
044	ACT	003	004	Then Peter fixing his eves stedfastly on him with John, said, Look on us.
044	ACT	003	005	So he attentively regarded them, expecting to receive something from them.
044	ACT	003	006	Then said Peter, I have neither silver nor gold; but what I have, that I give thee: By the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarean, arise, and walk!
044	ACT	003	007	And taking him by the right hand, he raised him up: and immediately his feet and ancles were restored to strength.
044	ACT	003	008	And springing up he stood on his feet, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.
044	ACT	003	009	And all the people beheld him walking and praising God:
044	ACT	003	010	and they took notice of him, that it was the same person who had sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with astonishment and amazed at what had happened to him.
044	ACT	003	011	But as the lame man that was cured held fast Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them into the portico called Solomon’s, in vast amazement.
044	ACT	003	012	Then Peter observing it, addressed himself to the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why gaze ye upon us, as if by our own power or piety we had enabled this man to walk?
044	ACT	003	013	The God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he had determined to release him.
044	ACT	003	014	But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and besought that a man, a murderer, might as a favour be given unto you;
044	ACT	003	015	but ye slew the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead: of which we are witnesses.
044	ACT	003	016	And through faith in his name hath his name restored this man to strength, whom ye behold and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the sight of you all.
044	ACT	003	017	And now, brethren, I know that through ignorance ye did this deed, as did also your rulers.
044	ACT	003	018	But the things which God before announced by the mouth of all his prophets, that Messiah should suffer, he hath thus fulfilled.
044	ACT	003	019	Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when refreshing seasons shall come from the presence of the Lord;
044	ACT	003	020	and he will send Jesus Christ, who was before preached unto you:
044	ACT	003	021	whom the heaven indeed must receive, until the times of restoration of all things, which God hath spoken of by the mouth of all his holy prophets from the beginning of the world.
044	ACT	003	022	For Moses truly said unto the fathers, “A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you from among your brethren, like myself; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall speak to you.
044	ACT	003	023	But it shall come to pass, that every soul which will not hearken to that prophet, shall be utterly exterminated from amidst the people.”
044	ACT	003	024	And all the prophets indeed from Samuel, and those who succeeded him, as many as have spoken, have also foretold those days.
044	ACT	003	025	Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And “in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.”
044	ACT	003	026	Unto you in the first instance, hath God, after raising up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, to the end that every one of you should turn away from your iniquities.
044	ACT	004	001	AND as they were thus speaking, the priests, and the captain of the temple-guard, and the Sadducees, came upon them,
044	ACT	004	002	worn down with vexation, because they taught the people, and preached by Jesus the resurrection of the dead.
044	ACT	004	003	And they laid hands on them, and committed them to prison till the next day: for it was then evening.
044	ACT	004	004	But many of those who heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.
044	ACT	004	005	Now it came to pass that the next morning, their rulers, and elders, and scribes, were assembled at Jerusalem,
044	ACT	004	006	and Annas the high-priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were the high-priest’s relations.
044	ACT	004	007	And placing them in the midst, they interrogated them, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this thing?
044	ACT	004	008	Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,
044	ACT	004	009	if we are this day examined relative to the good deed done to the infirm man, by what means he was restored;
044	ACT	004	010	be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarean, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, by him doth this man stand here sound in your presence.
044	ACT	004	011	This is the stone which, though set at nought by you builders, is become the head of the corner.
044	ACT	004	012	And there is no salvation in any other person: for there is no other name under heaven given unto men, whereby we must be saved.
044	ACT	004	013	Attentively regarding then the noble confidence of Peter and John, and perceiving that they were men unlettered, and destitute of education, they were astonished; and they recollected them, that they had been with Jesus.
044	ACT	004	014	But seeing the man who was healed standing with them, they had not a word to reply in contradiction.
044	ACT	004	015	But bidding them retire out of the council-chamber, they conferred among themselves,
044	ACT	004	016	saying, What shall we do with these men? for that an acknowledged miracle hath been wrought by them is evident to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.
044	ACT	004	017	But that it be no farther spread among the people, we will menace them with threats, no more to speak in this name to any man.
044	ACT	004	018	So calling them in, they charged them not to speak in any manner, nor to teach, in the name of Jesus.
044	ACT	004	019	But Peter and John, answering them, said, If it be right in the sight of God to obey you rather than God, be yourselves the judges.
044	ACT	004	020	For we cannot refrain from speaking the things which we have seen and heard.
044	ACT	004	021	Then they with many additional threatenings dismissed them, finding no pretext how they might punish them, because of the people: for all men glorified God for what had been done.
044	ACT	004	022	For the man was more than forty years of age, upon whom this miracle of healing was performed.
044	ACT	004	023	But they being dismissed, came unto their own friends, and told them all things which the high-priests and elders had said.
044	ACT	004	024	Now when they heard it, they lifted up their united voice to God, and said, Lord, thou art the God which made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all things which are in them:
044	ACT	004	025	who by the mouth of David thy servant saidst, Why do the heathen so furiously rage, and the people meditate vain things?
044	ACT	004	026	The kings of the earth rose up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his Messiah.
044	ACT	004	027	For they have been in truth collected together against thy holy Son Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, even Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the heathen, and the people of Israel,
044	ACT	004	028	to do all that thy hand and thy counsel predestined should come to pass.
044	ACT	004	029	And as to the present transactions, Lord, look upon their threatnings: and grant thy servants power with all boldness to speak thy word,
044	ACT	004	030	by stretching out thy hand for healing; and that signs and miracles may be performed by the name of thy holy child Jesus.
044	ACT	004	031	And while they were praying, the place in which they were assembled was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.
044	ACT	004	032	And in the multitude of those that believed there was one heart and soul: and not one person said, that any part of his substance was his peculiar property; but all things were in common among them.
044	ACT	004	033	And with great power bore the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.
044	ACT	004	034	Neither was there any person in want among them: for as many as were possessors of fields or houses disposed of them, and brought the prices of the things sold,
044	ACT	004	035	and laid them at the apostles’ feet: and a distribution was made to every one according as he had need.
044	ACT	004	036	And Joses, who was surnamed Barnabas by the apostles, (which is, being interpreted, A son of consolation, ) a Levite, a Cyprian by birth,
044	ACT	004	037	having a field belonging to him, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles’ feet.
044	ACT	005	001	NOW a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, had sold an estate,
044	ACT	005	002	and secreted a part of the price paid, his wife also being privy to the transaction, and he brought a part, and laid it at the apostles’ feet.
044	ACT	005	003	But Peter said, O Ananias! why hath Satan filled thy heart that thou shouldst lie to the Holy Ghost, and secrete something from the price of the estate?
044	ACT	005	004	it remained unsold, was it not vested in thee? and when sold, was it not in thine own power? why then hast thou determined in thine heart to do this deed? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.
044	ACT	005	005	Then Ananias, hearing those words, sunk down and expired: and great dread fell upon all who heard these things.
044	ACT	005	006	Then the young men arose, and swathed him up, and carrying him out, buried him.
044	ACT	005	007	Now it came to pass at the distance of about three hours, his wife also, not knowing what had passed, came in.
044	ACT	005	008	And Peter addressed her, Tell me, if ye sold the estate for so much? And she said, Yes, for so much.
044	ACT	005	009	Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have conspired together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? see, the feet of them who have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out.
044	ACT	005	010	Then she fell instantly at his feet, and expired: and the young men entering, found her dead, and carrying her out, buried her with her husband.
044	ACT	005	011	And great awe fell on all the Church, and on all who heard these things.
044	ACT	005	012	But by the hands of the apostles were many signs and miracles done among the people; (and they were all with one accord in the portico of Solomon.
044	ACT	005	013	But of the rest no man had the courage to unite himself with them: though the people extolled them.
044	ACT	005	014	But believers on the Lord were abundantly added to them, multitudes, both of men and women.)
044	ACT	005	015	Insomuch that they carried out into the streets the sick, and laid them on beds and couches, that when Peter was coming by, if but even his shadow might pass over some of them.
044	ACT	005	016	Then came together also a multitude from the neighbouring cities to Jerusalem, bringing the sick, and those who were disturbed by unclean spirits; who were healed universally.
044	ACT	005	017	Then arose the high-priest, and all those who were connected with him, (which was the sect of the Sadducees, ) and were filled with zeal,
044	ACT	005	018	and laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison.
044	ACT	005	019	But the angel of the Lord by night opened the doors of the prison, and conducting them forth, said,
044	ACT	005	020	Go, and taking your station in the temple, speak to the people all the words of this life.
044	ACT	005	021	Having heard this therefore, they entered very early in the morning into the temple, and taught. But when the high-priest came, and those who were with him, they convoked the sanhedrim, and all the assembly of elders of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to bring them.
044	ACT	005	022	But the officers, on their arrival, found them not in the prison: and returning, informed them,
044	ACT	005	023	saying; The prison indeed found we fast locked with all security, and the guards standing without, before the door: but when we opened it, we found no person within.
044	ACT	005	024	Now when they heard these words, both the priest and captain of the temple and the chief priests were in the utmost perplexity concerning these things, what could be the meaning of it.
044	ACT	005	025	Then came a person and informed them, saying, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.
044	ACT	005	026	Then went the captain, with the officers, and brought them; not forcibly, for they were afraid of the people, lest they should stone them.
044	ACT	005	027	But when they had conducted them, they placed them in the sanhedrim: and the high-priest interrogated them,
044	ACT	005	028	saying, Did we not lay our strict injunction upon you, that you should not teach in this name? and, lo, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and would fain bring this man’s blood upon us.
044	ACT	005	029	Then Peter and the apostles answering said, We must obey God rather than men.
044	ACT	005	030	The God of our fathers hath raised up Jesus, whom ye had killed, suspending him on a tree.
044	ACT	005	031	Him hath God exalted at his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance unto Israel, and remission of sins.
044	ACT	005	032	And we are witnesses of these things; and the Holy Ghost also, which God hath given to those who obey him.
044	ACT	005	033	But when they heard this, they were cut asunder as with a saw, and took counsel how to make away with them.
044	ACT	005	034	Then arose a certain Pharisee, in the sanhedrim, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, held in high esteem by all the people, and ordered the apostles to be taken out for a little space;
044	ACT	005	035	and he said unto them, Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves respecting these men, what ye mean to do to them.
044	ACT	005	036	For before these days arose Theudas, saying that he himself was a singular personage: to whom a number of men, about four hundred, attached themselves: who was taken off; and as many as obeyed him, were dispersed, and came to nothing.
044	ACT	005	037	And after him arose Judas the Galilean, in the days of the enrolment, and drew away a multitude of the populace after him: he also perished, and all, as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.
044	ACT	005	038	And as to the matters now before you, I say unto you, Abstain from these men, and leave them to themselves: for if this design or this work be of men, it will come to nothing:
044	ACT	005	039	but if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; and in that case would be found fighters against God.
044	ACT	005	040	And to him they assented: and calling in the apostles, after scourging them, they commanded them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and dismissed them.
044	ACT	005	041	Then they went rejoicing from the presence of the sanhedrim, that for his name’s sake, they had been counted worthy to suffer this injurious treatment.
044	ACT	005	042	And all the day long in the temple, and from house to house, they never ceased teaching and preaching Jesus Christ.
044	ACT	006	001	NOW in those days, when the disciples were multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecian proselytes against the Hebrews, because their widows were overlooked in the daily distribution.
044	ACT	006	002	Then the twelve assembling the multitude of the disciples, said, It is not fit that we should leave the word of God, to make distribution to the tables.
044	ACT	006	003	Therefore, brethren, do ye look out for seven men from among yourselves, the best approved, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint to superintend this business.
044	ACT	006	004	But we will devote ourselves constantly to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.
044	ACT	006	005	And this saying was very agreeable to all the multitude: and they elected Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicholas a proselyte a man of Antioch:
044	ACT	006	006	whom they presented before the apostles: and having prayed, they laid their hands upon them.
044	ACT	006	007	And the word of God increased: and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem was multiplied greatly; and a vast body of the priests were obedient to the faith.
044	ACT	006	008	Now Stephen, full of faith and of power, wrought great miracles and signs among the people.
044	ACT	006	009	Then rose up certain men of the synagogue of the freed-men, and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of those from Cilicia and Asia, disputing with Stephen.
044	ACT	006	010	And they could not resist the wisdom and the spirit with which he spoke.
044	ACT	006	011	Then they suborned men to say, We heard him speak blasphemous things against Moses, and against God.
044	ACT	006	012	And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and coming upon him, they seized him together, and dragged him to the sanhedrim;
044	ACT	006	013	and they set up false witnesses, saying, This man doth not cease speaking blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:
044	ACT	006	014	for we have heard him affirm, that Jesus the Nazarean, even he, will destroy this place, and change the accustomed ordinances which Moses delivered to us.
044	ACT	006	015	And fixing their eyes upon him, all who sat in the sanhedrim, beheld his face as the face of an angel.
044	ACT	007	001	THEN said the high-priest, Are these things so?
044	ACT	007	002	He replied, Men, brethren, and fathers, hear me: The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,
044	ACT	007	003	and said to him, Go forth out of thy country, and from among thy relations, and come hither to a land which I will shew thee.
044	ACT	007	004	Then he went out from the country of the Chaldeans, and, dwelt in Charran: and from thence, after his father was dead, God removed him as a sojourner into this very country, in which we now dwell.
044	ACT	007	005	Yet he gave him no inheritance in it, not so much as the print of his foot: yet he promised to give it for a possession to him and to his seed after him, when he had no son.
044	ACT	007	006	Then spake God to him thus, That his seed should sojourn in a foreign land: and that they should enslave it, and grievously afflict it, four hundred years.
044	ACT	007	007	And the nation by which they shall be enslaved will I judge, said God: and after these things they shall come out, and shall worship me in this place.
044	ACT	007	008	And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so he begat Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac Jacob, and Jacob the twelve patriarchs.
044	ACT	007	009	And the patriarchs, envious, sold Joseph into Egypt: yet God was with him,
044	ACT	007	010	and delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom before Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he appointed him governor over Egypt and all his house.
044	ACT	007	011	Then came a famine upon all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great distress: and our fathers found no provisions.
044	ACT	007	012	But when Jacob heard that there were provisions in Egypt, he sent our fathers, the first time.
044	ACT	007	013	And the second time Joseph was made known unto his brethren; and Joseph’s family was made known unto Pharaoh.
044	ACT	007	014	Then sent Joseph, and invited his father Jacob to come to him, and all his kindred, consisting of seventy-five persons.
044	ACT	007	015	So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, himself, and our fathers,
044	ACT	007	016	and they removed him to Sychem, and laid him in the sepulchre which Abraham had bought, at a price paid in silver, of the sons of Emmor, the father of Shechem.
044	ACT	007	017	But as the time of the promise which God had with an oath confirmed unto Abraham drew nigh, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt,
044	ACT	007	018	until another king arose, who knew not Joseph.
044	ACT	007	019	This man, forming crafty designs against our nation, grievously treated our fathers, so as to cause them to expose their children, in order to exterminate the race.
044	ACT	007	020	At which time Moses was born, and was endued with singular beauty from God, who was brought up three months in the house of his father:
044	ACT	007	021	and when he was exposed, Pharaoh’s daughter took him home, and brought him up for herself, as a son.
044	ACT	007	022	And Moses was educated in all the wisdom of Egypt, and was mighty in words and actions.
044	ACT	007	023	But when he had completed his fortieth year, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel.
044	ACT	007	024	And seeing one of them treated injuriously, he defended him, and executed vengeance for him who had suffered the outrage, smiting the Egyptian.
044	ACT	007	025	For he thought that his brethren would understand that God by his hand would give them deliverance: but they understood not.
044	ACT	007	026	And the following day he shewed himself to them as they were fighting, and urged them to peace, saying, My friends, ye are brethren; wherefore do ye ill treat one another?
044	ACT	007	027	Then he who did his neighbour wrong thrust him from him, saying, Who appointed thee a ruler and a judge over us?
044	ACT	007	028	Wilt thou kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian yesterday?
044	ACT	007	029	Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a sojourner in the land of Midian, where he begat two sons.
044	ACT	007	030	And when forty years were completed, there appeared to him in the desert of mount Sinai the angel of the Lord, in a flame of fire in a bush.
044	ACT	007	031	But when Moses saw it, he marvelled at the sight: and as he was drawing nearer to observe it, a voice from the Lord came to him,
044	ACT	007	032	“I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” Then Moses trembling, dared not to look farther.
044	ACT	007	033	Then the Lord said unto him, “Loose the sandal from thy feet: for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.
044	ACT	007	034	Attentive I have beheld the evil treatment of my people in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and I am come down to deliver them. And now come hither, I will send thee into Egypt.”
044	ACT	007	035	This very Moses whom they had rejected, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and redeemer by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush.
044	ACT	007	036	He brought them forth, after performing miracles and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years.
044	ACT	007	037	This is the Moses who said unto the children of Israel, “A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up for you from among your brethren, as myself; him shall ye hear.”
044	ACT	007	038	This is he, who was with the church in the wilderness with the angel who spake to him in the mount Sinai, and with our fathers: who received the oracles of life to give unto us:
044	ACT	007	039	to whom our fathers would not be obedient, but thrust him from them, and turned back in their hearts unto Egypt,
044	ACT	007	040	saying to Aaron, Make us gods who shall go before us: for this Moses, who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what hath happened to him.
044	ACT	007	041	And they made a calf in those days, and brought a sacrifice for the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.
044	ACT	007	042	Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, Have ye offered me slain beasts and sacrifices forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?
044	ACT	007	043	Yet have ye taken up the tabernacle of Moloc, and the star of your god Remphan, those figures which ye made to pay adoration to them: and I will transport you beyond Babylon.
044	ACT	007	044	The tabernacle of the testimony was with our fathers in the wilderness, as he that spake to Moses commanded, that he should make it according to the model which he had seen.
044	ACT	007	045	Which also our fathers having received, brought in with Joshua into the place possessed by the Gentiles, whom God drove out from before the presence of our fathers, unto the days of David;
044	ACT	007	046	who found favour before God, and sought to procure an habitation for the God of Jacob.
044	ACT	007	047	But Solomon built an house for him.
044	ACT	007	048	Though the Most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as the prophet saith,
044	ACT	007	049	“Heaven is my throne, and earth the footstool for my feet: what kind of house will ye build me? saith the Lord: or what place is there for my repose?
044	ACT	007	050	hath not my hand made all these things?”
044	ACT	007	051	Ye stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and in ears, ye do always oppose yourselves against the Holy Ghost: as your fathers, so are ye.
044	ACT	007	052	Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they killed those who before published the tidings of the coming of that Righteous Person; of whom ye have now been the betrayers and murderers:
044	ACT	007	053	who have received the law through arrangements of angels, yet have not observed it.
044	ACT	007	054	Now when they heard these things, they were cut through their hearts as with a saw, and gnashed upon him with their teeth.
044	ACT	007	055	But he being full of the Holy Ghost, and looking up stedfastly to heaven, saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God;
044	ACT	007	056	and he said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God.
044	ACT	007	057	Then they screamed out with a great cry, and stopped their ears, and rushed all together upon him,
044	ACT	007	058	and dragging him out of the city, stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man, named Saul.
044	ACT	007	059	And they stoned Stephen, in the act of prayer, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!
044	ACT	007	060	Then falling on his knees, he cried with a loud voice, Lord, impute not to them this sin! And thus speaking, fell asleep.
044	ACT	008	001	BUT Saul was delighted with his execution. Now on that very day commenced a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and all, besides the apostles, were dispersed through the regions of Judea and Samaria.
044	ACT	008	002	Then some pious men assembling, carried Stephen to his grave, and made great lamentation over him.
044	ACT	008	003	But Saul ravaged the church, entering into the houses, and dragging men and women, cast them into prison.
044	ACT	008	004	Those therefore who were dispersed, travelled through the country, preaching the word.
044	ACT	008	005	But Philip, going down to a city of Samaria, preached Christ unto them.
044	ACT	008	006	And the multitudes with united minds were very attentive to the things spoken by Philip, when they heard him, and saw the miracles which he did.
044	ACT	008	007	For the unclean spirits, roaring with great cries, came forth out of many who were possessed: and many who were paralytic and lame were healed.
044	ACT	008	008	And there was great joy in that city.
044	ACT	008	009	But a certain man, named Simon, lived previously in that city, who practised magic, and astonished the nation of Samaria, giving out himself as an extraordinary great personage:
044	ACT	008	010	to whom all gave heed from the small to the great, saying, This man is the great power of God.
044	ACT	008	011	And to him they attended, because he had of a considerable time astonished them by his magical tricks.
044	ACT	008	012	But when they believed Philip, who preached the glad tidings of the things which related to the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptised both men and women.
044	ACT	008	013	Then Simon also himself believed: and being baptised, he attached himself to Philip, and beholding the signs and great miracles which were performed, he was astonished.
044	ACT	008	014	But when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:
044	ACT	008	015	who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:
044	ACT	008	016	for as yet he had not fallen on any one of them: only they had been baptised into the name of the Lord Jesus.
044	ACT	008	017	Then they laid their hands upon them, and they received the Holy Ghost.
044	ACT	008	018	Now when Simon saw, that by the imposition of the apostles’ hands, the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,
044	ACT	008	019	saying, Confer on me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay my hands, they may receive the Holy Ghost.
044	ACT	008	020	But Peter said unto him, May thy silver with thyself go into perdition, because thou hast imagined that the gift of God can be purchased with money.
044	ACT	008	021	There is for thee neither part nor lot in this word: for thy heart is not right before God.
044	ACT	008	022	Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray to God, if haply this thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee.
044	ACT	008	023	For I see that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and the bond of iniquity.
044	ACT	008	024	Then Simon answering said, Pray ye for me unto the Lord, that none of the things which ye have spoken may come upon me.
044	ACT	008	025	Then they, after bearing their testimony, and speaking the word of the Lord, returned towards Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.
044	ACT	008	026	Now the angel of the Lord spake to Philip, saying, Arise, and go towards the south, on the road which leads down from Jerusalem to Gaza: it is a wilderness.
044	ACT	008	027	And he arose and went: and lo! an Ethiopian man, an eunuch, a person in power under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasury; he had gone to worship unto Jerusalem,
044	ACT	008	028	and was returning, and sitting in his chariot, was reading the prophet Isaiah.
044	ACT	008	029	Then said the Spirit to Philip, Go up, and approach close to that chariot.
044	ACT	008	030	Then Philip running up to him, heard him reading the prophet Isaiah; and he said, Well! but dost thou understand what thou art reading?
044	ACT	008	031	He replied, How indeed can I, except some person guide me in the way? And he besought Philip to come up and sit with him.
044	ACT	008	032	The portion of scripture which he had been reading was this: “He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and as a lamb before him who sheareth it is dumb, so he opened not his mouth:
044	ACT	008	033	in his humiliation his judgment was taken away: but his generation who can describe? for his life was taken away from the earth.”
044	ACT	008	034	Then the eunuch addressing himself to Philip, said, I pray thee, of whom doth the prophet thus speak? of himself, or of some other person?
044	ACT	008	035	Then Philip opening his mouth, and beginning from that scripture, preached to him Jesus.
044	ACT	008	036	But as they went on the road, they came to some water: and the eunuch said, Here is water, what forbids my being baptised?
044	ACT	008	037	And Philip said, If thou believest with the whole heart, it is allowable. Then he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
044	ACT	008	038	And he bid the carriage stop: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptised him.
044	ACT	008	039	But when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught up Philip, and the eunuch saw him no more: then he went on his way rejoicing.
044	ACT	008	040	But Philip found himself at Azotus: and passing through he preached the gospel in all the cities, until he came to Caesarea.
044	ACT	009	001	BUT Saul, still breathing out threatenings and murder against the disciples of the Lord, applying to the high-priest,
044	ACT	009	002	besought of him letters for the synagogues at Damascus, that if he should find any persons of this way, whether men or women, he might bring them in chains to Jerusalem.
044	ACT	009	003	So advancing on his journey, he was drawing nigh to Damascus: and suddenly there shone around him a light from heaven:
044	ACT	009	004	and falling on the ground, he heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
044	ACT	009	005	Then said he, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou art persecuting: It is difficult for thee to kick against the goads.
044	ACT	009	006	And trembling and amazed he said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.
044	ACT	009	007	And the men who travelled with him stood astonished, hearing indeed a voice, but seeing no man.
044	ACT	009	008	Then Paul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but leading him by the hand, they brought him into Damascus.
044	ACT	009	009	And he was three days seeing nothing, and did neither eat nor drink.
044	ACT	009	010	Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias; and the Lord said unto him in a vision, Ananias! And he said, Here I am, Lord.
044	ACT	009	011	Then the Lord said to him, Arise, go into the street called Strait, and inquire at the house of Judas for one named Saul a man of Tarsus: for, behold, he is praying,
044	ACT	009	012	and hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming to him, and laying his hand upon him, that he may recover his sight.
044	ACT	009	013	But Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many of this man, how many evils he hath inflicted on thy saints at Jerusalem:
044	ACT	009	014	and here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call upon thy name.
044	ACT	009	015	But the Lord said unto him, Go: for this man is an elect vessel for me, to bear my name before nations, and kings, and the children of Israel:
044	ACT	009	016	for I will shew him how many things he must suffer for my name’s sake.
044	ACT	009	017	Then went Ananias, and entered into the house; and laying his hands upon him, said, Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who was seen by thee in the way that thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest recover thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.
044	ACT	009	018	And directly there fell from his eyes as it were scales: and he recovered sight instantly, and arose, and was baptised.
044	ACT	009	019	And when he had taken nourishment, he regained his strength. And Saul continued with the disciples who were at Damascus several days.
044	ACT	009	020	And immediately he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.
044	ACT	009	021	And all who heard him were amazed, and said, Is not this the man who made havoc at Jerusalem, among those who called on this name? and hither he came for this purpose, that he might carry them in chains unto the chief priests?
044	ACT	009	022	But Saul was endued with still greater power, and confounded the Jews who dwelt at Damascus, conclusively evincing that this person is the Messiah.
044	ACT	009	023	But when many days were fulfilled, the Jews consulted together how to kill him:
044	ACT	009	024	but their design was discovered to Saul. And they kept guard at the gates of the city day and night, that they might kill him.
044	ACT	009	025	But the disciples taking him by night, got him off through the wall, letting him down in a basket.
044	ACT	009	026	But when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he attempted to join the disciples: and they were all afraid of him, not crediting that he was a disciple.
044	ACT	009	027	Then Barnabas taking him by the hand, brought him to the apostles, and related to them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how boldly he had preached at Damascus in the name of Jesus.
044	ACT	009	028	And he was with them coming in, and going out at Jerusalem:
044	ACT	009	029	and speaking boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus. And he talked and disputed with the Grecian proselytes: but they made an attempt to murder him.
044	ACT	009	030	Then the brethren, when they knew it brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him off to Tarsus.
044	ACT	009	031	Then had the churches peace through all Judea and Galilee and Samaria, being edified; and walking in the fear of God, and in the consolation of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.
044	ACT	009	032	Now it came to pass, as Peter was passing through all parts, that he went down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda.
044	ACT	009	033	And found there a certain man named AEneas, during six years stretched on a bed, who was paralytic.
044	ACT	009	034	And Peter said to him, AEneas, Jesus the Messiah maketh thee whole: arise, and make thine own bed. And he arose immediately.
044	ACT	009	035	And all who dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and they turned to the Lord.
044	ACT	009	036	But there was at Joppa a woman, a disciple, named Tabitha, (which by interpretation is called Dorcas: ) this woman was full of good works and of alms which she did.
044	ACT	009	037	But it came to pass that in those days she sickened and died: having then washed her, they laid her out in an upper room.
044	ACT	009	038	And as Lydda was near to Joppa, the disciples hearing that Peter was there, sent two men to him, entreating him without delay to come over to them.
044	ACT	009	039	Then Peter arose and went with them. And they carried him, on his arrival, into the upper room: and all the widows stood round him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas had made, whilst she was with them.
044	ACT	009	040	But Peter putting them all out, fell upon his knees, and prayed; and turning to the body, said, Tabitha, arise! And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.
044	ACT	009	041	Then he gave her his hand, and raised her up; and calling in the saints and the widows, presented her to them alive.
044	ACT	009	042	And it was known through all Joppa; and many believed on the Lord.
044	ACT	009	043	Then it came to pass, that he abode many days at Joppa with one Simon a tanner.
044	ACT	010	001	NOW there was a man at Caesarea named Cornelius, a centurion of the cohort called the Italic,
044	ACT	010	002	a man of piety, and who feared God with all his house, giving much alms to the people, and praying to God continually.
044	ACT	010	003	He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming to him, and saying to him, Cornelius.
044	ACT	010	004	Then looking stedfastly on him, and being terrified, he said, What means this, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.
044	ACT	010	005	And now send men to Joppa, and inquire for Simon, who is surnamed Peter:
044	ACT	010	006	he lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is near the sea: this man will tell thee what thou must do.
044	ACT	010	007	But when the angel departed who spake to Cornelius, he called two of his domestics, and a pious soldier, persons who constantly were in attendance upon him;
044	ACT	010	008	and relating all things to them, sent them to Joppa.
044	ACT	010	009	Then the next morning, as they were on their journey, and drew near to the city, Peter went up to the flat roof to pray about the sixth hour:
044	ACT	010	010	and he grew very hungry, and desired something to eat: but whilst they were getting it ready, a sacred ecstacy fell upon him.
044	ACT	010	011	And he saw heaven opened, and there descended to him a certain vessel, as a great sheet with chains at the four corners, and resting upon the earth:
044	ACT	010	012	in which were all the quadrupeds of the earth, and wild beasts, and reptiles, and birds of the air.
044	ACT	010	013	And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; slay and eat.
044	ACT	010	014	But Peter said, By no means, Lord for I have never at any time eaten of any thing common or unclean.
044	ACT	010	015	And the voice again a second time came to him, What God hath cleansed, call not thou unclean.
044	ACT	010	016	This was thrice repeated: and the vessel was again taken up into heaven.
044	ACT	010	017	But while Peter was perplexed in himself what was meant by the vision which he had seen, then, behold! the men which had been sent by Cornelius having inquired out the house of Simon, stood before the door,
044	ACT	010	018	and calling, asked if Simon, surnamed Peter, lodged there.
044	ACT	010	019	But while Peter was musing upon the vision, the Spirit said to him, Lo! three men are inquiring after thee.
044	ACT	010	020	Arise then, and go down, and go with them, entertaining no doubt, for I have sent them.
044	ACT	010	021	Then Peter went down to the men who were sent by Cornelius to him; and said, Lo! I am the person that ye ask for: what is the business on which ye are come hither?
044	ACT	010	022	Then they said, Cornelius a centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report with all the nation of the Jews, has been divinely admonished by a holy angel to send for thee to his house, to hear words from thee.
044	ACT	010	023	Then inviting them in, he lodged them there. And the next morning Peter went with them, and some of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him.
044	ACT	010	024	And the next day they entered into Caesarea. Now Cornelius was expecting them, having called together his relations and nearest friends.
044	ACT	010	025	And as Peter was entering, Cornelius met him, and falling at his feet, paid him homage.
044	ACT	010	026	But Peter raised him up, saying, Arise; I also myself am a man.
044	ACT	010	027	And conversing with him, he entered, and found many assembled together.
044	ACT	010	028	And he said unto them, Ye know how contrary it is to established usage, for a man who is a Jew to associate with or visit one of another nation; but God hath shewed me to call no man common or unclean.
044	ACT	010	029	Wherefore also without a word, I came when invited: I beg to know therefore for what purpose ye have sent for me?
044	ACT	010	030	Then Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting till this hour; and at the ninth hour I was praying in my house, and, lo! a man stood before me in shining apparel,
044	ACT	010	031	and said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thy alms are remembered before God.
044	ACT	010	032	Send therefore to Joppa, and invite Simon, whose surname is Peter, to come to thee; he lodgeth in the house of Simon the tanner, near the sea: who, when he is come will talk with thee.
044	ACT	010	033	Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast done well in coming. Now therefore are all we here present before God, to hear all things that are given in charge to thee from God.
044	ACT	010	034	Then Peter opening his mouth, said, In truth I perceive that God is not a respecter of persons:
044	ACT	010	035	but in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is acceptable to him.
044	ACT	010	036	The word which he sent to the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ, (he is Lord of all, ) ye know:
044	ACT	010	037	even that which was the common talk through all Judea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;
044	ACT	010	038	respecting Jesus, who was of Nazareth, how God had anointed him with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were tyrannically oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.
044	ACT	010	039	And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the region of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they killed suspending him on a tree:
044	ACT	010	040	him God raised up the third day, and ordained that he should be visibly manifested;
044	ACT	010	041	not to all the people, but to witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he was arisen from the dead.
044	ACT	010	042	And hath commanded us to proclaim to the people, and to bear our testimony that this is the person who is ordained of God the Judge of the living and the dead.
044	ACT	010	043	To him bear all the prophets witness, that through his name every one who believeth in him, shall receive remission of sins.
044	ACT	010	044	While Peter was yet speaking these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all who heard the discourse.
044	ACT	010	045	And they of the circumcision who were believers, as many as came with Peter, were amazed, because even on the Gentiles the gift of the holy Ghost was poured out.
044	ACT	010	046	For they heard them speaking in different languages, and magnifying God. Then Peter addressed them,
044	ACT	010	047	Can any one forbid the water for baptising these persons, who have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?
044	ACT	010	048	So he commanded them to be baptised in the name of the Lord. Then they entreated him to tarry there some days.
044	ACT	011	001	NOW the apostles and brethren who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.
044	ACT	011	002	And when Peter went up to Jerusalem, they of the circumcision disputed with him,
044	ACT	011	003	saying, Thou hast gone in to men holding uncircumcision, and hast eaten with them.
044	ACT	011	004	Then Peter taking up the matter from the beginning, explained it to them regularly, saying,
044	ACT	011	005	I was in the city of Joppa praying and I saw in a trance a vision, a certain vessel descending as a vast sheet let down from heaven by its four corners; and it came close to me:
044	ACT	011	006	on which looking attentively, I perceived, and saw the quadrupeds of the earth, and the wild beasts, and the reptiles, and the birds of the air.
044	ACT	011	007	Then I heard a voice saying to me, Rise, Peter; slay and eat.
044	ACT	011	008	But I said, By no means, Lord: for never yet hath any thing common or unclean entered into my mouth.
044	ACT	011	009	But the voice replied the second time from heaven, What God hath cleansed, call not thou common.
044	ACT	011	010	Now this was repeated thrice: and the whole withdrawn again into heaven.
044	ACT	011	011	And, lo! immediately three men stood before the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me.
044	ACT	011	012	And the Spirit bade me go with them, making no hesitation. But with me went also these six brethren, and we entered into the man’s house:
044	ACT	011	013	and he informed us how he had seen an angel in his house, standing and saying to him, Send men to Joppa, and invite Simon, who is surnamed Peter;
044	ACT	011	014	who will speak words to thee, by which thou mayest be saved, and thy house.
044	ACT	011	015	So when I had begun to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, just as on us at the beginning.
044	ACT	011	016	Then I recollected the word of the Lord, how he had said, John indeed baptised with water; but ye shall be baptised with the Holy Ghost.
044	ACT	011	017	If God then gave an equal gift to them even as to us, on believing on the Lord Jesus Christ; I, indeed, who was I, that I should be able to restrain God?
044	ACT	011	018	So when they heard these things they were satisfied, and glorified God, saying, Well! then hath God even to the Gentiles given repentance unto life.
044	ACT	011	019	Now those also who were dispersed by the persecution which arose on account of Stephen passed on as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to no man except the Jews only.
044	ACT	011	020	And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they arrived at Antioch, spake to the Grecian proselytes, preaching the Lord Jesus.
044	ACT	011	021	And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a vast multitude believing, turned to the Lord.
044	ACT	011	022	And the report concerning them was heard in the ears of the church which was at Jerusalem: and they dispatched Barnabas, to go as far as Antioch.
044	ACT	011	023	Who, when he arrived there, and beheld the grace of God, rejoiced, and exhorted them all, with full purpose of heart to adhere to the Lord.
044	ACT	011	024	For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and a great multitude was added to the Lord.
044	ACT	011	025	Then went forth Barnabas to Tarsus, in search of Saul:
044	ACT	011	026	and having found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it came to pass, that during a whole year they were jointly employed in that church, and taught a vast multitude, and they called for the first time in Antioch the disciples Christians.
044	ACT	011	027	Now there came down in those days prophets from Jerusalem to Antioch.
044	ACT	011	028	And one of them named Agabus, rising up, signified by the spirit that a great famine was coming upon the whole habitable globe: which also came in the reign of Claudius Caesar.
044	ACT	011	029	Then the disciples, as everyman had ability, determined every individual of them to send a sum to be distributed among the brethren who dwelt in Judea:
044	ACT	011	030	which also they did, sending it off to the presbyters by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.
044	ACT	012	001	NOW at that time Herod the king stretched forth his hand to treat cruelly certain persons belonging to the church.
044	ACT	012	002	And he slew James the brother of John with a sword.
044	ACT	012	003	And seeing how agreeable this was to the Jews, he proceeded to seize Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)
044	ACT	012	004	Whom having apprehended, he put him in prison, delivering him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep guard over him; intending after the Passover to bring him forth to the people for execution.
044	ACT	012	005	So then Peter was kept in prison: but fervent prayer was offered up by the church to God for him.
044	ACT	012	006	Now when Herod was going to bring him forth, the same night was Peter fast asleep between the two soldiers, fastened to them with two chains: and the guards before the door kept the prison.
044	ACT	012	007	And, lo! an angel of the Lord stood there, and light glared through the apartment: then with a stroke on Peter’s side, he roused him up, and said, Arise quickly. And his chains fell from his hands.
044	ACT	012	008	And the angel said to him, Gird thyself up, and bind on thy sandals. And he did so. And he said unto him, Wrap thyself in thy mantle, and follow me.
044	ACT	012	009	And going out, he followed him; and knew not that it was a reality which was done by the angel; but he supposed he saw a vision.
044	ACT	012	010	So passing through the first ward and the second, they came to the iron door which leads into the city, which opened to them spontaneously: and being come out, they walked forward through one street; and immediately the angel departed from him.
044	ACT	012	011	And Peter coming to himself, said, Now I know assuredly, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me from the hand of Herod, and all the eager expectation of the people of the Jews.
044	ACT	012	012	And after considering with himself, he went to the house of Mary the mother of John, who is surnamed Mark; where many were thronged together, and praying.
044	ACT	012	013	Peter then knocking at the door of the gatetway, there came a damsel to ask who was there, named Rhoda.
044	ACT	012	014	And well knowing Peter’s voice, she opened not the door for joy; but running in, told that Peter was standing before the door.
044	ACT	012	015	But they said, Thou art raving. But she confidently persisted that it was so. Then they said, It is his angel.
044	ACT	012	016	But Peter continued knocking: and they opened the door and saw him, and were astonished.
044	ACT	012	017	Then beckoning with the hand that they should be silent, he informed them in what manner the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Tell James and the brethren these things. And departing thence he went into another place.
044	ACT	012	018	Now when the day broke, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what could possibly become of Peter.
044	ACT	012	019	And Herod sought him out earnestly, but not being able to find him, after having examined the guards strictly, he commanded them to be executed. And going down from Jerusalem to Caesarea, took up his abode there.
044	ACT	012	020	Now Herod was fiercely bent on war against the Tyrians and Sidonians: but they presented themselves unanimously before him, and ingratiating themselves with Blastus who was over the king’s bedchamber, they begged for peace; because their country received all their supply of provisions from the king’s territories.
044	ACT	012	021	Then on a day appointed, Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, and seated on his throne, made an harangue unto them.
044	ACT	012	022	And the populace shouted, It is the voice of a god, and not a man.
044	ACT	012	023	But instantly the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not the glory to God: and being devoured with worms, he expired.
044	ACT	012	024	But the word of the Lord increased, and was widely diffused.
044	ACT	012	025	Then Barnabas and Saul departed from Jerusalem, having completed the distribution of the sum entrusted with them; and they took with them John, whose surname was Mark.
044	ACT	013	001	NOW there were at Antioch, according to the established church, prophets and teachers; such as Barnabas, and Simeon called Niger the black, and Lucius a Cyrenian, and Manaen, Herod the tetrarch’s foster-brother, and Saul.
044	ACT	013	002	And as they were employed in the ministry, and kept a fast, the Holy Ghost said, Set apart for me now both Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.
044	ACT	013	003	Then having kept a fast and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them out.
044	ACT	013	004	They then being sent forth indeed by the Holy Ghost, went down to Seleucia; and from thence sailed to Cyprus.
044	ACT	013	005	And being at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had John also as their attendant.
044	ACT	013	006	Now as they travelled through the island as far as Paphos, they found a certain person who professed magic, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar-jesus:
044	ACT	013	007	who was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man; he inviting to his house Barnabas and Saul, desired earnestly to hear the word of God.
044	ACT	013	008	But Elymas the magician (for such is his name when interpreted) opposed them, seeking to pervert the proconsul from the faith.
044	ACT	013	009	Then Saul (now Paul), filled with the Holy Ghost, and fixing his eyes upon him,
044	ACT	013	010	said, O thou full of all guile and all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease perverting the strait ways of the Lord?
044	ACT	013	011	And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, seeing the sun no more for a season. And instantly there fell on him a thick mist and darkness; and groping about he sought some to lead him by the hand.
044	ACT	013	012	Then when the proconsul saw what was done, he believed, being struck with the doctrine of the Lord.
044	ACT	013	013	Hereupon sailing from Paphos, they who were about Paul came to Perga in Pamphylia: but John departing from them returned to Jerusalem.
044	ACT	013	014	And they departed from Perga, and came to Antioch in Pisidia, and entering into the synagogue on the sabbath-day, they sat down.
044	ACT	013	015	Then after the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogues sent to them, saying, Men and brethren, if ye are disposed to give a word of exhortation to the people, speak.
044	ACT	013	016	Then Paul arose, and waving his hand, said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, hear me.
044	ACT	013	017	The God of this people Israel selected our fathers, and exalted the people during their abode in the land of Egypt, and with a mighty arm brought he them out of it.
044	ACT	013	018	And about the space of forty years he bore with their behaviour in the wilderness.
044	ACT	013	019	And destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan, he distributed their territory to them by lot.
044	ACT	013	020	And after these things, during a space of about four hundred and fifty years, he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.
044	ACT	013	021	And from that time they desired a king: and God gave them Saul the son of Kis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, during forty years.
044	ACT	013	022	And removing him, he raised up unto them David to be king; respecting whom also he spake testifying, “I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after my own heart, who shall perform all my intentions.”
044	ACT	013	023	From this man’s seed according to the promise hath God raised up to Israel a Saviour, Jesus:
044	ACT	013	024	John having preached before his first coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
044	ACT	013	025	But as John was finishing his course, he said, Whom do ye suppose me to be? I am not the Messiah. But, behold! he is coming after me, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to loose.
044	ACT	013	026	Men and brethren, children of the race of Abraham, and all among you who fear God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.
044	ACT	013	027	For they who dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, being ignorant of him, and the words of the prophets that are read every sabbath-day, by condemning him have fulfilled them.
044	ACT	013	028	And though they found no cause of death in him, they besought Pilate that he might be killed.
044	ACT	013	029	But when they had finished all things that were written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre.
044	ACT	013	030	But God raised him from the dead:
044	ACT	013	031	and he was seen many days by those who went up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses to the people.
044	ACT	013	032	And we preach to you the promise made to our fathers;
044	ACT	013	033	for this hath God fulfilled to their children, even to us, in raising up Jesus: as it is also written in the second Psalm, “Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.”
044	ACT	013	034	But that he raised him from the dead, no more in future to return to corruption, he hath thus spoken, “I will give you the holy things of David, which are sure.”
044	ACT	013	035	Wherefore also he saith in another place, “Thou wilt not permit thy Holy One to see corruption.”
044	ACT	013	036	For David indeed, after having served his own generation by the will of God, fell asleep, and was placed with his fathers, and saw corruption.
044	ACT	013	037	But he, whom God raised up, saw no corruption.
044	ACT	013	038	Be it therefore known unto you, men and brethren, that through this man remission of sin is proclaimed to you:
044	ACT	013	039	and by this man shall every one who believeth be justified from all things, from which it was not possible that he should be justified by the law of Moses.
044	ACT	013	040	Take heed then, that this come not upon you, which is spoken by the prophets;
044	ACT	013	041	“Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I do a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though one declare it unto you.”
044	ACT	013	042	But when the Jews were going out of the synagogue, the Gentiles entreated that these words might be spoken to them the following sabbath.
044	ACT	013	043	And when the synagogue was dismissed, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, exhorting them, persuaded them to abide stedfast in the grace of God.
044	ACT	013	044	And on the next sabbath almost all the city thronged together to hear the word of God.
044	ACT	013	045	But the Jews seeing the multitude, were filled with envy, and opposed the things spoken by Paul, contradicting and reviling.
044	ACT	013	046	Then Paul and Barnabas speaking with undaunted boldness, said, It was necessary that the word of God should be first spoken unto you: but since ye have thrust it from you, and judged yourselves not worthy of eternal life, lo! we turn to the Gentiles.
044	ACT	013	047	For so hath the Lord enjoined us, “I have set thee for a light of the Gentiles, that thou mightest be for salvation unto the extremity of the earth.”
044	ACT	013	048	Now when the Gentiles heard this, they rejoiced, and glorified the word of the Lord: and they believed, even as many as were ordained to life eternal.
044	ACT	013	049	So the word of the Lord was diffused through the whole region.
044	ACT	013	050	Then the Jews stirred up the devout women, and those who were respectable, and the principal persons of the city, and raised up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and cast them out of their borders.
044	ACT	013	051	But they, shaking off the dust of their feet against them, came to Iconium.
044	ACT	013	052	And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost.
044	ACT	014	001	NOW it came to pass at Iconium, that they went together into the synagogue of the Jews, and spake in such a manner, as that a vast multitude both of the Jews and Greek proselytes believed.
044	ACT	014	002	But the unbelieving Jews stirred up, and maliciously prejudiced the spirits of the Gentiles against the brethren.
044	ACT	014	003	A long space therefore continued they there speaking boldly in the Lord, who bore witness to the word of his grace, and granted signs and miracles to be wrought by their hands.
044	ACT	014	004	So the multitude was divided: some indeed were with the Jews, but others with the apostles.
044	ACT	014	005	And when there was a strong effort made both by the Gentiles and Jews with their rulers to ill-treat and stone them,
044	ACT	014	006	conscious of their danger, they fled unto the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra, and Derbe, and the circum-jacent country:
044	ACT	014	007	and there they preached the gospel.
044	ACT	014	008	And there was a certain man at Lystra, who having lost the use of his feet was sitting, being lame from his mother’s womb, and who had never been able to walk:
044	ACT	014	009	this person heard Paul speaking; who fixing his eyes on him, and discovering that he had faith to be healed,
044	ACT	014	010	said with a loud voice, Stand up firm on thy feet! And he leaped and walked.
044	ACT	014	011	But when the multitudes beheld what Paul had done, they lifted up their voice, in the dialect of Lycaonia, saying, The gods in the form of mortals are come down to us.
044	ACT	014	012	And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercury, because he principally led the discourse.
044	ACT	014	013	Then the priest of Jupiter, who was the presiding deity of their city, brought bulls and garlands unto the gates of the city, and intended to offer a sacrifice with the people.
044	ACT	014	014	But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard it, they rent their garments, and rushed into the crowd, crying out,
044	ACT	014	015	and saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We too are mortals subject to the same infirmities with you; preaching to you the gospel, that ye should turn from these vain things unto the living God, who made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things which are therein:
044	ACT	014	016	who in the past generations hath suffered all nations to walk in their own ways.
044	ACT	014	017	Although indeed he left not himself untestified of, doing us good, giving us from heaven showers, and fruitful seasons, replenishing our hearts with food and gladness.
044	ACT	014	018	And thus speaking, scarce restrained they the multitudes from offering the sacrifice to them.
044	ACT	014	019	Then came the Jews from Antioch and Iconium, and gaining over the multitudes, they stoned Paul, and dragged him out of the city, supposing him to be dead.
044	ACT	014	020	But as the disciples stood around him, he arose, and entered into the city: and on the morrow he departed with Barnabas for Derbe.
044	ACT	014	021	And after preaching the gospel in that city, and bringing many to become disciples, they returned to Lystra, and Iconium, and Antioch;
044	ACT	014	022	strengthening the souls of the brethren, exhorting them to abide firm in the faith, and that through many afflictions we must pass into the kingdom of heaven.
044	ACT	014	023	Then appointing them presbyters in every city, by prayer with fastings they commended them to the Lord, on whom they had believed.
044	ACT	014	024	Then passing through Pisidia, they came unto Pamphylia.
044	ACT	014	025	And having spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia:
044	ACT	014	026	and thence sailed for Antioch, from whence they had been commended to the grace of God for the service which they had performed.
044	ACT	014	027	So when they arrived they called the church together, and related what great things God had done by them, and that he had opened to the heathen the door of faith.
044	ACT	014	028	And there they abode no inconsiderable time with the disciples.
044	ACT	015	001	AND certain persons coming down from Judea taught the brethren, That if ye are not circumcised according to the ordinances of Moses, ye cannot be saved.
044	ACT	015	002	There being therefore no small contention and dispute maintained by Paul and Barnabas against them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain others of their body, should go up to the apostles and presbyters at Jerusalem, for the decision of this question.
044	ACT	015	003	They therefore being sent on their way by the church, passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, giving a particular narrative of the conversion of the Gentiles: and they gave great joy to all the brethren.
044	ACT	015	004	Then when they arrived at Jerusalem, they were cordially received by the church, and the apostles and presbyters, and they related how great things God had done by them.
044	ACT	015	005	But up rose some of the pharisaical sect, who professed the faith, insisting, That it was necessary to circumcise them, and to enjoin them to observe the law of Moses.
044	ACT	015	006	Then the apostles and presbyters were assembled to consider of this matter.
044	ACT	015	007	When after much dispute, Peter arose, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know that a considerable time ago God chose among us, by my mouth, that the Gentiles should hear the gospel-word, and believe.
044	ACT	015	008	And God, who is the discerner of the heart, bore them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as to us;
044	ACT	015	009	and made no difference betwixt either us or them, purifying their hearts by faith.
044	ACT	015	010	Why then now tempt ye God, by imposing a yoke on the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
044	ACT	015	011	But we believe that we shall be saved by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, in the same way as they.
044	ACT	015	012	Then the whole multitude kept silence, and listened to Barnabas and Paul, relating how great signs and miracles God had wrought among the Gentiles by them.
044	ACT	015	013	Now when they ceased speaking, James replied, saying, Men and brethren, hear me:
044	ACT	015	014	Simon hath fully related, how at first God graciously looked upon the Gentiles, to take from them a people for his name.
044	ACT	015	015	And in accord with this are the words of the prophets; as it is written,
044	ACT	015	016	“After this will I return, and build again the tabernacle of David, that is fallen; and re-edify what hath been dug up from the foundation, and will set it upright again:
044	ACT	015	017	that the residue of men may diligently seek the Lord, and all the Gentiles, among whom my name is invoked, even among them, saith the Lord, who doth all these things.”
044	ACT	015	018	Known unto God from the beginning are all his works.
044	ACT	015	019	Therefore I am decided, that we give no unnecessary disquietude to those who from the heathen have turned to God:
044	ACT	015	020	but that we write to them, that they abstain from pollutions of idol sacrifices, and from whoredom, and from what is strangled, and from blood.
044	ACT	015	021	For Moses for ages past in every city hath those who preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath-day.
044	ACT	015	022	Then it was determined by the apostles and presbyters with the whole church, to send select men from themselves unto Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren;
044	ACT	015	023	writing a letter by their hand, in these words: The apostles and presbyters and the brethren, to the brethren from among the Gentiles which are at Antioch, and in Syria, and Cilicia, greeting:
044	ACT	015	024	Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain persons who went out from us have disturbed you with discourses, unsettling your minds, insisting, that you should be circumcised, and observe the law: to whom we gave no such charge:
044	ACT	015	025	it hath seemed fit to us, assembled unanimously, to send unto you select men with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
044	ACT	015	026	men who have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
044	ACT	015	027	We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, and they by word of mouth will tell you the same things.
044	ACT	015	028	For it hath seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us, to lay upon you no other burden except these things which are of absolute necessity;
044	ACT	015	029	that ye abstain from eating whatever is sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from whoredom: from which things carefully preserving yourselves, ye shall do well. Farewell.
044	ACT	015	030	They then being thus dispatched, came to Antioch: and assembling the multitude, they delivered the letter:
044	ACT	015	031	and when they had read it, they rejoiced in the consolation of it.
044	ACT	015	032	Then Judas and Silas, being also themselves prophets, exhorted the brethren, in many a discourse, and established them.
044	ACT	015	033	And having stayed their time, they were dismissed in peace from the brethren to the apostles.
044	ACT	015	034	However Silas thought proper to abide there.
044	ACT	015	035	Paul also and Barnabas abode at Antioch, teaching and preaching, with many others also, the word of the Lord.
044	ACT	015	036	Then after certain days said Paul to Barnabas, Let us now return and visit our brethren in every city among whom we have preached the word of the Lord, that we may see how they hold on.
044	ACT	015	037	Now Barnabas had resolved to take with him John, whose surname is Mark.
044	ACT	015	038	But Paul did not think him a fit person to take with them, who had withdrawn from them from Pamphylia, and no longer went with them to the service.
044	ACT	015	039	So there grew up a sudden quarrel, insomuch that they separated from each other: and Barnabas, taking Mark with him, sailed away to Cyprus:
044	ACT	015	040	but Paul selecting Silas, departed, being commended by the brethren to the favour of God.
044	ACT	015	041	And he passed through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.
044	ACT	016	001	THEN he came to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold! a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a certain Jewish woman, who believed; but his father was a Greek:
044	ACT	016	002	who was highly spoken of by the brethren at Lystra and Iconium.
044	ACT	016	003	Him Paul resolved to take out with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places: for they all knew his father, that he was a Greek.
044	ACT	016	004	So as they passed through the cities, they delivered to them for their observance the ordinances decreed by the apostles and presbyters that were at Jerusalem.
044	ACT	016	005	Then were the churches established truly in the faith, and increased in number daily.
044	ACT	016	006	So passing through Phrygia and the region of Galatia, being forbidden by the Holy Ghost to speak the word in Asia,
044	ACT	016	007	coming as far as Mysia, they made an effort to go unto Bythinia: but the Spirit permitted them not.
044	ACT	016	008	Whereupon passing by Mysia they went down to Troas.
044	ACT	016	009	And a vision by night appeared to Paul; a certain man, a Macedonian, stood by him, entreating him, and saying, Pass over into Macedonia, and help us.
044	ACT	016	010	But when he saw the vision, immediately we sought to go forth into Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to preach the gospel to them.
044	ACT	016	011	Therefore sailing from Troas, we came in a direct course to Samothrace, and the next day to Neapolis;
044	ACT	016	012	and from thence to Philippi, which is the first city in that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we abode in that city some days.
044	ACT	016	013	And on the sabbath-day we went forth out of the city to the river side, where an oratory was by custom established; and sitting down, we spoke to the women who there assembled.
044	ACT	016	014	And a certain woman, Lydia by name, a seller of purple, from the city of Thyatira, a worshipper of God, hearkened: whose heart the Lord thoroughly opened, to attend to the words spoken by Paul.
044	ACT	016	015	So when she was baptised, and her house, she entreated, saying, Since ye have judged that I am faithful to the Lord, come and abide at my house. And she constrained us.
044	ACT	016	016	Now it happened as we were going to the oratory, a certain damsel having a pythonic spirit met us, who produced for her masters much gain as a fortuneteller:
044	ACT	016	017	she following Paul and us, cried out, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, who preach to you the way of salvation.
044	ACT	016	018	And this she did for several days. Then Paul was wearied out, and turning, said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out that very hour.
044	ACT	016	019	But when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they laid hold on Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the forum before the chief rulers,
044	ACT	016	020	and presenting them to the magistrates, they said, These are the men that exceedingly disturb the peace of our city, being Jews,
044	ACT	016	021	and enjoin customs which it is not lawful for us to receive, or to practise, being Romans.
044	ACT	016	022	And the populace stood up together against them: and the magistrates, after having had their garments torn from their backs, commanded them to be beaten with rods.
044	ACT	016	023	And laying on them many stripes, cast them into prison, commanding the jailor to keep them in safe custody:
044	ACT	016	024	who, receiving such an injunction, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.
044	ACT	016	025	But about midnight Paul and Silas, after joining in prayer, sang hymns to God: and the prisoners heard them.
044	ACT	016	026	And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the very foundations of the prison were shaken: and instantly all the doors flew open, and every man’s chains were loosed.
044	ACT	016	027	Then the jailor being roused from sleep, and seeing the doors of the prison open, drew his sword, going to destroy himself, supposing the prisoners had escaped.
044	ACT	016	028	But Paul called out with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no injury: for we are all here.
044	ACT	016	029	Thereupon calling for a light, he rushed in, and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas;
044	ACT	016	030	and having first brought them out, said, Sirs! what must I do to be saved?
044	ACT	016	031	And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, thou, and thy house.
044	ACT	016	032	And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all who were in his house.
044	ACT	016	033	And taking them that same hour of the night, he washed their stripes; and was baptised, himself and all who belonged to him immediately.
044	ACT	016	034	And when he had brought them into his house, he spread the table, and greatly rejoiced with all his household, believing in God.
044	ACT	016	035	But when it was day, the magistrates sent the lictors, saying, Set those men at large.
044	ACT	016	036	Then the jailor told these words to Paul, That the magistrates had sent to set them at liberty: now therefore, said he, get ye out, and pursue your journey in peace.
044	ACT	016	037	But Paul said to them, They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men that are Roman citizens, and have cast us into prison; and would they now clandestinely send us away? no, verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.
044	ACT	016	038	Then the lictors reported all these words to the magistrates: and they were terrified, when they heard they were Roman citizens.
044	ACT	016	039	So they came and spoke kindly to them, and fetching them out, besought them to depart from the city.
044	ACT	016	040	Then leaving the prison, they went unto Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and went their way.
044	ACT	017	001	SO journeying through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of Jews:
044	ACT	017	002	And Paul, according to his usual custom, went in to them, and for three sabbaths he reasoned with them from the scriptures,
044	ACT	017	003	opening them clearly, and laying it evidently down that the Messiah must suffer, and rise again from the dead; and that this man is the Messiah, even Jesus, whom I preach unto you.
044	ACT	017	004	And some of them believed, and associated themselves with Paul and Silas; and of the religious Greeks a vast multitude, and of the wives of the first people not a few.
044	ACT	017	005	But the unbelieving Jews, roused to a fit of zeal, and taking some of the lowest vulgar men of vile characters, and raising a mob, set the city in an uproar, and besetting the house of Jason, sought them to bring them unto the people.
044	ACT	017	006	But not finding them there, they dragged Jason and certain brethren to the city magistrates, roaring out, These are the men who are movers of sedition through the world, and are come in hither;
044	ACT	017	007	whom Jason has entertained in his house: and the practice of all these fellows is in direct opposition to all Caesar’s ordinances, for they affirm that another is king, one Jesus.
044	ACT	017	008	And they greatly agitated the people and the city magistrates when they heard these things.
044	ACT	017	009	So after taking sufficient security from Jason and the rest, they dismissed them.
044	ACT	017	010	Then the disciples immediately by night sent off both Paul and Silas to Berea; who were no sooner arrived, than they went into the synagogue of the Jews.
044	ACT	017	011	Now these were more liberally minded men than those of Thessalonica, for they received the word with all readiness of mind, daily, examining the Scriptures if these things were really so.
044	ACT	017	012	Then many of them truly believed: and of the Grecian proselyte women of respectability, and of the men not a few.
044	ACT	017	013	But when the Jews of Thessalonica knew that at Berea also the word of God was preached by Paul, they came thither, and stirred up the populace.
044	ACT	017	014	Then immediately on this the brethren sent off Paul, to go as if by sea: but Silas and Timothy abode there still.
044	ACT	017	015	And those who conduced Paul brought him as far as Athens, and receiving an injunction for Silas and Timothy that they should come to him as speedily as possible, they departed.
044	ACT	017	016	Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit within him was greatly grieved, beholding the city so devoted to idolatry.
044	ACT	017	017	Therefore he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews, and those who worshipped there, and in the forum every day with those he happened to meet.
044	ACT	017	018	Then certain of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers attacked him: and some said, What will this chattering fellow say? but others, He seemeth to be a preacher of foreign deities, because he preached to them Jesus and the resurrection.
044	ACT	017	019	So they took him and led him to the hill of Mars, saying, May we know what this novel doctrine taught by thee is?
044	ACT	017	020	For thou bringest some strange stories to our ears; we wish therefore to know what these things mean.
044	ACT	017	021	Now all the Athenians and the strangers who come to sojourn there, take pleasure in spending their time in nothing else but in talking, or hearing of some novelty.
044	ACT	017	022	Then Paul standing in the midst of the Areopagus said, Ye men of Athens, I observe that in all things ye are too much devoted to the worship of daemons.
044	ACT	017	023	For as I walked about, and attentively viewed the objects of your worship, I found even an altar on which was this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore you in ignorance adore, him I preach unto you.
044	ACT	017	024	The God who created the world, and all things in it, he that is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples of man’s construction;
044	ACT	017	025	nor is he served by human hands, as if he needed any creature, himself imparting to all beings life, and breath, and all things.
044	ACT	017	026	And hath made from one man’s blood all the nations of mankind, to dwell upon the whole face of the earth, fixing the predetermined periods of their existence, and the boundaries of their several abodes;
044	ACT	017	027	that they should seek the Lord, if indeed they might haply grope him out, and find him, though truly he is not far from any individual of us:
044	ACT	017	028	for from him we derive life, and power of motion, and existence; as also some of your own poets have said, “For we are even his offspring.”
044	ACT	017	029	Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to imagine that the Divinity is like to gold, or silver, or stone sculptured by human art or contrivance.
044	ACT	017	030	These times indeed of ignorance God then overlooked; but he now commands all men in every place to repent:
044	ACT	017	031	because he hath fixed the day in which he will judge the whole world in righteousness by the man whom he hath appointed; affording evidence of this to all, by raising him from the dead.
044	ACT	017	032	But when they heard of the resurrection from the dead, Some scoffed: and others said, We will hear thee again on this subject.
044	ACT	017	033	And so Paul departed from the midst of them.
044	ACT	017	034	But certain persons cleaving to him, believed: among whom was even Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
044	ACT	018	001	AND after these transactions, Paul departing from Athens, came to Corinth;
044	ACT	018	002	and finding a certain Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, lately arrived from Italy, with Priscilla his wife, (because Claudius had issued an order that all Jews should depart from Rome, ) he turned in to them.
044	ACT	018	003	And as he was of the same occupation, he abode with them, and worked, (for by trade they were tent-makers: )
044	ACT	018	004	and he discoursed in the synagogue every sabbath-day, and persuaded both the Jews and the Greek proselytes.
044	ACT	018	005	And when Silas and Timothy were come from Macedonia, Paul felt a strong impulse on his spirit, and forcibly testified to the Jews, that Jesus was the Messiah.
044	ACT	018	006	But as they continued opposing and blaspheming, he shook his garments, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am pure from it: from this moment will I go to the Gentiles.
044	ACT	018	007	And departing thence, he came to the house of a person, called Justus, one who worshipped God, whose house was contiguous to the synagogue.
044	ACT	018	008	But Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his house: and many of the Corinthians hearing, believed, and were baptised.
044	ACT	018	009	Then spake the Lord in a vision by night to Paul, Fear not, but speak; and hold not thy peace:
044	ACT	018	010	for I am with thee, and no man shall set himself against thee to do thee harm; because I have much people in this city.
044	ACT	018	011	And he sat down there a year and six months, teaching among them the word of God.
044	ACT	018	012	But when Gallio was the proconsul of Achaia, the Jews, with one accord, rose up against Paul, and brought him to the judgment-seat,
044	ACT	018	013	saying, This is the fellow that earnestly persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.
044	ACT	018	014	Then Paul being about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews,
044	ACT	018	015	If indeed this was now a matter of injustice, or wicked knavery, with reason I should hear you patiently; but if it be merely a controversy about the word, and names, and a law peculiar to yourselves, settle it yourselves: for I will be no judge of these matters.
044	ACT	018	016	And he drove them from the judgment-seat.
044	ACT	018	017	Then all the Greeks laid hold on Sosthenes the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the tribunal. And Gallio paid no regard to any of these things.
044	ACT	018	018	Then Paul abode there yet many days, and taking leave of the disciples, he set sail for Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having cut off his hair at Cenchrea: for he had a vow.
044	ACT	018	019	And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself went into the synagogue, and discoursed with the Jews.
044	ACT	018	020	But when they were importunate with him to prolong his stay among them, he consented not;
044	ACT	018	021	but took his leave of them, saying, I must by any means keep the approaching feast at Jerusalem: but I mean to return to you again, if God so please. So he sailed from Ephesus.
044	ACT	018	022	And landing at Cesarea, he went up, and having saluted the church at Jerusalem, he went down to Antioch.
044	ACT	018	023	And after making some stay, he departed, passing in regular order through the Galatian district, and Phrygia, confirming all the disciples.
044	ACT	018	024	Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, a man of eloquence, who was powerful in the Scriptures, had come to Ephesus.
044	ACT	018	025	He was instructed in the way of the Lord: and being fervent in spirit, he spake and taught very diligently the things concerning the Lord, though knowing only the baptism of John.
044	ACT	018	026	So this man began to speak with great boldness in the synagogue: but when Aquila and Priscilla heard him, they took him home with them, and more accurately expounded to him the way of the Lord.
044	ACT	018	027	And when he wished to pass over to Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him; who arriving, contributed much to confirm those who believed through grace.
044	ACT	018	028	For he strenuously argued with the Jews in public, demonstrating by the Scriptures that Jesus is the Messiah.
044	ACT	019	001	NOW it came to pass that during the time Apollos was at Corinth, Paul, after passing through the upper provinces, came to Ephesus; and finding certain disciples,
044	ACT	019	002	said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not even heard if the Holy Ghost is given.
044	ACT	019	003	And he asked them, Into what then were ye baptised? And they replied, Into John’s baptism.
044	ACT	019	004	Then said Paul, John indeed baptised with the baptism of repentance, saying to the people, That they should believe on him who was coming after him, that is, in Christ Jesus.
044	ACT	019	005	Now when they heard it, they were baptised into the name of the Lord Jesus.
044	ACT	019	006	And Paul laying on them his hands, the Holy Ghost came upon them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.
044	ACT	019	007	And the men were in all about twelve.
044	ACT	019	008	And entering into the synagogue, he spake boldly during three months, reasoning and persuading the things that concern the kingdom of God.
044	ACT	019	009	And when some were hardened, and infidel, speaking evil of the way before the people, he withdrew from them, and separated the disciples, discoursing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.
044	ACT	019	010	And this he did for two years; so that all who dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.
044	ACT	019	011	And God wrought by the hands of Paul extraordinary miracles;
044	ACT	019	012	so that even from his skin there were brought handkerchiefs and aprons unto the diseased, and their disorders were chased from them, and the evil spirits came out of them.
044	ACT	019	013	Then certain of the Jews, who went about as exorcists, attempted to make mention of the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.
044	ACT	019	014	And they were seven sons of Sceva a Jew, a chief priest, who did this.
044	ACT	019	015	Then the evil spirit replied, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?
044	ACT	019	016	And the man sprang upon them, in whom was the evil spirit, and getting the mastery over them, prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.
044	ACT	019	017	And this was known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who dwelt at Ephesus: and fear fell on them all, and they magnified the name of the Lord.
044	ACT	019	018	And many of those who believed came, confessing and declaring their practices.
044	ACT	019	019	And many of those who practised magical arts brought the books, and burned them before all men; and they calculated the prices of them, and found them worth fifty thousand pieces of silver.
044	ACT	019	020	So mightily did the word of God increase and prevail.
044	ACT	019	021	Now when these things were accomplished, Paul purposed by the Spirit, passing through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, That after I have been there, I must see Rome also.
044	ACT	019	022	Then he dispatched into Macedonia two of those who attended upon him, Timothy and Erastus; while he himself continued a while longer in Asia.
044	ACT	019	023	And there happened at that time no small disturbance about this way.
044	ACT	019	024	For a person named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made little temples in silver to represent that of Diana, brought to the artificers no small gain;
044	ACT	019	025	whom collecting together, with the workmen also of such trinkets, he said, Sirs, ye know that by this employment we make our advantageous livelihood:
044	ACT	019	026	and ye see and hear how not only at Ephesus, but almost through all Asia, this fellow Paul, by his persuasions, hath perverted a vast multitude, affirming that they are not gods which are made with hands:
044	ACT	019	027	so that not only is this our trade in danger of falling into contempt, but also that this temple of the great goddess Diana should be counted as nothing, and that henceforth also her magnificence should be utterly destroyed, whom all Asia and the whole world worshippeth.
044	ACT	019	028	On hearing this then, and being filled with rage, they cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.
044	ACT	019	029	And the whole city was filled with confusion; and they rushed unanimously into the theatre, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, Paul’s travelling companions.
044	ACT	019	030	But though Paul wished to go in to the people, the disciples would not permit him.
044	ACT	019	031	And some of the Asiarchs also, who were his friends, sent unto him, admonishing him not to venture himself into the theatre.
044	ACT	019	032	So they were crying out some one thing and some another: for the assembly was a scene of confusion, and the greater part knew not on what account they were collected together.
044	ACT	019	033	Then out of the crowd they brought forward Alexander, the Jews pushing him on: and Alexander, waving his hand, would fain have addressed his apology to the people.
044	ACT	019	034	But when they knew he was a Jew, one shout burst from all, crying for about the space of two hours, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.
044	ACT	019	035	Then the recorder having quieted the multitude, said, Men of Ephesus, who indeed is the man that doth not know that the city of the Ephesians is wholly devoted to the great goddess Diana, and to the image which fell down from Jupiter?
044	ACT	019	036	These things being then incontrovertible, it becomes you to be quiet, and to do nothing with precipitation.
044	ACT	019	037	For ye have brought hither these men, neither robbers of the temple, nor blasphemers of your goddess.
044	ACT	019	038	If then indeed Demetrius and the artificers that are with him have a charge against any man, the courts are held, and there are proconsuls: let them implead one another.
044	ACT	019	039	And if ye have any dispute about other matters, it shall be terminated in a lawful assembly,
044	ACT	019	040	For we are even in danger of being called to account for this day’s insurrection, there being no cause on account of which we can justify this tumultuary concourse:
044	ACT	019	041	and so saying, he dissolved the assembly.
044	ACT	020	001	THEN after the tumult was quieted, Paul called to him the disciples, and taking his leave, departed to go into Macedonia.
044	ACT	020	002	And passing through those parts, and having exhorted them with much discourse, he went into Greece.
044	ACT	020	003	And after three months stay, as the Jews were lying in wait for him, when he was just embarking for Syria, he determined to return through Macedonia.
044	ACT	020	004	And there accompanied him as far as Asia, Sopater a Berean; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and Tychicus and Trophimus, Asiatics.
044	ACT	020	005	These going before tarried for us at Troas.
044	ACT	020	006	And we sailed from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them to Troas after five days; where we stayed seven days.
044	ACT	020	007	And on the first day of the week, when the disciples were assembled to break bread, Paul preached unto them (ready to depart on the morrow), and extended his discourse until midnight.
044	ACT	020	008	Now there were many lamps in the upper room, where they were assembled.
044	ACT	020	009	And a certain youth named Eutytchus, who sat in the window, fell into a profound sleep: as Paul discoursed much longer than usual, quite overpowered with sleep, he fell down from a third story, and was taken up dead.
044	ACT	020	010	But Paul came down, and fell upon him, and taking him in his arms, said, Trouble not yourselves, for his life is yet in him.
044	ACT	020	011	And when he had gone up, and broken bread, and eaten, and conversed a long time, even to the break of day, he then departed.
044	ACT	020	012	And they brought the lad alive, and were comforted exceedingly.
044	ACT	020	013	Then we going before to the ship, sailed for Assos, intending there to take in Paul: for so he had ordered, meaning himself to walk thither.
044	ACT	020	014	And when he met us at Assos, we took him up, and came to Mytelene.
044	ACT	020	015	And sailing from thence, on the following day we advanced over against Chios; and the next day we touched at Samos, and staying at Trogyllium, the day following we came to Miletus.
044	ACT	020	016	For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, that he might not spend the time in Asia: for he hastened on, if it was possible for him, to be at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.
044	ACT	020	017	So he sent to Ephesus from Miletus, and called the presbyters of the church to attend him.
044	ACT	020	018	And when they were come unto him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the very first day in which I entered into Asia, how I have been among you at every season,
044	ACT	020	019	serving the Lord with all humility, and with many tears and trials, which have befallen me through the lying in wait of the Jews:
044	ACT	020	020	and that I have suppressed nothing which could conduce to your profiting; not desisting from preaching to you, and teaching you in public, and from house to house,
044	ACT	020	021	repeatedly urging both on Jews and Greeks repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ.
044	ACT	020	022	And now behold I am going, bound by the Spirit, unto Jerusalem, not knowing what things shall there befal me:
044	ACT	020	023	only this, that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying, that bonds and tribulation await thee.
044	ACT	020	024	Yet I make no account of any suffering, nor regard my life as of any value to myself, farther than as I may finish my course with joy, and the ministry which I have received of the Lord, to testify fully the Gospel of the grace of God.
044	ACT	020	025	And now behold, I know that ye shall see my face no more, even ye all, among whom I have gone in and out preaching the kingdom of God.
044	ACT	020	026	Wherefore I appeal to you this day as witnesses that I am pure from the blood of all men.
044	ACT	020	027	For I have concealed nothing, so as not repeatedly to declare to you the whole counsel of God.
044	ACT	020	028	Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over which the Holy Ghost hath made you bishops, to feed as shepherds the church of God, which he purchased with his own blood.
044	ACT	020	029	For this I know, that after my departure there will come among you grievous wolves, not sparing the flock:
044	ACT	020	030	Yea, from among yourselves shall men arise, speaking perverting doctrines, to draw away disciples after them.
044	ACT	020	031	Therefore watch, remembering that for three years, by night and by day, I have never ceased with tears to admonish every individual.
044	ACT	020	032	And now, brethren, I commit you to God and to the word of his grace, which is able to finish the superstructure, and to give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified.
044	ACT	020	033	The silver, or gold, or apparel of no man have I coveted:
044	ACT	020	034	but ye yourselves know that these hands have by labour furnished necessaries for my own wants, and for those who were with me.
044	ACT	020	035	In all things I have set you the example, that so labouring hard ye ought to help the infirm, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, because he himself said, “It is more blessed to give than to receive.”
044	ACT	020	036	And when he had spoken these things, he fell on his knees, and prayed with them all.
044	ACT	020	037	And all of them shed floods of tears, and fell upon Paul’s neck, and kissed him again and again,
044	ACT	020	038	most peculiarly afflicted at that word which he had spoken, that they should see his face no more: and they accompanied him unto the ship.
044	ACT	021	001	AND tearing ourselves away from them, when we had set sail, we came in a direct course to Coos, and the day after to Rhodes, and from thence to Patara.
044	ACT	021	002	And finding a ship passing over to Phenice, we went on board and set sail:
044	ACT	021	003	and coming in sight of Cyprus, and leaving it on the left, we sailed unto Syria, and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to discharge her cargo.
044	ACT	021	004	And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: and they said to Paul, by the Spirit, that he should not go up unto Jerusalem.
044	ACT	021	005	But when we had stayed out those days, we departed, and went on our journey, all of them attending us on our way, with wives and children, till we were out of the city: and kneeling down on the sea shore, we joined in prayer;
044	ACT	021	006	and embracing one another, we went on ship-board, and they returned to their own homes,
044	ACT	021	007	So completing our voyage, we arrived from Tyre at Ptolemais, and saluting the brethren, tarried with them one day.
044	ACT	021	008	And on the morrow we who were Paul’s companions departed with him, and went to Caesarea; and entering into the house of Philip the evangelist (who was one of the seven deacons), we abode with him.
044	ACT	021	009	Now this man had four maiden daughters endued with the gift of prophecy.
044	ACT	021	010	And as we tarried there several days, there came down a certain prophet from Judea named Agabus.
044	ACT	021	011	And coming to us, he took Paul’s girdle, and binding both his own hands and feet together, said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, The man, whose girdle this is, shall the Jews bind in like manner at Jerusalem, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.
044	ACT	021	012	Then when we heard these things, both we and all who were in the place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.
044	ACT	021	013	But Paul replied, Why do ye thus―weeping and breaking my heart? for I am ready not only to be bound, but to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.
044	ACT	021	014	And when he could not be persuaded, we desisted, saying, The will of the Lord be done.
044	ACT	021	015	Then after those days, packing up our baggage, we went up to Jerusalem:
044	ACT	021	016	and there went also with us some disciples from Caesarea, bringing one Mnason a Cyprian, an ancient disciple, at whose house we were to lodge.
044	ACT	021	017	And when we arrived at Jerusalem, the brethren received us with delight.
044	ACT	021	018	And on the morrow Paul went in with us unto James: and all the presbyters were present.
044	ACT	021	019	And after embracing them, he related every particular of the things which God had done among the Gentiles by his ministry.
044	ACT	021	020	And they, when they heard it, glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many myriads there are of Jews who have believed; and they are all zealots for the law:
044	ACT	021	021	And they have been informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews, who are among the Gentiles, apostacy from Moses, saying, That they should not circumcise the children, nor walk after the usual practices.
044	ACT	021	022	What then is to be done? The multitude must certainly be assembled; for they will hear that thou art come.
044	ACT	021	023	Do this therefore which we say to thee: we have four men, who have a vow upon themselves;
044	ACT	021	024	them take with thee, be purified with them, and be at the same expence as they, that they may shave their heads: and all men will know that there is no truth in the things reported of thee, but that thou thyself walkest orderly and observest the law.
044	ACT	021	025	Concerning the Gentiles who have believed, we have already written, deciding that they should observe no such thing, except that they should guard themselves from idol sacrifices, and blood, and what is strangled, and from whoredom.
044	ACT	021	026	Then Paul took the men, and the following day being purified with them, he entered into the temple, declaring when the days of their purification would be completed, in order whereunto an oblation was to be offered for every one of them.
044	ACT	021	027	But as the seven days were now drawing to their period, some Jews from Asia seeing him in the temple, excited all the populace to tumult, and laid hands upon him,
044	ACT	021	028	crying out, Men of Israel, help! This is the man, who, by his preaching, sets all men everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place: yea and more still, hath brought Greeks into the temple, and defiled this holy place:
044	ACT	021	029	(for they had before seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, whom they imagined that Paul had introduced into the temple.)
044	ACT	021	030	And the whole city was in motion, and there was a concourse of people assembled: and laying hands on Paul, they dragged him out of the temple; and immediately the doors were shut.
044	ACT	021	031	And as they were attempting to murder him, the report reached the military tribune of the band, that all Jerusalem was in confusion.
044	ACT	021	032	Who instantly taking soldiers and centurions ran down unto them: and when they saw the tribune and the soldiers, they left off beating Paul.
044	ACT	021	033	Then the tribune approaching him, laid hold on him, and ordered him to be bound with two chains; and asked who he was, and what he had done.
044	ACT	021	034	Then some among the multitude bellowed out one thing, and some another: so unable to know the certainty of the case because of the tumult, he ordered him to be brought into the fortress.
044	ACT	021	035	But when he was on the stairs, it happened that he was borne up by the soldiers, because of the press of the crowd.
044	ACT	021	036	For a multitude of the people followed, crying, Away with him!
044	ACT	021	037	And when he was just ready to be carried into the fortress, Paul said to the military tribune, May I be permitted to speak a word to thee? And he said, Dost thou know Greek?
044	ACT	021	038	Art not thou certainly that Egyptian who some time since raised a sedition, and led out into the desert four thousand cutthroats?
044	ACT	021	039	But Paul replied, I am indeed a Jew, a man of Tarsus, of Cilicia, a citizen of no contemptible city: and, I entreat thee, permit me to speak to the people.
044	ACT	021	040	So having his permission, Paul standing on the stairs, waved his hand to the people. And profound silence being obtained, he spake to them in the Hebrew tongue, saying,
044	ACT	022	001	MEN, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my apology which I now offer unto you.
044	ACT	022	002	Then when they heard that he spoke unto them in the Hebrew tongue, they kept the more silence: and he said,
044	ACT	022	003	I am indeed a Jewish man, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but educated in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, instructed accurately in the law of our fathers, being zealous for God, as ye all are this day:
044	ACT	022	004	so much so that I persecuted this way unto death, binding and delivering up to prisons both men and women.
044	ACT	022	005	As also the high-priest will bear me witness, and all the body of elders: from whom also having received letters unto the brethren, I went unto Damascus, to bring those who were there in chains unto Jerusalem, that they might be punished.
044	ACT	022	006	But as I went and drew nigh to Damascus, at noon-day, suddenly there shone a great light from heaven around me.
044	ACT	022	007	And I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
044	ACT	022	008	And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus the Nazarean, whom thou persecutest.
044	ACT	022	009	Now they who were with me saw the light indeed, and were terrified; but the voice of him that spake to me heard they not.
044	ACT	022	010	Then I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Arise, go into Damascus; and there information shall be given thee of all things which are ordained for thee to do.
044	ACT	022	011	Then as I could no longer see through the dazzling brightness of that light, led by the hand of those who were with me, I came to Damascus.
044	ACT	022	012	And one Ananias, a religious man according to the law, and in high repute with all the Jews dwelling there,
044	ACT	022	013	came to me, and standing by me, said, Brother Saul, recover sight. And the same hour I looked up at him.
044	ACT	022	014	And he said, The God of our fathers hath predestinated thee to know his will, and to see the Just One, and to hear a voice from his mouth.
044	ACT	022	015	For thou shalt be a witness for him to all men, of the things which thou hast seen and heard.
044	ACT	022	016	And now why delay? arise, to be baptised, and wash away thy sins, calling upon the name of the Lord.
044	ACT	022	017	Now it came to pass, that, when I had returned to Jerusalem, and was praying in the temple, that I was in a trance;
044	ACT	022	018	and beheld him saying to me, Make haste, and depart quickly from Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony of me.
044	ACT	022	019	And I said, Lord, they know that I was imprisoning and scourging from synagogue to synagogue those who believe on thee:
044	ACT	022	020	and when the blood of Stephen thy martyr was shed, I myself even stood by, and took delight in his execution, and guarded the garments of those who slew him.
044	ACT	022	021	And he said to me, Go: for I will send thee forth to the Gentiles afar off.
044	ACT	022	022	And they gave him audience to this sentence, and lifted up their voice, saying, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.
044	ACT	022	023	So when they began raising a vast clamour, and stripping off their garments, and casting dust into the air,
044	ACT	022	024	the military tribune commanded him to be brought into the fortress, ordering that he should be put to the question by scourging; that he might know for what cause they clamoured so loudly against him.
044	ACT	022	025	So as they were tying him up for the thongs, Paul said to the centurion standing by him, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman citizen, and uncondemned?
044	ACT	022	026	And when the centurion heard this, he came and told the military tribune, saying, Consider what you are going to do: for this man is a Roman citizen.
044	ACT	022	027	Then the tribune came, and said to him, Tell me, art thou a Roman citizen? And he said, Yes.
044	ACT	022	028	And the tribune replied, With a large sum of money I purchased this citizenship. And Paul said, But I enjoy it as my birthright.
044	ACT	022	029	Immediately then they who were about to put him to the question, withdrew from him: and indeed the tribune dreaded the consequences, when he knew that he was a Roman citizen, that he had even gone so far as to bind him.
044	ACT	022	030	So on the morrow, desirous to know of a certainty what it was of which he was accused by the Jews, he loosed him from the bonds, and commanded the high-priest and all the sanhedrim to appear, and bringing Paul down, set him before them.
044	ACT	023	001	THEN Paul, looking earnestly at the sanhedrim, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience unto God even to this day.
044	ACT	023	002	Then the high-priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to smite him on the mouth.
044	ACT	023	003	Then said Paul unto him, God is ready to smite thee, thou whited wall: for art thou sitting to judge me according to the law, and violating that law, commandest me to be smitten?
044	ACT	023	004	Then they who stood by, said, Revilest thou God’s high-priest?
044	ACT	023	005	And Paul said, I had not observed, brethren, that he was high-priest: for it is written, “Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.”
044	ACT	023	006	Now when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried in the sanhedrim, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: for the hope and resurrection of the dead am I brought to this bar.
044	ACT	023	007	So when he had said this, a great dissension arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.
044	ACT	023	008	For the Sadducees say indeed, that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.
044	ACT	023	009	And a great clamour arose: and the scribes rising up who were of the party of the Pharisees, contended stoutly, saying, We find no fault in this man: but if a spirit have spoken to him, or an angel, let us not fight against God.
044	ACT	023	010	Then a great tumult arising, the tribune, apprehensive that Paul might be pulled in pieces by them, commanded the guard to go down, and take him by force from the midst of them, and bring him into the fortress.
044	ACT	023	011	And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good courage, Paul: for as thou hast borne testimony of the things concerning me at Jerusalem, so must thou bear a testimony at Rome also.
044	ACT	023	012	Then as soon as it was day, some of the Jews forming a conspiracy, bound themselves under the direst imprecation, declaring that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.
044	ACT	023	013	Now there were more than forty who had on oath formed this conspiracy.
044	ACT	023	014	So they came to the high-priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves by the direst imprecation, to taste nothing till we have killed Paul.
044	ACT	023	015	Now therefore do ye with the sanhedrim give notice to the military tribune, that to-morrow he bring him down to you, as if intending to make more accurate inquiries into the things concerning him: but we, ere he come nigh, are ready to kill him.
044	ACT	023	016	Now Paul’s sister’s son having heard of their lying in wait, came, and entering into the fortress told Paul.
044	ACT	023	017	Then Paul calling to him one of the centurions, said, Carry this young man to the tribune: for he hath something to communicate to him.
044	ACT	023	018	Then he took him, and brought him to the tribune, and said, The prisoner Paul calling me to him, entreated me to bring this young man to thee, having something to say to thee.
044	ACT	023	019	Hereupon the tribune taking him by the hand, and leading him aside, inquired, What is it that thou hast to communicate to me?
044	ACT	023	020	And he said, The Jews have agreed together to entreat thee that to-morrow thou wouldest bring down Paul into the sanhedrim, as about to make some more accurate inquiry concerning him.
044	ACT	023	021	But do not thou consent to them: for more than forty men of them are lying in wait for him, who have bound themselves under an anathema, neither to eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now they are in readiness, waiting only to procure the promise from thee.
044	ACT	023	022	Hereupon the tribune dismissed the youth, with an injunction, not to mention it to any body that thou hast discovered these things to me.
044	ACT	023	023	And calling to him two certain persons of the centurions, he said, Get ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen, at the third hour of the night;
044	ACT	023	024	and provide beasts, that setting Paul thereon, you may convey him safely to Felix the governor.
044	ACT	023	025	And he wrote a letter containing this form of words:
044	ACT	023	026	Claudius Lysias to his excellence the governor Felix, greeting.
044	ACT	023	027	This person had been seized by the Jews, and was ready to be slain by them: but coming on them with the guard, I rescued him out of their hands, having understood that he was a Roman citizen.
044	ACT	023	028	And desirous of knowing the crime of which they accused him, I brought him down into their sanhedrim
044	ACT	023	029	and found him accused of some disputed points of their law; but to have no charge laid against him worthy of death or of bonds.
044	ACT	023	030	But it being discovered to me that a design was forming against the man’s life by the Jews, immediately I sent him to thee, commanding his accusers also to produce what they have against him before thee. Farewel.
044	ACT	023	031	Hereupon then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night unto Antipatris.
044	ACT	023	032	And on the morrow, leaving the horsemen to go on with him, they returned to the fortress.
044	ACT	023	033	So when they came to Caesarea, and had delivered the letter to the governor, they presented Paul also to him.
044	ACT	023	034	Then when the governor had read it, and asked of what province he was, and understood he was of Cilicia;
044	ACT	023	035	I will give thee a thorough hearing, said he, when thy accusers are also come hither. And he commanded them to be kept under guard in Herod’s praetorium.
044	ACT	024	001	SO after five days Ananias the high-priest went down with the elders, and a certain rhetorician, Tertullus, who made their appearance before the governor against Paul.
044	ACT	024	002	And he being summoned, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Since by thee we enjoy so much peace, and such noble acts are happily performed for this nation by thy provident administration,
044	ACT	024	003	always and in all places we acknowledge it, most excellent Felix, with all gratitude.
044	ACT	024	004	Now that I may not be unnecessarily tedious to thee, I entreat thee to hear us briefly with thy wonted candour.
044	ACT	024	005	For we found this fellow a pest to society, and exciting sedition among all the Jews throughout the whole world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazareans:
044	ACT	024	006	who even attempted to profane the temple: we seized him therefore, and intended to judge him according to our own law.
044	ACT	024	007	But Lysias the tribune came, and with great violence took him out of our hands,
044	ACT	024	008	commanding his accusers to appear before thee: whereby thou mayest thyself be able after examination to know the certainty of those things whereof we accuse him.
044	ACT	024	009	Then the Jews also joined in affirming, that these things were so.
044	ACT	024	010	But Paul (the governor having made him a sign to speak) replied, Knowing that for so many years thou hast been the judge of this nation, I with the more confidence offer my defence respecting the matters which concern me:
044	ACT	024	011	as thou mayest be ascertained, that it is not more than twelve days ago since I went up to worship in Jerusalem.
044	ACT	024	012	And neither in the temple found they me disputing with any man, nor raising any sedition among the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:
044	ACT	024	013	neither can they produce any proof of the facts of which they accuse me.
044	ACT	024	014	But this I confess to thee, that after the way which they call a sect, so worship I the God of our ancestors, believing all things that are written in the law, and in the prophets:
044	ACT	024	015	and having hope in God, the same which they also profess to look for, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and of the unjust.
044	ACT	024	016	For this cause indeed I exert my utmost care to keep my conscience ever unoffending towards God and towards man.
044	ACT	024	017	Now after many years absence I was returned bringing alms to my countrymen, and oblations to the temple.
044	ACT	024	018	In the discharge of which offices certain Jews of Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with a multitude, nor with any tumult.
044	ACT	024	019	Who ought to have appeared before thee, and prefer their accusation, if they had any thing against me.
044	ACT	024	020	Or let the persons themselves here present say, if they found any thing criminal in me, when I stood before the sanhedrim,
044	ACT	024	021	except for this one sentence, which I uttered aloud when I was standing among them, For the resurrection of the dead am I this day judged by you.
044	ACT	024	022	When Felix then heard these things he put them off, (for he knew very exactly all that related to that way, ) saying, When Lysias the tribune is come down, I will inquire thoroughly into the matters between you.
044	ACT	024	023	And he commanded the centurion that Paul should be safe kept, yet have no close confinement, and not to hinder any of his friends from supplying his wants, or visiting him.
044	ACT	024	024	Now after some days, Felix returning with Drusilla his wife, who was a Jewess, sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.
044	ACT	024	025	And as he discoursed of righteousness, and temperance, and the judgment which is ready to be revealed, Felix being greatly terrified, replied, Go, for the present, I will some time hence take another opportunity of calling for thee.
044	ACT	024	026	Indeed he had also entertained hope that money would be given him by Paul, in order to release him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and conversed with him.
044	ACT	024	027	But when two years were ended, Felix had Portius Festus appointed for his successor: and willing to curry favour with the Jews, Felix left Paul in chains.
044	ACT	025	001	WHEN Festus then was come into the province, after three days he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.
044	ACT	025	002	And the high-priest and the principal persons among the Jews informed him against Paul, and entreated him,
044	ACT	025	003	begging it as a favour from him, that he would send him back to Jerusalem, lying in wait for him to kill him on the road.
044	ACT	025	004	Then Festus answered, that Paul should be kept in custody at Caesarea, and that he himself was going thither shortly.
044	ACT	025	005	Let therefore, said he, those among you who are able, go down with me, and accuse him, if there be anything criminal in this man.
044	ACT	025	006	And after staying with them more than ten days, he went down to Caesarea; and on the morrow seated on the bench, commanded Paul to be brought.
044	ACT	025	007	And on his appearing, the Jews who came down from Jerusalem surrounded him, and laid many and heavy accusations against Paul, which they were not able to prove.
044	ACT	025	008	But he pleaded in his defence, That neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar, have I committed the least offence.
044	ACT	025	009	Then Festus, desirous of ingratiating himself with the Jews, replying to Paul, said, Wilt thou go up unto Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?
044	ACT	025	010	Then said Paul, I am standing before the tribunal of Caesar, where I have a right to be judged: against the Jews I have committed no offence, as thou also clearly perceivest.
044	ACT	025	011	For indeed if I have committed any crime, or done aught worthy of death, I object not to be put to death: but if there is nothing in those things whereof they accuse me, no man dare gratify them by abandoning me to them.
044	ACT	025	012	I appeal unto Caesar. Then Festus, after conferring with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed to Caesar? to Caesar shalt thou go.
044	ACT	025	013	Now when some days were passed, Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to salute Festus.
044	ACT	025	014	And as their stay there was extended to a considerable time, Festus communicated to the king Paul’s affairs, saying, There is a certain man left by Felix, a prisoner:
044	ACT	025	015	against whom when I was at Jerusalem, the high-priest and the elders of the Jews appeared, desiring judgment against him.
044	ACT	025	016	To whom I replied, That it was not customary for Romans to give up any man gratuitously to destruction, before that the person accused should have his accusers produced face to face, and be allowed opportunity to defend himself against the charge.
044	ACT	025	017	When therefore they were come here together, making no demur, the very next day I sat on the tribunal, and commanded the man to be brought.
044	ACT	025	018	Against whom his accusers standing forth, brought no charge of such things as I expected:
044	ACT	025	019	but only pleaded against him certain disputes about their own mode of religious worship, and about one Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.
044	ACT	025	020	But being in doubt respecting a question of this sort, I demanded if he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things.
044	ACT	025	021	But Paul appealing that he should be reserved for the cognizance of Augustus, I ordered him to be kept in custody until I should send him to Caesar.
044	ACT	025	022	Then Agrippa said to Festus, I wish also myself to hear the man. He said, To-morrow thou shalt hear him.
044	ACT	025	023	On the morrow therefore, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with a very splendid retinue, and were entered into the place of audience, with the military tribunes, and the men of superior eminence in the city, then at the order of Festus Paul was produced.
044	ACT	025	024	And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all you, sirs, who are present with us, behold the man, concerning whom the whole multitude of the Jews have set upon me, both at Jerusalem and in this place, clamouring that he ought not to live a moment longer.
044	ACT	025	025	But finding on inquiry that he had done nothing worthy of death, and he himself indeed having appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.
044	ACT	025	026	Respecting whom I have nothing determinate to write to my sovereign. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and especially before thee, king Agrippa, that on a fresh examination taken, I might have something to write.
044	ACT	025	027	For it appears to me highly unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not also signify the charges against him.
044	ACT	026	001	THEN Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretching out his hand, began his defence:
044	ACT	026	002	I count myself happy, king Agrippa, that I am about to address my defence to thee this day concerning all the things of which I am accused by the Jews:
044	ACT	026	003	especially as thou art skilled both in all the customs, and questions which respect the Jews: wherefore I beg the favour of thee to hear me patiently.
044	ACT	026	004	The manner of my life even from my youth, which from its beginning was spent amidst my own nation at Jerusalem, know indeed all the Jews;
044	ACT	026	005	who previously knew me a long while ago, (if they chose to bear testimony, ) that according to the most precise sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.
044	ACT	026	006	And this moment for the hope of the promise made of God to our fathers am I standing here to be judged:
044	ACT	026	007	which promise our twelve tribes, with fervour night and day worshipping God, hope to attain. For which hope, king Agrippa, I am criminated by the Jews.
044	ACT	026	008	What! is it judged a thing incredible by you, that God should raise the dead?
044	ACT	026	009	I indeed then thought in myself, that I ought to do many things in opposition to the name of Jesus the Nazarean.
044	ACT	026	010	Which also I did at Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were killed, I gave my vote against them.
044	ACT	026	011	And in every synagogue oftentimes punishing them, I compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly maddened with rage against them, I persecuted them even to the cities that are without.
044	ACT	026	012	In which pursuits, even as I was going to Damascus with authority and a commission from the chief priests,
044	ACT	026	013	at midday, O king, I saw on the road a light from heaven, beyond the splendour of the sun, shining around myself and those who were travelling with me.
044	ACT	026	014	And as we were all fallen prostrate on the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saving in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is difficult for thee to kick against the goads.
044	ACT	026	015	Then I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he replied, I am Jesus whom thou art persecuting.
044	ACT	026	016	Notwithstanding, arise, and stand on thy feet: for to this end have I appeared to thee, to ordain thee both a minister and a witness of the things which thou hast seen, and of those which I will shew thee;
044	ACT	026	017	delivering thee both from the people, and from the Gentiles, to whom now I send thee,
044	ACT	026	018	to open their eyes, to convert them from darkness to light, and from the dominion of Satan unto God, that they may receive remission of sins, and an inheritance with those who are sanctified by faith which is in me.
044	ACT	026	019	Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision:
044	ACT	026	020	but preached first to those at Damascus, and Jerusalem, and to all the region of Judea, and to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, practicing works worthy of repentance.
044	ACT	026	021	Because of these things, the Jews seizing me in the temple, attempted to kill me on the spot.
044	ACT	026	022	Having however obtained help from God, unto this day, I stand witnessing both to small and great, saying nothing but what both the prophets and Moses said should come to pass:
044	ACT	026	023	that the Messiah should suffer, and that he being the first who should rise from the dead, should display light to the people, and to the Gentiles.
044	ACT	026	024	As thus he was proceeding in his defence, Festus with a loud voice said, Paul, thou art raving; much reading hath driven thee to madness.
044	ACT	026	025	But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but utter words of truth and sobriety.
044	ACT	026	026	For the king is well acquainted with these things, before whom also I speak with the greatest freedom. For I am persuaded that none of these events have escaped his notice; for this thing was not done in a corner.
044	ACT	026	027	King Agrippa! believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.
044	ACT	026	028	Then Agrippa said to Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.
044	ACT	026	029	And Paul replied, would to God, that not only thou, but also that all who are hearing me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these chains.
044	ACT	026	030	So when he had thus spoken, the king arose, and the governor, and Bernice, and they who sat with him,
044	ACT	026	031	and retiring, conversed together, saying, This man hath done nothing worthy of death, or of chains.
044	ACT	026	032	And Agrippa said to Festus, This man might have been discharged, if he had not appealed to Caesar.
044	ACT	027	001	NOW as it was determined that we should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of the Augustan cohort.
044	ACT	027	002	And embarking in a ship of Adrymittium, ready to sail for the coast of Asia, we proceeded on our voyage, Aristarchus a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.
044	ACT	027	003	And the next day we arrived at Sidon: and Julius treated Paul with the greatest humanity, and permitted him to go to his friends, to enjoy the benefit of their care.
044	ACT	027	004	And taking our departure from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.
044	ACT	027	005	And traversing the sea opposite to Cilicia and Pamphylia, we arrived at Myra, a city of Lycia.
044	ACT	027	006	And the centurion finding there a ship of Alexandria bound for Italy, he put us on board of it.
044	ACT	027	007	Then for many days making very slow way, and scarce reaching over against Knidos, the wind not favouring us, we coasted Crete, opposite Cape Salmone:
044	ACT	027	008	and weathering it with difficulty, we came to a certain place called, The fair havens; near to which is the city Lasea.
044	ACT	027	009	And much time being consumed, and sailing now becoming dangerous, because the fast was already past, Paul admonished them,
044	ACT	027	010	saying unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be attended with much damage and loss, not only of the cargo and of the ship, but danger of our lives also.
044	ACT	027	011	But the centurion paid more attention to the master and to the pilot than to the things which were spoken by Paul.
044	ACT	027	012	And the harbour not being well situated for a winter station, the greater part advised to sail from thence, if they possibly could reach as far as Phenice to pass the winter, a harbour open to the south-west and north-west.
044	ACT	027	013	So when the south wind blew softly, supposing they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor, and kept near the coast of Crete.
044	ACT	027	014	But not long after a hurricane wind, called Euroclydon, drove us towards the island,
044	ACT	027	015	and the ship becoming ungovernable, and unable to bear up in the eye of the wind, we gave up the attempt, and let her drive.
044	ACT	027	016	And running under a little island called Clauda, it was with difficulty we were able to come at the boat:
044	ACT	027	017	which when they had hoisted out, they used all helps, carrying ropes round the ship’s bottom; and fearing lest they should run on the quick-sands, they lowered the mast, and so were driven.
044	ACT	027	018	And being exceedingly tossed with the storm, we the next day threw out the cargo.
044	ACT	027	019	And the third day with our own hands we threw overboard the tackling of the vessel.
044	ACT	027	020	So when neither sun nor stars had appeared for many days, and no small tempest beating on us, all hope of our being preserved was entirely taken from us.
044	ACT	027	021	Now after being a long while without food, then stood up Paul in the midst of them, and said, Ye ought, my friends, to have been persuaded by me, and not have sailed from Crete, and got this loss and damage.
044	ACT	027	022	Yet even now I exhort you to be of good courage: for there shall be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.
044	ACT	027	023	For there stood by me this night an angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,
044	ACT	027	024	saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must stand before Caesar: and behold! God hath graciously given thee all who are sailing with thee.
044	ACT	027	025	Wherefore, sirs, cheer up: for I believe God that it will be so, exactly as he hath spoken to me.
044	ACT	027	026	But we must be cast on a certain island.
044	ACT	027	027	Now as the fourteenth night was passing, whilst we were driving about in the Adriatic sea, about midnight the sailors imagined that some land was near to them:
044	ACT	027	028	and sounding, had twenty fathoms; then passing on a little farther, and sounding again, they had fifteen fathoms.
044	ACT	027	029	And fearing lest they might run on some rocky coast, they cast out four anchors astern, and wished eagerly for the day to break.
044	ACT	027	030	Now as the sailors were seeking to escape out of the ship, and had hoisted out the boat into the sea, under pretence as if they were going to carry out anchors a-head,
044	ACT	027	031	Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these men abide in the ship, ye cannot be preserved.
044	ACT	027	032	Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.
044	ACT	027	033	And while they waited until the day should break, Paul exhorted them all to take some nourishment, saying, To day, expecting the fourteenth day, ye are continuing without food, taking nothing.
044	ACT	027	034	Wherefore I exhort you to take some food, for this is for your preservation: for a hair shall not fall from the head of any one of you.
044	ACT	027	035	And so saying, and taking a loaf, he gave thanks to God before them all, and breaking it, began to eat.
044	ACT	027	036	Then were they all cheered up, and they too took refreshment.
044	ACT	027	037	Now all the souls which were in the ship amounted to two hundred seventy-six:
044	ACT	027	038	and having made a hearty meal, they lightened the vessel, throwing the wheat into the sea.
044	ACT	027	039	And when the day broke, they knew not the land: but they observed a certain creek with a beach, into which they resolved, if they could, to run the vessel aground.
044	ACT	027	040	And weighing the anchors, they committed her to the sea, and loosing at the same time the chains of the rudders, and hoisting the foresail to the breeze, they made for the beach.
044	ACT	027	041	But falling on a shoal where two currents met, they ran the ship aground; and the forecastle stuck fast, and remained immoveable, but the stern was stove in by the violence of the waves.
044	ACT	027	042	Then the soldiers’ design was to have murdered the prisoners, lest any of them should swim ashore and escape.
044	ACT	027	043	But the centurion, desirous to preserve Paul, withheld them from their purpose, and commanded those who were able to swim to jump overboard first, and reach the land:
044	ACT	027	044	and that the rest should make the attempt, some on planks, and some on the floating materials of the ship: and in this manner so it was that they all safely reached the shore.
044	ACT	028	001	AND being safe landed, we then understood that the island was called Melita.
044	ACT	028	002	And the rude people treated us with singular humanity; for, lighting a fire, they received us all, because of the violent rain, and because of the cold.
044	ACT	028	003	But as Paul was gathering up a faggot of sticks, and laying them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.
044	ACT	028	004	Now when the rude people saw the venomous animal hanging from his hand, they said one to another, Surely this man is a murderer, whom though preserved from the sea, righteous vengeance suffereth not to live.
044	ACT	028	005	But he then shaking off the venomous animal into the fire, suffered no manner of inconvenience.
044	ACT	028	006	Now they expected that a violent inflammation would ensue, or that he would have fallen suddenly dead: but when, after waiting a considerable time, they saw no inconvenience arise to him, they changed their opinion, and said that he was a divinity.
044	ACT	028	007	Now in the vicinity of that place was the estate of the principal person on the island, named Publius, who received us into his house, and lodged us with great humanity three days.
044	ACT	028	008	And it so happened that the father of Publius was then confined to his bed with an attack of fever and dysentery: unto whom Paul went in, and after praying, laid his hands upon him, and healed him.
044	ACT	028	009	This then being the case, all the rest also who had diseases in the island came to him, and were healed.
044	ACT	028	010	Then they honoured us with many tokens of respect; and when we were about to sail, laid in for us every necessary store.
044	ACT	028	011	And after three months stay we sailed in a ship which had wintered in the island, from Alexandria, whose sign was Castor and Pollux:
044	ACT	028	012	and proceeding on our voyage to Syracuse, we tarried there three days:
044	ACT	028	013	from whence we came round, and arrived opposite to Rhegium; and after one day the south wind arising, we came in two more to Puteoli:
044	ACT	028	014	where finding brethren, we were solicited by them to tarry seven days; and so we went for Rome.
044	ACT	028	015	And the brethren from thence, when they heard of our motions, came out to meet us as far as Appii Forum and the Three Taverns: whom when Paul saw, he gave thanks to God, and felt fresh courage.
044	ACT	028	016	And when we were come to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard; but he permitted Paul to have an apartment by himself, with a soldier only who guarded him.
044	ACT	028	017	Now it came to pass that after three days Paul called together the principal persons of the Jews. And when they were assembled, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have done nothing contrary to the people and the customs of our ancestors, yet have I been delivered up a prisoner into the hands of the Romans.
044	ACT	028	018	Who, after a full examination, would have discharged me, because there was not the least cause found in me for death.
044	ACT	028	019	But when the Jews opposed it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I have any accusation to bring against my countrymen.
044	ACT	028	020	For this cause therefore have I invited you hither, to see and to converse with you; for on account of the hope of Israel am I bound with this chain.
044	ACT	028	021	Then they said to him, We have neither received letters concerning thee from Judea, nor hath any one of the brethren who is arrived reported or spoken any thing evil of thee.
044	ACT	028	022	But we think it highly proper to hear from thee what thy sentiments are; for indeed as to this sect, it is well known to us that everywhere it meets with opposition.
044	ACT	028	023	Then having fixed a day with him, still more of them came to him at his lodging, to whom bearing his testimony, he set forth the kingdom of God, and persuaded them of the things relating to Jesus, both out of the law of Moses and the prophets, from morning until evening:
044	ACT	028	024	and some were convinced by the things which were spoken, but others continued in their unbelief.
044	ACT	028	025	So being divided in sentiment among themselves, they broke up, Paul adding one word, That well had the Holy Ghost spoken by Isaiah the prophet unto our fathers,
044	ACT	028	026	saying, Go to this people, and say, “In hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, yet in nowise perceive.
044	ACT	028	027	For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and with their ears they are thick of hearing, and their eyes have they shut; lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and become converts, and I should heal them.”
044	ACT	028	028	Be it known therefore unto you, that to the Gentiles is the salvation of God sent, and they will hear.
044	ACT	028	029	And when he had thus spoken, the Jews went away, and had much disputing among themselves.
044	ACT	028	030	But Paul abode two whole years in his own hired apartment, and received all who came to him,
044	ACT	028	031	preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ with all freedom of discourse, and without the least interruption.

# BOOK	045	ROM	Romans	Romans
045	ROM	001	001	PAUL, a servant of Jesus Christ, a called apostle, set apart for the Gospel of God,
045	ROM	001	002	(which he had promised before by his prophets in the holy scriptures, )
045	ROM	001	003	concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord; made from the seed of David after the flesh,
045	ROM	001	004	definitively marked out as the Son of God by miracle, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection of the dead:
045	ROM	001	005	through whom we have received grace and apostolic mission among all nations for his name, to bring them to the obedience of faith:
045	ROM	001	006	among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ.
045	ROM	001	007	To all that are at Rome, beloved of God, called saints, grace unto you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
045	ROM	001	008	First then I give thanks to my God, through Jesus Christ, for you all, because your faith is proclaimed through the whole world.
045	ROM	001	009	For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the Gospel of his Son, how incessantly I make mention of you,
045	ROM	001	010	always in my prayers entreating that haply now at last I may have a prosperous journey by the will of God, to come to you.
045	ROM	001	011	For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, in order that you may be established;
045	ROM	001	012	and that so I may be comforted together with you, by the mutual faith both of you and of me.
045	ROM	001	013	But I would not that ye should be unacquainted, brethren, that oftentimes I have been purposing to come to you (and have been prevented until now), that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among the other Gentile nations.
045	ROM	001	014	Both to the Greeks and barbarians, both to the wise and the ignorant am I a debtor.
045	ROM	001	015	So, as far as is in my power, I am desirous to preach the Gospel to you that are at Rome also.
045	ROM	001	016	For I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God for salvation to every one who believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.
045	ROM	001	017	For the righteousness of God by faith is therein revealed for belief; as it is written, “Now the just by faith shall live.”
045	ROM	001	018	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all impiety and unrighteousness of men, holding back the truth in unrighteousness.
045	ROM	001	019	Because that which is capable of being known relative to God, is evident among them; for God hath manifested it to them.
045	ROM	001	020	For from the creation of the world his invisible perfections, discoverable in the works that are made, are clearly seen, even his eternal power and deity; so that they are inexcusable:
045	ROM	001	021	because though they knew there was a God, they glorified him not as God, nor gave him thanks, but became triflers in their disputations, and their stupid heart was darkened.
045	ROM	001	022	Affecting to be sophists, they turned idiots,
045	ROM	001	023	and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of an image of a corruptible man, and of birds, and of quadrupeds, and of reptiles.
045	ROM	001	024	Wherefore God abandoned them, through the lusts of their own hearts, unto impurity, to dishonour their own bodies by themselves:
045	ROM	001	025	who perverted the truth of God by falsehood, and worshipped and paid divine honours to the thing created instead of the Creator, who is blessed for evermore. Amen.
045	ROM	001	026	For this cause God gave them up to dishonourable passions. For even their women did change the natural use into that which was contrary to nature;
045	ROM	001	027	and likewise the men also, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lewdness one towards another; men with men committing indecency, and receiving in themselves the recompence of their delusion, which was meet.
045	ROM	001	028	And since they thought not fit to hold the Deity in acknowledgment, God abandoned them to a reprobate mind, to practise deeds unbecoming;
045	ROM	001	029	replete with all injustice, whoredom, wickedness, covetousness, villany; full of envy, murder, contention, deceit, evil habits; whisperers,
045	ROM	001	030	backbiters, God-haters, contumelious, insolent, boasters, inventors of wicked practices, disobedient to parents,
045	ROM	001	031	unintelligent, unfaithful to engagements, unnatural, implacable, unmerciful:
045	ROM	001	032	who, though they know the righteous judgment of God, that they who live in such practices are worthy of death, not only do the same, but also find pleasure in the company of those who live in these practices.
045	ROM	002	001	THEREFORE thou art inexcusable, O man, even every one that judgeth: for in the very thing wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest art living in the practices of the same things.
045	ROM	002	002	But we know that the judgment of God is according to truth, against those who practise such things.
045	ROM	002	003	For thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest those who do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?
045	ROM	002	004	Or despisest thou the riches of his kindness and patience and long-suffering, ignorant that this goodness of God is leading thee to repentance?
045	ROM	002	005	But after thy obdurate and impenitent heart treasurest up for thyself wrath at the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God,
045	ROM	002	006	who will recompense to every man according to his works;
045	ROM	002	007	to those who, in the patient practice of good works, seek glory and honour and immortality―eternal life.
045	ROM	002	008	But to those who are of a contentious spirit, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation, and wrath;
045	ROM	002	009	tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that doeth wickedness, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek.
045	ROM	002	010	But glory and honour and peace be to every man who doeth that which is good, to the Jew first and also to the Greek:
045	ROM	002	011	for there is no acceptance of persons with God.
045	ROM	002	012	For as many as have sinned without the law, shall perish also without the law: and as many as have sinned under the law shall be judged by the law;
045	ROM	002	013	for the hearers of the law are not righteous before God, but the doers of the law shall be counted righteous;
045	ROM	002	014	(for when the Gentiles, who have not the law naturally, do the things of the law, these, though not having the law, are a law unto themselves:
045	ROM	002	015	which exhibit the practice of the law written on their hearts, their conscience also bearing its testimony, and their mutual reasonings at intervals bringing accusations or forming excuses; )
045	ROM	002	016	in the day when God shall judge the hidden things of men, according to my gospel by Jesus Christ.
045	ROM	002	017	Lo! thou art named a Jew, and restest on the law, and boastest in God,
045	ROM	002	018	and knowest the will of God, and bringest to the test the things that are different, being instructed out of the law;
045	ROM	002	019	and hast confidence that thou thyself art a leader of the blind, a light of those who are in darkness,
045	ROM	002	020	an instructor of the uninformed, a teacher of babes, holding the form of knowledge and of truth in the law.
045	ROM	002	021	Thou therefore who teachest another, dost thou not teach thyself? thou that proclaimest aloud that a man should not steal, dost thou steal?
045	ROM	002	022	thou that sayest, Do not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that holdest idols in abomination, dost thou commit sacrilege?
045	ROM	002	023	thou who gloriest in the law, dishonourest thou God by the transgression of the law?
045	ROM	002	024	for the name of God is blasphemed through you among the heathen, as it is written.
045	ROM	002	025	For circumcision indeed is advantageous, if thou practise the law: but if thou art a transgressor of the law, thy circumcision becomes uncircumcision,
045	ROM	002	026	If then the uncircumcision observe the righteous judgments of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be accounted for circumcision?
045	ROM	002	027	And the uncircumcision by nature which fulfilleth the law shall condemn thee, who through the letter and circumcision art a transgressor of the law.
045	ROM	002	028	For not he who is outwardly such, is the Jew; neither is that which is outward in the flesh, circumcision.
045	ROM	002	029	But he is a Jew who is such inwardly; and circumcision is of the heart, in spirit, not in letter; whose praise is not from men, but from God.
045	ROM	003	001	WHAT then is the superiority of the Jew? or what is the advantage of circumcision?
045	ROM	003	002	Much in every view: the principal one indeed is, that the oracles of God were entrusted to them.
045	ROM	003	003	For what if some were unbelievers? shall their unbelief render the faithfulness of God ineffectual?
045	ROM	003	004	God forbid: but let God be true, though every man were a liar; as it is written, “That thou mayest be acknowledged just in thy sayings, and overcome when thou art judged.”
045	ROM	003	005	But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is not God unrighteous in inflicting wrath? (I speak humanly).
045	ROM	003	006	God forbid: for how then shall God judge the world?
045	ROM	003	007	For if the truth of God by my lying hath more abundantly contributed to his glory; why am I notwithstanding judged as a sinner?
045	ROM	003	008	And why not admit, (as we are falsely reported of; and as some affirm we say, ) That we should do evil things, that good may come? whose condemnation is just.
045	ROM	003	009	What then? have we pre-eminence? Not at all: for we have before proved that both the Jews and Greeks are all under sin;
045	ROM	003	010	as it is written, “There is not a just person, no not one:
045	ROM	003	011	there is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.
045	ROM	003	012	All are turned aside together, they are become worthless; there is none that doeth good, there is not even one.
045	ROM	003	013	Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have spoken craftily; the poison of asps is under their lips:
045	ROM	003	014	whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:
045	ROM	003	015	their feet are swift to shed blood:
045	ROM	003	016	destruction and misery are in their ways.
045	ROM	003	017	And they have not known the way of peace:
045	ROM	003	018	there is not the fear of God before their eyes.”
045	ROM	003	019	Now we know that whatsoever things the law saith, it speaks to those who are under the law: that every mouth might be sealed up, and all the world become criminal before God.
045	ROM	003	020	Wherefore by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified before God: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.
045	ROM	003	021	But now distinct from the law the righteousness of God is manifest, receiving testimony from the law and the prophets;
045	ROM	003	022	the righteousness of God indeed by faith in Jesus Christ unto all and upon all that believe: for there is no difference:
045	ROM	003	023	for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;
045	ROM	003	024	justified freely by his grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus:
045	ROM	003	025	whom God hath proposed as the propitiatory sacrifice through faith in his blood, in demonstration of his justice for the remission of past sins, through the patience of God;
045	ROM	003	026	for a demonstration of his justice at this present time: that he might be just, though justifying him who is of the faith of Jesus.
045	ROM	003	027	Where then is boasting? It is excluded. By what law? of works? No: but by the law of faith.
045	ROM	003	028	We conclude therefore that by faith a man is justified, without works of law.
045	ROM	003	029	Is he the God of the Jews only, and is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, verily, of the Gentiles also:
045	ROM	003	030	since it is one God who will justify the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith.
045	ROM	003	031	Do we then abolish the law through faith? God forbid: but on the contrary, we give the law stability.
045	ROM	004	001	WHAT then shall we say that Abraham our father hath obtained by the flesh?
045	ROM	004	002	For if Abraham was justified by works, he hath cause for glorying; though not before God.
045	ROM	004	003	For what doth the scripture say? Abraham truly believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness.
045	ROM	004	004	Now to him that worketh, the reward is not brought to account as a favour, but as a debt.
045	ROM	004	005	But to him who doth not work, but believeth in him who justifieth the ungodly, his faith is reckoned in account for righteousness.
045	ROM	004	006	As David also describeth the blessedness of that man, to whom God imputeth righteousness without works,
045	ROM	004	007	“Blessed are they whose unrighteousnesses are forgiven, and whose sins are covered up.
045	ROM	004	008	Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will in nowise impute sin.”
045	ROM	004	009	This blessedness then, is it for the circumcision, or for the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was imputed to Abraham for righteousness.
045	ROM	004	010	How then was it imputed to him? when circumcised, or while uncircumcised? Not when circumcised, but whilst uncircumcised.
045	ROM	004	011	And he received the sign of circumcision, as a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had when uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all those who believe, though uncircumcised; that to them also the righteousness might be imputed:
045	ROM	004	012	and the father of circumcision, not to those who are of the circumcision merely, but who also tread in the steps of the faith of our father Abraham, which he exercised while uncircumcised.
045	ROM	004	013	For not by the law came the promise to Abraham and his seed, that he should be heir of the world, but by the righteousness of faith.
045	ROM	004	014	For if they who are of the law are heirs, faith becomes vain, and the promise is useless:
045	ROM	004	015	for the law causeth wrath: for where there is no law, neither is there transgression.
045	ROM	004	016	Therefore it is by faith, that it might be of grace; in order that the promise might be secured to all the seed; not only to that which is of the law, but to that which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,
045	ROM	004	017	(as it is written “that I have constituted thee father of many nations,”) before God, in whom he trusted, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth things that are not as if existing.
045	ROM	004	018	Who contrary to hope, in hope believed, that he should be the father of many nations, according to what was said, “So shall thy seed be.”
045	ROM	004	019	And not being weak in faith, he regarded not his own body now deadened, being about an hundred years old, nor the deadness of Sarah’s womb:
045	ROM	004	020	for he disputed not against the promise of God with unbelief; but was mighty in faith, giving glory to God;
045	ROM	004	021	and enjoyed the fullest assurance, that what he had promised, he was able also to perform.
045	ROM	004	022	And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.
045	ROM	004	023	Now it was not written for his sake only, that it was imputed to him;
045	ROM	004	024	but also for our sakes, to whom it will be imputed, if we believe in him who raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;
045	ROM	004	025	who was delivered up for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.
045	ROM	005	001	BEING justified therefore by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:
045	ROM	005	002	by whom also we have had an introduction through faith into this grace in which we have stood fast, and are rejoicing in hope of the glory of God.
045	ROM	005	003	And not only so, but we glory also in tribulations: knowing that tribulation produceth patience;
045	ROM	005	004	and patience, proof; and proof, hope;
045	ROM	005	005	and hope doth not make us ashamed; because the love of God is poured out into our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us.
045	ROM	005	006	For even then when we were without strength, Christ died in due time for the ungodly.
045	ROM	005	007	For scarcely for a righteous person will any one die: though for a good man perhaps some one might even dare to die.
045	ROM	005	008	But God commendeth his own love towards us, that, though we were yet sinners, Christ died in our stead.
045	ROM	005	009	Therefore much more, being justified already by his blood, shall we be saved by him from wrath.
045	ROM	005	010	For if, being enemies, we have been reconciled to God by the death of his son, much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.
045	ROM	005	011	And not so only, but we exult in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom already we have received reconciliation.
045	ROM	005	012	Therefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and by sin death; even so death passed into all men through him, in whom all have sinned.
045	ROM	005	013	For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed if there be no law.
045	ROM	005	014	But death reigned from Adam unto Moses, even over those who have not sinned after the similitude of the transgression of Adam, who is a type of him that was to come.
045	ROM	005	015	But not as the transgression, so also is the gift. For if by the transgression of one the many became dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is in that one man, Christ Jesus, hath abounded unto many.
045	ROM	005	016	And the gift is not as for one who sinned: for the judgment indeed came by one to condemnation, but the free gift leads to justification from many offences.
045	ROM	005	017	For if by the offence of one, death reigned by that one; much more they who receive the abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteousness, shall reign in life by one, Christ Jesus.
045	ROM	005	018	Well then, as by the offence of one, judgment issued against all men unto condemnation; so also by the righteousness of one, the gift came to all men for justification unto life.
045	ROM	005	019	For as by the disobedience of one man the many were constituted sinners; so also by the obedience of one shall the many be constituted righteous.
045	ROM	005	020	But the law was introduced, that the offence might be more abundant. But where sin had abounded, there hath grace abounded more exceedingly:
045	ROM	005	021	that as sin had reigned by death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto life eternal by Jesus Christ our Lord.
045	ROM	006	001	THAT then shall we say? Shall we abide in sin, that grace may abound?
045	ROM	006	002	God forbid. We who are dead to sin, how shall we still live therein?
045	ROM	006	003	Do ye not know, that as many as have been baptised into Christ Jesus have been baptised into his death?
045	ROM	006	004	We have been buried therefore with him by baptism into death: that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so also we should walk in newness of life.
045	ROM	006	005	For if we have been planted with him in the likeness of his death, so shall we be also of his resurrection:
045	ROM	006	006	knowing this, that our old man hath been crucified with him, that the body of sin might be abolished, that we should no longer be slaves to sin.
045	ROM	006	007	For he that is dead is discharged from sin.
045	ROM	006	008	But if we have been dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:
045	ROM	006	009	knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death over him hath no more dominion.
045	ROM	006	010	For in that he died, for sin he died once: but in that he liveth, he liveth to God.
045	ROM	006	011	So also do ye account yourselves dead indeed to sin, but living unto God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
045	ROM	006	012	Let not therefore sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in the passions thereof.
045	ROM	006	013	Neither present your members as weapons of unrighteousness for sin: but present yourselves to God, as alive from the dead, and your members as weapons of righteousness for God.
045	ROM	006	014	For sin shall not hold dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.
045	ROM	006	015	What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.
045	ROM	006	016	Do ye not know, that to whomsoever ye present yourselves servants to obey, ye are his servants to whom ye obey; if of sin unto death, or of obedience, unto righteousness?
045	ROM	006	017	But thanks be to God, that though ye were the servants of sin, ye have obeyed from the heart the model of doctrine into which ye were delivered.
045	ROM	006	018	Emancipated then from sin, ye became servants to righteousness.
045	ROM	006	019	I speak humanly, because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have presented your members servants to impurity and iniquity for iniquity; so now present your members servants to righteousness for holiness.
045	ROM	006	020	For when ye were the slaves of sin, ye were free from righteousness.
045	ROM	006	021	What fruit therefore had ye then in those things at which ye are now confounded? for the end of those things is death.
045	ROM	006	022	But now being set at liberty from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and at the end life eternal.
045	ROM	006	023	For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is life eternal in Jesus Christ our Lord.
045	ROM	007	001	ARE you unacquainted, brethren, (for I am speaking to those who know the law, ) that the law exercises dominion over a person for as long time as he liveth?
045	ROM	007	002	For the woman who is subject to a husband, is bound by the law to that husband during his life; but if the husband be dead, she is discharged from that husband.
045	ROM	007	003	She shall therefore certainly be counted an adulteress, if, her husband being alive, she be for another man: but if her husband is dead, she is free from the law; so that she shall be no adulteress, though married to another husband.
045	ROM	007	004	Wherefore, my brethren, ye also have become dead to the law through the body of Christ; that ye might be for another, who was raised from the dead, that we might bring forth fruit for God.
045	ROM	007	005	For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions excited by the law, wrought powerfully in our members, to bring forth fruit unto death.
045	ROM	007	006	But now we have been discharged from the law, that being dead by which we were held fast; that we should serve in renovation of spirit, and not in the antiquity of the letter.
045	ROM	007	007	What then shall we say? Is the law sin? God forbid. Yea, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not even known concupiscence, unless the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.
045	ROM	007	008	But sin, seizing the opportunity by the law, wrought in me all concupiscence. For without the law sin is dead.
045	ROM	007	009	For though I lived without the law formerly; yet when the commandment came, sin revived, but I died.
045	ROM	007	010	And the commandment, which was for life, the same was found by me for death.
045	ROM	007	011	For sin, seizing the occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and thereby slew me.
045	ROM	007	012	So then the law indeed is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.
045	ROM	007	013	Did then that which is good become fatal to me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin by that which was good in itself, was the cause of death to me; that sin through the commandment might become transcendantly sinful.
045	ROM	007	014	For we know that the law is spiritual; but I am fleshly, sold under sin.
045	ROM	007	015	For that which I am doing I approve not: for not the thing which I wish, that do I practise; but the very thing I hate, that I do.
045	ROM	007	016	But if what I would not, that I do, I concur with the law that it is excellent.
045	ROM	007	017	Now then no more I do this, but sin dwelling in me.
045	ROM	007	018	For I know that there dwelleth not in me (that is, in my flesh) any good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.
045	ROM	007	019	For I do not the good which I wish: but the evil which I would not, that I do.
045	ROM	007	020	If then I do that which I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
045	ROM	007	021	I find then a law, that, when I wish to do good, evil is presented to me.
045	ROM	007	022	For I am delighted with the law of God, as respecting the inward man:
045	ROM	007	023	but I see another law in my members, militating against the law in my mind, and making me captive to the law of sin which is in my members.
045	ROM	007	024	O wretched man, I! who shall pluck me from the body of this death?
045	ROM	007	025	I give thanks to God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Well then, I myself with my mind am servant to the law of God; but in my flesh to the law of sin.
045	ROM	008	001	THERE is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
045	ROM	008	002	For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath liberated me from the law of sin and of death.
045	ROM	008	003	For that which was impossible by the law, inasmuch as it was impotent through the flesh, God having sent his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in that flesh:
045	ROM	008	004	that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled by us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
045	ROM	008	005	For they who are after the flesh, mind the things of the flesh; but they who are after the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.
045	ROM	008	006	For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.
045	ROM	008	007	Because the propensity of the flesh is inimical against God: for it is not in subjection to the law of God, neither indeed can it be.
045	ROM	008	008	They then who are in the flesh, cannot please God.
045	ROM	008	009	But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwelleth in you. But if any man hath not the Spirit of Christ, he is not his.
045	ROM	008	010	But if Christ be in you, the body indeed is dead on account of sin; but the Spirit is alive through righteousness.
045	ROM	008	011	But if the Spirit of him who hath raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he who raised Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his indwelling Spirit in you.
045	ROM	008	012	Truly then we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.
045	ROM	008	013	For if ye live after the flesh, ye are ready to die: but if by the Spirit ye mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.
045	ROM	008	014	For as many as are guided by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
045	ROM	008	015	For ye have not received a spirit of bondage again unto fear; but ye have received a Spirit of adoption, by which we cry, Abba, Father.
045	ROM	008	016	The same spirit beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God.
045	ROM	008	017	But if children, then heirs; heirs indeed of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be we suffer with him, that we may also together with him be glorified.
045	ROM	008	018	For I reckon that the sufferings of the present moment are not worthy to be placed against the future glory that shall be revealed to us.
045	ROM	008	019	For the eager expectation of the creation is waiting for the revelation of the children of God.
045	ROM	008	020	For the creation was made subject to vanity, not voluntarily, but by him who made it subject,
045	ROM	008	021	in hope that the same creation shall be emancipated from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.
045	ROM	008	022	For we know that the whole creation groaneth together and travaileth in birth to this moment.
045	ROM	008	023	And not only so, but ourselves also, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan in ourselves, expecting the adoption, the redemption of our body.
045	ROM	008	024	For by hope we have been saved: now hope seen is not hope; for that which any man seeth how doth he yet hope for?
045	ROM	008	025	But if we hope for what we see not, we with patience expect it.
045	ROM	008	026	In like manner also the Spirit affords assistance to our infirmities: for even this, what we should pray for as we ought, we know not: but the same Spirit more abundantly maketh intercession for us with groanings unutterable.
045	ROM	008	027	Now he that trieth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, for he maketh intercession for the saints according to God’s will.
045	ROM	008	028	But we know that to those who love God all things work together for good, even to those who are called according to his purpose.
045	ROM	008	029	For whom he foreknew, he predestinated also to a conformity with the image of his Son, that he might be the first-begotten among many brethren.
045	ROM	008	030	But whom he predestinated, those also he called: and whom he called, those also he justified: but whom he justified, those also he glorified.
045	ROM	008	031	What then shall we say to these things? If God be for us, who shall be against us?
045	ROM	008	032	He who even spared not his own Son, but freely delivered him up for us all, how shall he not also, together with him, freely give us all things?
045	ROM	008	033	Who shall put in an accusation against the elect of God? God? He is their justifier.
045	ROM	008	034	Who is he that condemneth? Christ? He died, yea, rather, also is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.
045	ROM	008	035	Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall distress of circumstances, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or the sword?
045	ROM	008	036	As it is written, “That for thy sake we have been put to death the whole day long; we have been reckoned indeed as sheep for slaughter.”
045	ROM	008	037	But in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.
045	ROM	008	038	For I am assured that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor those to come,
045	ROM	008	039	nor exaltation, nor deepest depression, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
045	ROM	009	001	I SPEAK the truth in Christ, I lie not, (my conscience also bearing witness to me in the Holy Ghost, )
045	ROM	009	002	that great is my sorrow and unceasing the anguish in my heart.
045	ROM	009	003	For could I myself wish that an anathema should be from Christ upon my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh?
045	ROM	009	004	who are Israelites; whose is the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the gift of the law, and the sacred service, and the promises;
045	ROM	009	005	of whom are the fathers, and from whom as respecting the flesh Christ sprung, who is over all, the blessed God for evermore. Amen.
045	ROM	009	006	Now it is not supposable that the word of God hath failed. For these are not all Israel, who are of Israel:
045	ROM	009	007	nor, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
045	ROM	009	008	That is, not the children of the flesh, these are the children of God: but the children of the promise are accounted for the seed.
045	ROM	009	009	For the word of promise is this, At that time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son.
045	ROM	009	010	And not only so; but when Rebecca also had conception by one, even Isaac our father;
045	ROM	009	011	(though the children were not yet born, nor had done any thing good or evil, that according to the election of God the purpose might abide, not from works, but from him who called; )
045	ROM	009	012	it was said unto her, “That the elder shall be servant to the younger.”
045	ROM	009	013	As it is written, “Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.”
045	ROM	009	014	What shall we say therefore? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.
045	ROM	009	015	For he saith to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.”
045	ROM	009	016	Well then, it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God who sheweth mercy.
045	ROM	009	017	For the scripture saith to Pharaoh, “That for this very end have I raised thee up, that I might display in thee my power, and that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth.”
045	ROM	009	018	Well then, he hath mercy on whom he will, but whom he will he hardeneth.
045	ROM	009	019	Wilt thou then say to me, Why yet doth he blame us? Who hath resisted his will?
045	ROM	009	020	Nay but, O man, who art thou that disputest against God? Shall the thing fashioned say to him that fashioned it, Why hast thou made me thus?
045	ROM	009	021	Hath not the potter power over the clay, from the same mass to make one vessel for an honourable use, and another for a dishonourable?
045	ROM	009	022	But what if God, willing to display his wrath, and to make known what is possible with him, hath borne with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted for perdition:
045	ROM	009	023	and that he might make known the riches of his glory upon the vessels of mercy which he had before prepared for glory:
045	ROM	009	024	even us, whom he hath called, not only out of the Jews, but out of the Gentiles?
045	ROM	009	025	As also he saith in Hosea, “I will call her which was not my people, my people; and her which was not beloved, beloved.
045	ROM	009	026	And it shall be in the place where it was said unto them, ye are not my people; there shall they be called the sons of the living God.”
045	ROM	009	027	But Isaiah crieth concerning Israel, “Though the number of the sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:
045	ROM	009	028	for he will finish the account, and cut it short in righteousness: because a concise account will the Lord make on the earth.”
045	ROM	009	029	Even as Isaiah had said before, “Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left unto us a seed, we should have become as Sodom, and been made like unto Gomorrha.”
045	ROM	009	030	What then shall we say? That the Gentiles, who pursued not after righteousness, have attained unto righteousness, even the righteousness which is by faith.
045	ROM	009	031	But Israel, pursuing after the law of righteousness, hath not come up to the law of righteousness.
045	ROM	009	032	And why? Because they sought it not by faith, but as by the works of the law. For they stumbled against that stone of stumbling;
045	ROM	009	033	as it is written, “Behold, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence: and every one that believeth in him shall not be confounded.”
045	ROM	010	001	BRETHREN, the kind wish of my heart indeed, and the prayer which I offer to God for Israel, is for their salvation.
045	ROM	010	002	For I am a witness for them, that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.
045	ROM	010	003	For being ignorant of the righteousness which is of God, and seeking to establish a righteousness of their own, they have not submitted to the righteousness of God.
045	ROM	010	004	For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.
045	ROM	010	005	For Moses describeth the righteousness which is by the law, “That the man who doeth these things shall live by them.”
045	ROM	010	006	But the righteousness that is by faith speaketh thus, “Say not in thy heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down: )
045	ROM	010	007	or, Who shall descend into the abyss?” (that is, to bring Christ up again from the dead.)
045	ROM	010	008	But what saith it? “The word is nigh thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart:” that is, the word of faith which we preach;
045	ROM	010	009	That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thy heart that God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
045	ROM	010	010	For with the heart faith is exercised unto righteousness; and with the mouth is confession made unto salvation.
045	ROM	010	011	For the scripture saith, “Every one who believeth in him shall not be confounded.”
045	ROM	010	012	For there is no difference between either Jew or Greek: for the same Lord of all is rich to all that call upon him.
045	ROM	010	013	“For every one shall be saved, whosoever calleth on the name of the Lord.”
045	ROM	010	014	How then shall they call upon him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe on him of whom they have not heard? but how shall they hear without a preacher?
045	ROM	010	015	and how shall they preach unless they are sent? as it is written, “How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace, of those who preach the glad tidings of good things!”
045	ROM	010	016	But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah saith, “Lord, who hath believed our report?”
045	ROM	010	017	Faith then cometh by report, but the report by the word of God.
045	ROM	010	018	But I say, Have they not heard? Yea verily, “the sound of their voice is gone forth into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.”
045	ROM	010	019	But I say, Did not Israel know? Moses first saith, “I will excite your jealousy by what is no nation, and by an ignorant people will I provoke you to wrath.”
045	ROM	010	020	But Isaiah is very bold, and saith, “I have been found by those who sought me not; I have become manifest to those who inquired not after me.”
045	ROM	010	021	But unto Israel he saith, “All the day long have I stretched out my hands unto a people disobedient and contradicting.”
045	ROM	011	001	I SAY then, Hath God rejected his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
045	ROM	011	002	God hath not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Know ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession with God against Israel, saying,
045	ROM	011	003	“Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I only am left, and they seek my life.”
045	ROM	011	004	But what saith the oracle of God to him? “I have left to myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.”
045	ROM	011	005	So then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.
045	ROM	011	006	But if by grace, it is no more by works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if by works, it is no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.
045	ROM	011	007	What then is the result? Israel hath not obtained that which it seeketh; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded,
045	ROM	011	008	as it is written, “God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear; unto this present day.”
045	ROM	011	009	And David saith, “Let their table be for a snare, and for a trap, and for a stumbling-block, and for a recompence unto them:
045	ROM	011	010	let their eyes be blinded, that they may not see, and bow down their back continually.”
045	ROM	011	011	I say then, Have they stumbled so as to fall? God forbid: but by their stumbling salvation is come to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.
045	ROM	011	012	For if their stumbling is the riches of the world, and their diminution the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?
045	ROM	011	013	For I address myself to you Gentiles; inasmuch as I am indeed the apostle of the Gentiles, I exalt my ministry:
045	ROM	011	014	if by any means I might provoke to jealousy my flesh, and save some of them.
045	ROM	011	015	For if the rejection of them is the reconciliation of the world, what shall their recovery be, but life from the dead?
045	ROM	011	016	Now if the first fruits be holy, so is the mass: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.
045	ROM	011	017	But if some of the branches have been broken off, and thou though a wild olive hast been grafted in among them, and become a partaker of the root and fatness of the olive tree;
045	ROM	011	018	boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.
045	ROM	011	019	Wilt thou say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in?
045	ROM	011	020	Admitted; by unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not high minded, but fear:
045	ROM	011	021	for if God spared not the native branches, tremble lest he spare not thee.
045	ROM	011	022	Behold therefore the kindness and severity of God: to those indeed who fell, severity; but unto thee, kindness, if thou continuest in that kindness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.
045	ROM	011	023	But they also, if they continue not in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.
045	ROM	011	024	For if thou hast been cut out of the naturally wild olive, and contrary to nature hast been grafted into the good olive: how much more shall these, which are native branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?
045	ROM	011	025	For I would not that you should be ignorant, brethren, of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is come on Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.
045	ROM	011	026	And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, “The Deliverer shall go forth out of Sion, and shalt turn away ungodliness from Jacob;
045	ROM	011	027	and this is my covenant with them, When I shall take away their sins.”
045	ROM	011	028	As concerning the gospel indeed, they are now enemies for your sakes: as concerning the election, they are beloved for the fathers’ sake.
045	ROM	011	029	For unchangeable are the gifts and the calling of God.
045	ROM	011	030	For as ye also in times past did not believe in God, but now have obtained mercy through their unbelief:
045	ROM	011	031	so also these now have not believed in your mercy, that they also might obtain mercy.
045	ROM	011	032	For God hath shut up all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.
045	ROM	011	033	O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and how incomprehensible his ways!
045	ROM	011	034	For who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been admitted his counsellor?
045	ROM	011	035	Or who hath first given unto him, and it shall be repaid him again?
045	ROM	011	036	Because by him, and through him, and for him, are all things, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
045	ROM	012	001	I BESEECH you, therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.
045	ROM	012	002	And be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renovation of your mind, that you may prove by experience what is the will of God, that is good, acceptable, and perfect.
045	ROM	012	003	For, I say, by the grace which is given unto me, to every one that is among you, not to think of himself above what he ought to think; but to think soberly, as God has divided to every one the measure of faith.
045	ROM	012	004	For as we have in one body many members, but the members, though many, have not the same function,
045	ROM	012	005	so we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one reciprocally members of each other.
045	ROM	012	006	Having then different gifts according to the grace which is given unto us, if it be prophecy, speak according to the analogy of faith;
045	ROM	012	007	or if the deacon’s office, be active in the service; or he that teacheth, in teaching;
045	ROM	012	008	or he that exhorteth, in exhortation; he that distributes, let him do it with simplicity; he that presideth, with diligence; he that is employed in acts of mercy, with cheerfulness.
045	ROM	012	009	Let love be undissembled. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.
045	ROM	012	010	In brotherly affection be tenderly attached to each other; in honour preferring one another:
045	ROM	012	011	not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord:
045	ROM	012	012	rejoicing in hope; patient in affliction; persevering in prayer:
045	ROM	012	013	communicating to the wants of the saints; prompt to hospitality.
045	ROM	012	014	Bless them who persecute you; bless, and curse not.
045	ROM	012	015	Rejoice with those that rejoice, and weep with those that weep.
045	ROM	012	016	Be of the same mind among each other. Affect not high things, but be condescending to the lowly. Be not wise in your own conceits.
045	ROM	012	017	Render to no man evil for evil. Be provident of things laudable in the sight of all men.
045	ROM	012	018	If possible, as far as you can, be at peace with all men.
045	ROM	012	019	Avenge not yourselves, beloved, but give place unto wrath: for it is written, “Vengeance belongeth to me; I will recompence, saith the Lord.”
045	ROM	012	020	If therefore thine enemy hunger, give him food; if he thirst, give him drink: for so doing, thou shalt heap up coals of fire on his head.
045	ROM	012	021	Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.
045	ROM	013	001	LET every soul be subject to the superior powers: for there is no power but from God; the existing powers are appointed by God.
045	ROM	013	002	Wherefore he that sets himself against authority, resists the ordinance of God: and they who resist shall receive to themselves condemnation.
045	ROM	013	003	For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise from it:
045	ROM	013	004	for he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou doest that which is evil, tremble! for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, an avenger to inflict wrath on him that practises what is evil.
045	ROM	013	005	Wherefore there is a necessity for being in subjection, not only for fear of wrath, but also for conscience sake.
045	ROM	013	006	For on this account pay ye taxes also: for they are God’s ministers, continually employed on this very service.
045	ROM	013	007	Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due, custom to whom custom, fear to whom fear, honour to whom honour.
045	ROM	013	008	Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.
045	ROM	013	009	For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is comprised in this word, even in this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
045	ROM	013	010	Love doeth no ill to a neighbour; the fulfilment therefore of the law is love.
045	ROM	013	011	And thus do, knowing the time; for the hour is come that we should awake from sleep, for now our salvation is nearer than when we believed.
045	ROM	013	012	The night is far advanced, the day approaches: let us therefore put off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.
045	ROM	013	013	Let us walk becomingly as in the face of day, not in revels and drunkenness, not in impurities and wantonness, not in strife and envy.
045	ROM	013	014	But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to gratify its passions.
045	ROM	014	001	HIM that is weak in faith take by the hand, and enter not into niceties of disputes.
045	ROM	014	002	One man indeed thinketh he may eat all meats; another, who is weak, eateth vegetables.
045	ROM	014	003	Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not, and let not him that eateth not judge him that eateth; for God hath accepted him.
045	ROM	014	004	Who art thou that judgest another man’s servant? To his own master he standeth or falleth; but he shall be established: for God is able to establish him.
045	ROM	014	005	One man judgeth one day different from another day: another judgeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.
045	ROM	014	006	He that observeth a day, to the Lord he observeth it; and he that observeth not a day, to the Lord he doth not observe it. He that eateth, to the Lord he eateth, for he giveth thanks to God; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth thanks to God.
045	ROM	014	007	For no one of us liveth to himself, and no one dieth to himself.
045	ROM	014	008	For whether we live, to the Lord we live, and whether we die, to the Lord we die; whether therefore we live, or whether we die, we are the Lord’s.
045	ROM	014	009	For to this end Christ both died, and rose again, and revived, that he might be the Lord both of the dead and of the living.
045	ROM	014	010	But thou, why judgest thou thy brother? And thou, why dost thou disparage thy brother? for we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ.
045	ROM	014	011	For it is written, “As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall make confession to God.”
045	ROM	014	012	Assuredly then every one of us shall give an account of himself to God.
045	ROM	014	013	Let us therefore no more judge one another; but judge this rather, that no one put a stumbling-block or offence before his brother.
045	ROM	014	014	I know, and am convinced by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself; but to him who thinketh any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.
045	ROM	014	015	But if by meat thy brother is grieved, thou walkest no more according to love. Do not by thy meat destroy him for whom Christ died.
045	ROM	014	016	Let not therefore food, which is good for you, give occasion of reproach.
045	ROM	014	017	For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.
045	ROM	014	018	For he who in these things is the servant of Christ, is acceptable to God, and approved of men.
045	ROM	014	019	Well then, let us earnestly pursue the things that conduce to peace, and the things which are for mutual edification.
045	ROM	014	020	For the sake of meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are clean; but it is an evil thing for a man to eat, giving offence.
045	ROM	014	021	It is laudable not to eat flesh, or to drink wine, nor to do any thing whereby thy brother is stumbled, or scandalized, or weakened.
045	ROM	014	022	Hast thou faith, exercise it before God within thyself. Blessed is the man who condemneth not himself in that which he alloweth.
045	ROM	014	023	But he that maketh a difference between meats, if he eat is condemned, because he doth it not by faith: for every thing which is not of faith, is sin.
045	ROM	015	001	WE then that are strong, ought to bear the infirmities of those who are feeble, and not to gratify ourselves.
045	ROM	015	002	Let every one of us gratify his neighbour in that which is good for his edification.
045	ROM	015	003	For even Christ gratified not himself; but as it is written, “The reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.”
045	ROM	015	004	For whatsoever things were written aforetime, were written for our instruction; that by patience and the consolation of the Scriptures we might have hope.
045	ROM	015	005	Now the God of patience and consolation give you to be like-minded among each other, according to Christ Jesus:
045	ROM	015	006	that in one mind, with one mouth, ye may glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
045	ROM	015	007	Therefore help one another, as Christ also hath helped us, for the glory of God.
045	ROM	015	008	Now I say that Jesus Christ was the minister of circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers:
045	ROM	015	009	and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, “For this cause will I confess unto thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name.”
045	ROM	015	010	And again he saith, “Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.”
045	ROM	015	011	And again, “Praise the Lord, all ye nations, and laud him, all ye people.”
045	ROM	015	012	And again Isaiah saith, “There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that ariseth to reign over the Gentiles, in him shall the Gentiles trust.”
045	ROM	015	013	Now the God of hope fill you with all joy, and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Ghost.
045	ROM	015	014	And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, and able to admonish one another.
045	ROM	015	015	But I have written to you, my brethren, in part, with greater freedom, as refreshing your memory through the grace which is given to me of God;
045	ROM	015	016	that I should be the minister of Jesus Christ unto the Gentiles, ministering the Gospel of God; that the oblation of the Gentiles might be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Ghost.
045	ROM	015	017	I have therefore cause to glory in Christ Jesus with regard to the things of God.
045	ROM	015	018	For I will not dare to say any thing of those things which Christ hath not wrought by my ministry, to engage the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed,
045	ROM	015	019	by the power of signs and miracles, by the might of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and in a circle quite round unto Illyricum, I have fully spread the gospel of Christ.
045	ROM	015	020	But I have in such manner endeavoured to preach the gospel, not where Christ’s name had been heard, lest I should build upon another man’s foundation:
045	ROM	015	021	but as it is written, “To whom the tidings concerning him have not reached, they shall see, and they who have not heard, shall understand.”
045	ROM	015	022	Wherefore also I have found many things to hinder me from coming to you;
045	ROM	015	023	but now having no longer cause to detain me in these regions, and having an earnest desire to come unto you for many years past,
045	ROM	015	024	whenever I proceed on my journey into Spain, I will come unto you: for I hope on my journey to see you, and by you to be forwarded thither, after I shall have first, in a measure, fully enjoyed your society.
045	ROM	015	025	But I am now going to Jerusalem, to carry alms to the saints.
045	ROM	015	026	For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make a certain contribution for the poor of the saints that are at Jerusalem.
045	ROM	015	027	They have been so pleased indeed, and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been admitted to a participation in their spiritual things, they ought also to minister to them in carnal things.
045	ROM	015	028	When therefore I have completed this work, and sealed unto them this fruit, I will pass by you into Spain.
045	ROM	015	029	But I know that, when I come to you, I shall come with the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.
045	ROM	015	030	Now I exhort you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that you wrestle earnestly with me in prayers for me unto God;
045	ROM	015	031	that I may be delivered from those who do not believe in Judea; and that my service which regards Jerusalem may be kindly accepted by the saints;
045	ROM	015	032	that I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may be refreshed together with you.
045	ROM	015	033	Now the God of peace be with you all! Amen.
045	ROM	016	001	I NOW commend unto you Phoebe our sister, who is a deaconess of the church which is at Cenchrea:
045	ROM	016	002	that ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that you assist her in every matter wherein she may have need of you: for she hath also been a succourer of many, and of me myself.
045	ROM	016	003	Salute Priscilla and Aquila my fellow-labourers in Christ Jesus:
045	ROM	016	004	(who for my life have laid down their own neck: to whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles: )
045	ROM	016	005	and the church which is in their house. Salute Epinetus my beloved, who is the first-fruits of Achaia unto Christ.
045	ROM	016	006	Salute Mary, who laboured in many things to serve us.
045	ROM	016	007	Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and fellow-prisoners, who are eminent among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.
045	ROM	016	008	Salute Amplias my beloved in the Lord.
045	ROM	016	009	Salute Urban, our fellow-labourer in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.
045	ROM	016	010	Salute Apelles the approved in Christ. Salute those who are of the family of Aristobulus.
045	ROM	016	011	Salute Herodion my kinsman. Salute those which belong to the family of Narcissus, who are in the Lord.
045	ROM	016	012	Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who have laboured hard in the Lord. Salute Persis the beloved, who laboured much in the Lord.
045	ROM	016	013	Salute Rufus elect in the Lord, and his mother and mine.
045	ROM	016	014	Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Dermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren which are with them.
045	ROM	016	015	Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints with them.
045	ROM	016	016	Salute one another with the holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute you.
045	ROM	016	017	Now I beseech you, brethren, keep a sharp eye over those who cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine ye have learned, and turn away from them.
045	ROM	016	018	For such are not servants to our Lord Jesus Christ, but to their own belly; and by smooth speeches and flattering commendations deceive the hearts of the guileless.
045	ROM	016	019	For your obedience is gone forth in report to all men. I rejoice therefore on your account: but I wish you to be wise indeed unto good, but harmless respecting evil.
045	ROM	016	020	Now the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
045	ROM	016	021	There salute you Timothy, my fellow-labourer, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen.
045	ROM	016	022	I Tertius, who have written this epistle, salute you in the Lord.
045	ROM	016	023	Gaius mine host, and of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you, and Quartus a brother.
045	ROM	016	024	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
045	ROM	016	025	Now to him that is able to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, agreeable to the revelation of the mystery; which was concealed from all former ages,
045	ROM	016	026	but is now made manifest, and by the prophetical scriptures, according to the commandment of the eternal God, notified to all the Gentiles to bring them to the obedience of faith:
045	ROM	016	027	to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, be glory for ever and ever. Amen. Written to the Romans, and sent by Phoebe, a deaconess of the church in Cenchrea.

046	1CO	001	004	I give thanks to my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which hath been given you in Christ Jesus;
046	1CO	001	005	that in every thing ye have been enriched by him, in all utterance, and all knowledge;
046	1CO	001	006	thus the testimony of Jesus hath been confirmed among you:
046	1CO	001	007	so that ye have not been deficient in any gift; waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ:
046	1CO	001	008	who shall confirm you to the end blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
046	1CO	001	009	Faithful is God, by whom ye have been called into communion with his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
046	1CO	001	010	Now I conjure you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no schisms among you; but that ye be perfectly united together in the same mind and the same sentiment.
046	1CO	001	011	For I have been informed concerning you, my brethren, by those of the family of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.
046	1CO	001	012	Now this I observe, that one and another of you saith, I am indeed of Paul; but I of Apollos; but I of Cephas; but I am of Christ.
046	1CO	001	013	Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptised into the name of Paul?
046	1CO	001	014	I thank God that I baptised none of you, except Crispus and Gaius;
046	1CO	001	015	that no man might say, I baptised into my own name.
046	1CO	001	016	And I also baptised the household of Stephanus: besides these, I know not if I baptised any other person.
046	1CO	001	017	For Christ sent me not to baptise, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of discourse, lest the cross of Christ should be slighted.
046	1CO	001	018	For the discourse, the subject of which is the cross, is indeed to those who perish, folly; but to us who are saved it is the power of God.
046	1CO	001	019	For it is written, “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the understanding of the intelligent will I make useless.”
046	1CO	001	020	Where is the sophist? where is the scribe? where is the inquisitive searcher after this world’s wisdom? hath not God turned into folly the wisdom of this world?
046	1CO	001	021	for since in the wisdom of God the world by its wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.
046	1CO	001	022	For the Jews demand a miracle, and the Greeks seek wisdom:
046	1CO	001	023	but we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews indeed an offence, and to the Greeks folly;
046	1CO	001	024	but to those who are called, whether Jews or Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.
046	1CO	001	025	For this foolishness of God is wiser than men; and this weakness of God is stronger than men.
046	1CO	001	026	For ye see your calling, brethren, that not many fleshly wise, not many men in power, not many men of high birth, are called:
046	1CO	001	027	but the foolish things of this world hath God elected, that he might confound the wise; and the feeble things of the world hath God elected, that he might confound the mighty;
046	1CO	001	028	and the ignoble things of the world, and the despicable, hath God elected, and the things that are not, to bring to nought the things which are,
046	1CO	001	029	that no flesh should glory in his presence.
046	1CO	001	030	But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who hath been made to us of God wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:
046	1CO	001	031	that, as it is written, “He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.”
046	1CO	002	001	AND I, when I came to you, brethren, came not with superior excellence of discourse or wisdom, preaching unto you the gospel of God.
046	1CO	002	002	For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ and him crucified.
046	1CO	002	003	And in weakness, and in fear, and in much timidity, was I among you.
046	1CO	002	004	And my conversation and my preaching was not with persuasive words of human wisdom, but with demonstration of the Spirit, and of power:
046	1CO	002	005	that your faith might not stand on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God.
046	1CO	002	006	But we speak wisdom among the perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who are destroying themselves:
046	1CO	002	007	but we speak the wisdom of God, which had been hid in mystery, which God predestined before the worlds were, for our glory:
046	1CO	002	008	which none of the rulers of this world have known: for if they had known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
046	1CO	002	009	But, as it is written, “The things which eye hath not seen, and ear hath not heard, and that have not entered into the heart of man, these hath God prepared for those who love him.”
046	1CO	002	010	But to us hath God revealed them by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth out all things, even the depths of God.
046	1CO	002	011	For who among men knoweth the things of man, save the spirit of man which is in him? so also the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.
046	1CO	002	012	Now we have not received the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is from God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.
046	1CO	002	013	Which things also we speak, not in discourses framed by human wisdom, but taught by the Spirit of God; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.
046	1CO	002	014	But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are folly to him: and he cannot know them, because they are spiritually discerned.
046	1CO	002	015	But the spiritual man discerneth indeed all things, though himself is discernible by no man.
046	1CO	002	016	For who hath known the mind of the Lord? who will instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.
046	1CO	003	001	AND I, brethren, have been unable to speak to you as unto spiritual men, but as to carnal, even as to babes in Christ.
046	1CO	003	002	And I have given you milk to drink, and not meat: for hitherto ye have not been capable of it, yea, even to the present moment ye are not capable of it.
046	1CO	003	003	For ye are still carnal: for since there are among you envy, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as other men?
046	1CO	003	004	For when one saith, I am indeed of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?
046	1CO	003	005	Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but the ministers through whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to each of us?
046	1CO	003	006	I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.
046	1CO	003	007	So then neither is he that planteth any thing, nor he that watereth; but God who giveth the increase.
046	1CO	003	008	Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: but every one shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.
046	1CO	003	009	For we are God’s fellowlabourers: ye are God’s husbandry, ye are God’s building.
046	1CO	003	010	According to the grace of God given unto me, as a skilful architect, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every one take heed how he buildeth upon it.
046	1CO	003	011	For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus the Messiah.
046	1CO	003	012	But if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, timbers, hay, stubble;
046	1CO	003	013	every man’s work shall be made manifest: for that day shall declare it, for it shall be laid open by fire; and the fire shall prove every man’s work of what sort it is.
046	1CO	003	014	If any man’s work which he hath built abide the trial, he shall receive a reward.
046	1CO	003	015	If any man’s work be burnt up, he shall suffer loss: but himself shall be saved; yet so as through the fire.
046	1CO	003	016	Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?
046	1CO	003	017	If any man prophane the temple of God, him will God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.
046	1CO	003	018	Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you thinketh himself a wise man in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.
046	1CO	003	019	For the wisdom of this world is folly in the sight of God. For it is written, “He entangleth the wise in their own craftiness.”
046	1CO	003	020	And again, “The Lord knoweth the reasonings of the wise, that they are futile.”
046	1CO	003	021	Wherefore let no man glory in men. For all things are your’s;
046	1CO	003	022	whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all things are your’s;
046	1CO	003	023	and ye are Christ’s; and Christ is God’s.
046	1CO	004	001	LET a man so account of us, as the under servants of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.
046	1CO	004	002	Moreover it is expected of stewards, that a man be found faithful.
046	1CO	004	003	But it is my least consideration that I should be judged by you, or by human opinion: yea I decide not respecting myself.
046	1CO	004	004	For though I am not conscious to myself of any unfaithfulness, yet am I not thereby justified; but he that judgeth me is the Lord.
046	1CO	004	005	Wherefore judge nothing before the time until the Lord come, who also will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will manifest the counsels of men’s hearts; and then shall praise be given to each from God.
046	1CO	004	006	But these things, brethren, I have figuratively applied to myself, and Apollos for your sake; that in us ye might learn not to be attached, beyond what is written, lest one being for one minister, ye be puffed up with prejudice against another.
046	1CO	004	007	For who distinguisheth thee? and what hast thou which thou hast not received? But if thou also hast received it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?
046	1CO	004	008	Now ye are full, now ye have grown rich, ye have reigned without us: and I wish indeed that you may reign, that we also might reign together with you.
046	1CO	004	009	For I think that God hath exposed us his apostles the last as devoted unto death. For we have been made a spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men.
046	1CO	004	010	We are counted fools for Christ’s sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are mighty; ye are honourable persons, but we despised.
046	1CO	004	011	For even to this present hour we undergo hunger and thirst and nakedness, and are buffeted about, and have no settled abode;
046	1CO	004	012	and work hard, labouring with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it;
046	1CO	004	013	being injuriously spoken of, we entreat; we are made as the ordures of the world, as the sweepings of all things unto this day.
046	1CO	004	014	I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved children I admonish you.
046	1CO	004	015	For though ye may have ten thousand teachers in Christ, yet not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus through the Gospel I have begotten you.
046	1CO	004	016	Now I conjure you, be followers of me.
046	1CO	004	017	For this cause have I sent unto you Timothy, who is my son beloved and faithful in Christ, who will remind you of my ways which are in Christ Jesus, as I teach every where in every church.
046	1CO	004	018	Now some are puffed up, as though I would not really come to you.
046	1CO	004	019	But I will come shortly unto you, if the Lord please, and will know, not the prating of them that are puffed up, but the power.
046	1CO	004	020	For the kingdom of God is not in talk, but in power.
046	1CO	004	021	What is your wish? That I should come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?
046	1CO	005	001	IT is generally reported that there is whoredom among you, and such whoredom as is not even named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father’s wife.
046	1CO	005	002	And ye are puffed up, though ought ye not rather to be grieved? that he who hath done this deed might be plucked from the midst of you.
046	1CO	005	003	For I indeed, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have already, as present, passed judgment on him who hath so done this thing;
046	1CO	005	004	in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, ye being assembled together and my spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
046	1CO	005	005	to deliver such a one over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
046	1CO	005	006	Your glorying is not good: know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole mass?
046	1CO	005	007	Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new mass, as ye are unleavened. For our passover hath been sacrificed for us, even Christ.
046	1CO	005	008	Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
046	1CO	005	009	I have written unto you in an epistle that you should not associate with fornicators.
046	1CO	005	010	Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or the covetous, or extortioners, or idolaters: for then must ye indeed go out of the world.
046	1CO	005	011	But now I have written unto you not to associate with him, if any man, professing to be a brother, be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner, with such a one not even to eat.
046	1CO	005	012	For what call have I to judge those who are without? Do not ye judge those who are within the church?
046	1CO	005	013	But those who are without God judgeth. Put then away that wicked man from among yourselves.
046	1CO	006	001	DARE any of you, having a matter of controversy with another, sue for judgment before the unjust, and not before the saints?
046	1CO	006	002	Know ye not that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to be judges in the smallest matters?
046	1CO	006	003	Know ye not that we shall judge angels, much more things pertaining to this life?
046	1CO	006	004	If then ye have disputes about the things of this life, do you seat those on the bench who are least esteemed in the church?
046	1CO	006	005	I speak to you to shame you. Is it so, that there is not among you a wise man? Not so much as one who is able to judge between one brother and another?
046	1CO	006	006	But brother goes to law with brother, and this before the unbelievers.
046	1CO	006	007	Now verily therefore there is altogether a fault among you, because ye have law-suits one with another. Why do ye not rather submit to the wrong? Why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?
046	1CO	006	008	But ye do wrong and defraud, and that the brethren.
046	1CO	006	009	Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor sodomites,
046	1CO	006	010	nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.
046	1CO	006	011	Yet such were some of you: but ye have been washed, but ye have been sanctified, but ye have been justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the spirit of our God.
046	1CO	006	012	All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient; all things are lawful for me, but I will not put myself under the power of any.
046	1CO	006	013	Meats are for the belly, and the belly for meats; but God will destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for whoredom, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.
046	1CO	006	014	And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will raise us up by his own power.
046	1CO	006	015	Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? Taking then the members of Christ, shall I make them members of an harlot? God forbid.
046	1CO	006	016	Do you not know that he that is joined to an harlot is one body with her? For they two, saith he, shall be “one flesh.”
046	1CO	006	017	But he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit.
046	1CO	006	018	Flee whoredom. Every other sin which a man may commit is without the body; but he who committeth whoredom sinneth against his own body.
046	1CO	006	019	Do ye not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you, which ye have from God, and ye are not your own?
046	1CO	006	020	For ye have been bought with a price: glorify then God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s.
046	1CO	007	001	NOW with regard to those things concerning which ye have written unto me, it were good for a man not to touch a woman.
046	1CO	007	002	But because of the whoredoms, let every man have his own wife, and every wife her own husband.
046	1CO	007	003	Let the husband render to the wife due benevolence, and in like manner also the wife to the husband.
046	1CO	007	004	The wife hath not power over her own body, but the husband: in like manner also the husband has not power over his own body, but the wife.
046	1CO	007	005	Defraud not one another, except it may be by consent occasionally, that ye may have more leisure for fasting and prayer; and come together again, lest Satan tempt you through your incontinence.
046	1CO	007	006	But in this I speak my opinion only, not authoritatively.
046	1CO	007	007	For I would that all men were even as myself: but every man hath his peculiar gift from God, one of this sort, and another of that.
046	1CO	007	008	I say then to the unmarried and the widows, that it is becoming them if they abide as I am.
046	1CO	007	009	But if they have not the gift of continence, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.
046	1CO	007	010	But to the married not I command, but the Lord, That the wife be not separated from the husband:
046	1CO	007	011	and even if she should be separated, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.
046	1CO	007	012	But to the others I speak, not the Lord, If any brother hath a wife unbelieving, yet she chuseth to dwell with him, let him not put her away.
046	1CO	007	013	And the wife which hath a husband not a believer, and he chuses to dwell with her, let her not put him away.
046	1CO	007	014	For the husband that believeth not is sanctified by the wife, and the wife who believeth not is sanctified by the husband: else indeed your children were unclean, but now are they holy.
046	1CO	007	015	But if the unbelieving person depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in these cases, but God hath called us unto peace.
046	1CO	007	016	For how knowest thou, O wife, but thou shalt save thy husband? and how knowest thou, O husband, but thou shalt save thy wife?
046	1CO	007	017	Nevertheless as God has bestowed the gift on every man as the Lord hath called every man, so let him walk, and so I give command in all the churches.
046	1CO	007	018	Is any man called being circumcised? let him not affect uncircumcision. Is any man called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.
046	1CO	007	019	Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the observance of the commandments of God.
046	1CO	007	020	Let every one abide in the calling in which he is called.
046	1CO	007	021	Art thou called being a slave? let it give thee no concern; but if thou canst also obtain thy freedom, rather make use of it.
046	1CO	007	022	For he that is called in the Lord, being a slave, is the Lord’s freed man: in like manner also, he that is called, being a free man, is the servant of Christ.
046	1CO	007	023	Have you been redeemed with a price? become not the slaves of men.
046	1CO	007	024	Let every one, brethren, in the vocation wherein he is called, therein abide with God.
046	1CO	007	025	Now concerning virgins, I have no commandment of the Lord; but I offer my opinion, as having obtained mercy from the Lord to be faithful.
046	1CO	007	026	I think then that this is becoming, considering our present straits, that it is proper for a man to be thus.
046	1CO	007	027	Art thou bound to a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.
046	1CO	007	028	But if thou shouldst marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned; though such will have tribulation in the flesh; but I spare you.
046	1CO	007	029	Now this I say, brethren, that the time is short. The conclusion is, that even they who have wives, should be as though they had not;
046	1CO	007	030	and they who weep as though they wept not; and they who rejoice as though they rejoiced not; and they that purchase as though they possessed not;
046	1CO	007	031	and they who use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away.
046	1CO	007	032	But I would have you to be free from anxiety. He who is unmarried is anxious for the things of the Lord, how he shall please the Lord:
046	1CO	007	033	but he who is married is anxious about the things of the world, how he shall please his wife.
046	1CO	007	034	A wife and a virgin hath different pursuits: the unmarried woman is anxious about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and spirit; but the married woman is anxious about the things of the world, how she shall please her husband.
046	1CO	007	035	Now I say this for your own advantage, and not that I should lay a snare in your way, but as what is seemly, and that you may wait on the Lord without distraction.
046	1CO	007	036	But if a person supposes it would be unseemly for a virgin of his if she should pass the flower of her age in celibacy, and that duty directs it should be so, let him do as he is inclined, he doth not sin: let such marry.
046	1CO	007	037	But he that is stedfast in his heart, not having any necessity, but retaineth power over his own inclination, and hath determined this in his heart that he will preserve his own virgin state, doeth well.
046	1CO	007	038	Wherefore though he who giveth in marriage doeth well, yet he who avoids a matrimonial connection, doeth better.
046	1CO	007	039	The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth: but if her husband be dead, she is free to be married to whomsoever she will, but only in the Lord.
046	1CO	007	040	But she is more blessed if she abide as she is, in my opinion: and I think I have the spirit of God.
046	1CO	008	001	NOW concerning the things sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth.
046	1CO	008	002	But if any man conceit that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.
046	1CO	008	003	But if any man love God, the same is known of him.
046	1CO	008	004	Now concerning eating things sacrificed unto idols: we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God but one.
046	1CO	008	005	For though there are gods so called, whether celestial or terrestrial, (as of this sort there are gods many, and lords many; )
046	1CO	008	006	but to us there is one God, the Father; of whom are all things, and we for him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.
046	1CO	008	007	Howbeit there is not in all men this knowledge; but some having conscientious respect for the idol to this moment, eat the meat as sacrificed to the idol; and their conscience being weak, is defiled.
046	1CO	008	008	But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither if we eat are we the better, or if we eat not are we the worse.
046	1CO	008	009	But take heed that this power of yours become not an occasion of stumbling to the weak.
046	1CO	008	010	For if any man see thee that hast knowledge, sitting in an idol’s temple, shall not the conscience of him who is weak be emboldened to eat what is sacrificed to idols?
046	1CO	008	011	And the weak brother will be destroyed by thy knowledge, for whom Christ died.
046	1CO	008	012	But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.
046	1CO	008	013	Wherefore if meat give occasion of offence to my brother, I will in no wise eat meat for ever, that I give no cause of offence to my brother.
046	1CO	009	001	AM I not an apostle? am I not a free man? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?
046	1CO	009	002	If I am not an apostle unto others, doubtless I am to you: for ye are the seal of my apostolic mission in the Lord.
046	1CO	009	003	My apology to those who interrogate me is this,
046	1CO	009	004	Have we not power to eat and drink?
046	1CO	009	005	Have we not power to carry about with us a sister wife, as do also the other apostles, even the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?
046	1CO	009	006	or I alone and Barnabas, have we not power to forbear labour?
046	1CO	009	007	Who goeth at any time to war at his own expences? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit of it? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?
046	1CO	009	008	Speak I these things rationally as a man, or doth not the law speak the same things?
046	1CO	009	009	for in the law of Moses it is written, “Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox which treadeth out the corn.” Doth God take care for oxen?
046	1CO	009	010	or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes doubtless it was written; because he who ploweth ought to plow in hope, and he who soweth in hope should be partaker of his hope.
046	1CO	009	011	If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we should reap your corporal things?
046	1CO	009	012	if others partake of this power over you, ought not we much more? But we have not used this power, and we suffer all things, that we might not put any obstruction in the way of the gospel of Christ.
046	1CO	009	013	Know ye not that they who are employed about the holy things, are fed from the temple? and they who serve at the altar, partake with the altar?
046	1CO	009	014	So also the Lord hath commanded to those who preach the gospel, that they should live by the gospel.
046	1CO	009	015	But I have used nothing of these things, nor have I written indeed these things, that it should be so done respecting me; for it would become me to die rather than that any man should make my glorying void.
046	1CO	009	016	For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me, yea verily woe is to me if I preach not the gospel.
046	1CO	009	017	For if I do this willingly, I have a reward; but if unwillingly, I am entrusted with the dispensation of it.
046	1CO	009	018	What then is my reward? That when I preach the gospel, I may put the gospel of Christ to no expence, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.
046	1CO	009	019	For though I be free from all men, I have made myself the servant of all, that I might gain the more.
046	1CO	009	020	And I became to the Jews as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to those under the law, as under the law, that I might gain those who are under the law;
046	1CO	009	021	to those who are without law, as without law (not as being without law to God, but under the law to Christ), that I might gain those who were without law.
046	1CO	009	022	I became to the weak as weak, that I might gain the weak; I became all things to all men, that by every means I might save some.
046	1CO	009	023	And this I do for the gospel’s sake, that I may be a partaker of it with you.
046	1CO	009	024	Know ye not that they who run on the course, all run indeed, yet but one obtaineth the price? So run, that ye may obtain.
046	1CO	009	025	And every one who contendeth in the games is temperate in all things: they indeed therefore do it that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible.
046	1CO	009	026	I therefore so run not as uncertainly; so do I exercise with my fists, not as striking the air:
046	1CO	009	027	but I beat down my body, and bring it into subjection, that I may not by any means, after having preached to others, myself become reprobate.
046	1CO	010	001	BUT I would not that you should be ignorant, brethren, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;
046	1CO	010	002	and were all baptised unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;
046	1CO	010	003	and did all eat the same spiritual meat;
046	1CO	010	004	and did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual rock which followed them; but that rock was Christ.
046	1CO	010	005	Nevertheless with the most of them God was not well pleased, for they were destroyed in the wilderness.
046	1CO	010	006	Now these things were examples for us, that we might not be coveters of evil things, as they also coveted.
046	1CO	010	007	Neither be ye idolaters as some of them; as it is written, “The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to sport themselves.”
046	1CO	010	008	Neither let us commit whoredom, as some of them also committed, and in one day fell twenty-three thousand.
046	1CO	010	009	Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed by serpents.
046	1CO	010	010	Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and perished by the destroyer.
046	1CO	010	011	Now all these things happened unto them as examples, but they are written for our admonition, on whom the ends of the ages are come.
046	1CO	010	012	Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall.
046	1CO	010	013	No temptation hath overtaken you, but what is common to men. And God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted beyond what ye are able to bear; but will with the temptation make also a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear up under it.
046	1CO	010	014	Wherefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.
046	1CO	010	015	I speak as unto wise men: judge ye what I say.
046	1CO	010	016	The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?
046	1CO	010	017	For we, though many, are one loaf, one body; for we all partake of that one loaf.
046	1CO	010	018	Behold Israel after the flesh. Are not they who eat of the sacrifices partakers with the altar?
046	1CO	010	019	What do I say then? that an idol is any thing, or that which is sacrificed to an idol is any thing?
046	1CO	010	020	But that what the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to daemons, and not to God: and I would not have you in communion with daemons.
046	1CO	010	021	Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of daemons: ye cannot be partakers of the table of the Lord, and the table of daemons.
046	1CO	010	022	Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?
046	1CO	010	023	All things are lawful for me, but all things are not profitable; all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.
046	1CO	010	024	Let no man seek his own gratification, but every one another’s good.
046	1CO	010	025	Every thing which is sold in the shambles eat, asking no question for conscience sake;
046	1CO	010	026	“for the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof.”
046	1CO	010	027	And if any one of those, who do not believe, invite you, and ye incline to go, eat every thing set before you, asking no question for conscience sake.
046	1CO	010	028	But if any person say unto you, This is an idol’s sacrifice, eat not of it, for his sake who pointed it out, and for conscience sake. For the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof.
046	1CO	010	029	Conscience indeed I say, not merely thine own, but that of the other person.
046	1CO	010	030	For why is my liberty abridged by another’s conscience? If I truly with thanksgiving am a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?
046	1CO	010	031	Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all things to the glory of God.
046	1CO	010	032	Give no occasion of stumbling either to the Jews or the Gentiles, or the church of God:
046	1CO	010	033	even as I please all men, not seeking my own advantage, but that of the many, that they may be saved.
046	1CO	011	001	BE ye imitators of me, as I am of Christ.
046	1CO	011	002	Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and hold fast the injunctions as I delivered them unto you.
046	1CO	011	003	But I desire you to take notice that the head of every man is Christ; but the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God.
046	1CO	011	004	Every man praying or prophesying, holding a veil over his head, dishonoureth his head;
046	1CO	011	005	but every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled, dishonoureth her head; for it is one and the same thing, as if she were shaven.
046	1CO	011	006	For if the woman be not veiled, let her hair be clipped: but if it would be scandalous for a woman to appear clipped or shaved, let her be veiled.
046	1CO	011	007	For a man indeed ought not to veil his head, being the image and the glory of God; but the woman is the glory of the man.
046	1CO	011	008	For the man is not from the woman, but the woman from the man.
046	1CO	011	009	Also the man was not created for the woman, but the woman for the man.
046	1CO	011	010	Therefore ought the woman to retain upon her head this badge of authority, because of the angels of the churches.
046	1CO	011	011	Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, nor the woman without the man in the Lord.
046	1CO	011	012	For as the woman was taken out of the man, so also is the man by the woman: but all things are of God.
046	1CO	011	013	Judge among yourselves, is it decent for a woman to be praying to God without a covering?
046	1CO	011	014	Does not even nature itself teach you, that if a man wear long flowing hair it is a dishonour to him?
046	1CO	011	015	But if a woman let her hair flow, it is an ornament to her; for the hair was given her for a covering,
046	1CO	011	016	But if any man mean to be contentious about it, we have no such custom, nor the churches of God.
046	1CO	011	017	But in the matter I am going to denounce, I do not commend you, that ye meet together not for the better, but for the worse.
046	1CO	011	018	For in the first place, when ye assemble in the church, I hear that there are divisions among you; and I partly believe it.
046	1CO	011	019	For there must be heresies among you, that they who are the tried ones, may be made manifest among you.
046	1CO	011	020	When therefore ye assemble in the same place, it is not to eat the Lord’s supper.
046	1CO	011	021	For one in the eating it taketh before another his own supper: and one is hungry, and another drinks to excess.
046	1CO	011	022	What! have ye not houses to eat in and to drink? or despise ye the church of God, and make those ashamed who have none? What shall I say unto you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.
046	1CO	011	023	For I received of the Lord what also I delivered to you, That the Lord Jesus, in the night in which he was betrayed, took a loaf:
046	1CO	011	024	and when he had blessed it, he brake it, and said, Take, eat; this is my body, which is broken for you: do this in remembrance of me.
046	1CO	011	025	In like manner also he took the cup, after they had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do, as often as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.
046	1CO	011	026	For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew forth the death of the Lord till he come.
046	1CO	011	027	Wherefore, whosoever eateth of this bread, or drinketh the cup of the Lord unworthily, he is guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.
046	1CO	011	028	But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.
046	1CO	011	029	For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh condemnation to himself, not distinguishing the Lord’s body.
046	1CO	011	030	For this cause many are diseased and infirm among you, and some asleep in death.
046	1CO	011	031	For if we thoroughly judged ourselves, we should not be judged of the Lord.
046	1CO	011	032	But being judged, we are corrected by the Lord, that we might not be condemned with the world.
046	1CO	011	033	Wherefore, when ye meet together to eat the Lord’s supper, wait for one another.
046	1CO	011	034	And if any man be hungry, let him eat at home; that ye meet not together for condemnation. And the other matters I will regulate when I come.
046	1CO	012	001	NOW concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.
046	1CO	012	002	Ye know that ye were Gentiles, drawn away after the idols that are dumb, even as ye have been led.
046	1CO	012	003	Wherefore I advertise you, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God, call Jesus anathema: and no man can say, Lord Jesus, but by the Holy Ghost.
046	1CO	012	004	But there are diversities of gifts, though the same Spirit.
046	1CO	012	005	And there are diversities of services, but the same Lord.
046	1CO	012	006	And there are diversities of mighty operations, but it is the same God who worketh all in all.
046	1CO	012	007	Now to every one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for usefulness.
046	1CO	012	008	For to one man by the Spirit is given wise discourse; but to another speech communicative of knowledge by the same Spirit;
046	1CO	012	009	to another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing diseases by the same Spirit;
046	1CO	012	010	to another miraculous powers; to another prophecy; to another discernments of spirits; to another different kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:
046	1CO	012	011	but all these things worketh that one and the same Spirit, distributing peculiar gifts to every one even as he wills.
046	1CO	012	012	For as the body is one, and hath many members, but all the members of that one body, though many, are one body: so also is Christ.
046	1CO	012	013	For by one Spirit we all have been baptised into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free men; and we have all been made to drink into one Spirit.
046	1CO	012	014	For the body is not one member, but many.
046	1CO	012	015	If the foot should say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it, on this account, not of the body?
046	1CO	012	016	And if the ear should say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it not therefore of the body?
046	1CO	012	017	If the whole body were eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?
046	1CO	012	018	But now hath God placed the members, every one of them in the body, as he hath chosen.
046	1CO	012	019	But if the whole were one member, where were the body?
046	1CO	012	020	But now the members indeed are many, but the body one.
046	1CO	012	021	Nor can the eye say to the hand, I have no need of thee: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.
046	1CO	012	022	Yea, much more the members of the body, which appear to be more feeble, are necessary:
046	1CO	012	023	and those parts which we esteem as the more dishonourable of the body, on them we bestow more abundant honour, and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.
046	1CO	012	024	For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered together the body, giving more abundant honour to that part which lacked:
046	1CO	012	025	that there might be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.
046	1CO	012	026	And if one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; and if one member be exalted, all the members rejoice with it.
046	1CO	012	027	Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.
046	1CO	012	028	And these also hath God placed in the church, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, next miracles, then gifts of healings, helpers, directors, different kinds of tongues.
046	1CO	012	029	Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?
046	1CO	012	030	have all gifts of healings? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?
046	1CO	012	031	But zealously seek the gifts that are the best: and yet I shew unto you a more transcendently excellent way.
046	1CO	013	001	THOUGH I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am become as sounding brass, and tinkling cymbal.
046	1CO	013	002	And though I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries, and all manner of science; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.
046	1CO	013	003	And if I deal out all my goods in alms, and deliver up my body that I should be burned, but have not love, I am nothing advantaged by it.
046	1CO	013	004	Love is long-suffering, is kind; love envieth not; love is no vain boaster, is not inflated with pride,
046	1CO	013	005	doth not act unseemly, seeketh not her own advantage, is not passionate, thinketh no evil;
046	1CO	013	006	rejoiceth not in unrighteousness, but rejoiceth in the truth;
046	1CO	013	007	beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.
046	1CO	013	008	Love never faileth: but if there be prophetic gifts, they shall be no more; if tongues, they shall cease; if science, it shall vanish away.
046	1CO	013	009	For we know partially, and prophesy partially.
046	1CO	013	010	But when that which is perfect cometh, then that which is in part shall be done away.
046	1CO	013	011	When I was a child, I spake as a child, I thought as a child, I reasoned as a child: but when I grew a man, I put away childish things.
046	1CO	013	012	For now we see by reflected light, indistinctly; but then face to face: now I know partially; but then shall I know even as I am known.
046	1CO	013	013	But now abideth faith, hope, love, these three; but the greater of these is love.
046	1CO	014	001	FOLLOW earnestly after love, and zealously seek spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.
046	1CO	014	002	For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue, speaketh not to men, but to God: for no man understandeth him; although in spirit he speaketh mysterious truths.
046	1CO	014	003	But he that prophesieth, addresseth men for edification, and exhortation, and consolation.
046	1CO	014	004	He that speaketh in an unknown tongue, edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth, edifieth the church.
046	1CO	014	005	Now I could wish that you all spake with tongues, but rather that ye should prophesy: for greater is he that prophesieth, than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret also, that the church may receive edification.
046	1CO	014	006	Now I, brethren, if I should come unto you, speaking in unknown languages, what should I profit you, unless I should speak to you intelligibly by revelation, or by science, or by prophecy, or by doctrine?
046	1CO	014	007	In like manner things inanimate, giving sound, whether the pipe, or the harp, unless they express a distinction in their tones, how shall it be known what is piped, or what is harped?
046	1CO	014	008	For if the trumpet also give an uncertain sound, who will prepare himself for the battle?
046	1CO	014	009	So also ye, unless with the tongue you speak an intelligible discourse, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye will speak to the air.
046	1CO	014	010	For though there are so many different kinds of languages in the world, yet is not one of them without its meaning.
046	1CO	014	011	If therefore I know not the force of the expression, I shall be to him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh will be a barbarian unto me.
046	1CO	014	012	So also ye, if ye zealously affect spiritual gifts, seek that ye may abound in them for the edification of the church.
046	1CO	014	013	Therefore let him who speaketh in an unknown tongue, pray that he may interpret also.
046	1CO	014	014	For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my mind produces no fruit.
046	1CO	014	015	What then is my object? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing psalms with the spirit, and I will sing psalms with the understanding also.
046	1CO	014	016	Else, though thou bless God in spirit, how shall he who filleth the place of an illiterate man, say Amen after thy thanksgiving, seeing he knoweth not what thou sayest?
046	1CO	014	017	For thou indeed givest thanks to God well, but another man is not edified by it.
046	1CO	014	018	I thank my God, that I speak with different tongues more than you all:
046	1CO	014	019	but in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I may instruct others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.
046	1CO	014	020	Brethren, be not children in your minds: though in naughtiness be ye children, but in your minds be men complete.
046	1CO	014	021	In the law it is written, “That with other tongues, and with other lips, will I speak to this people: and even thus will they not attend to me, saith the Lord.”
046	1CO	014	022	Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to those that believe, but to those who do not believe: but the gift of prophecy is not for those who are infidels, but for believers.
046	1CO	014	023	If then the whole church assemble together in the same place, and all speak different tongues, and there come in illiterate persons, or infidels, will they not say ye are mad?
046	1CO	014	024	But if all prophesy, and any infidel or illiterate person come in, he receives conviction from all, he is judged of all:
046	1CO	014	025	and thus the secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so falling down on his face, he will worship God, declaring that God verily is among you.
046	1CO	014	026	How comes it then, brethren, that when ye assemble together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation? Let all things be done to edification.
046	1CO	014	027	If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at most by three, and one after another; and let one interpret.
046	1CO	014	028	But if there be not an interpreter, let him be silent in the church; but let him speak to himself and to God.
046	1CO	014	029	Let the prophets two or three speak, and let the others judge.
046	1CO	014	030	But if any thing should be revealed to one sitting by, let the first be silent.
046	1CO	014	031	For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all be comforted.
046	1CO	014	032	And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.
046	1CO	014	033	For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all the churches of his saints.
046	1CO	014	034	Let your women be silent in the churches: for it is not permitted to them to speak: but to be in subjection, as also the law saith.
046	1CO	014	035	But if they will learn any thing, let them ask their own husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.
046	1CO	014	036	Went the word of God from you? or came it unto you only?
046	1CO	014	037	If any man thinketh that he is a prophet, or spiritually gifted, let him acknowledge that the things which I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.
046	1CO	014	038	But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.
046	1CO	014	039	Wherefore, my brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.
046	1CO	014	040	Let all things be done with propriety, and orderly.
046	1CO	015	001	NOW I make known unto you, brethren, the gospel which I have preached unto you, and which ye have received, in which also ye have stood fast;
046	1CO	015	002	by which also ye are saved; if ye cleave to that word I have preached to you, except haply ye have believed in vain.
046	1CO	015	003	For I delivered to you among the first things that which I also had received, that Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures;
046	1CO	015	004	and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
046	1CO	015	005	and that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:
046	1CO	015	006	afterwards he appeared before five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater number remain alive unto this hour, but some also are gone to rest.
046	1CO	015	007	Afterwards he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.
046	1CO	015	008	And last of all he was seen also by me, who am but as an abortion.
046	1CO	015	009	For I am the least of the apostles, who am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
046	1CO	015	010	But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was given to me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.
046	1CO	015	011	Therefore whether I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.
046	1CO	015	012	But if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you, that there is no resurrection of the dead?
046	1CO	015	013	But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither is Christ risen:
046	1CO	015	014	and if Christ be not risen, vain indeed is our preaching, and vain also your faith.
046	1CO	015	015	Yea, and we also are found false witnesses for God; because we have testified on the behalf of God, that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if indeed the dead are not raised.
046	1CO	015	016	For if the dead are not raised, neither is Christ risen:
046	1CO	015	017	and if Christ be not risen, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.
046	1CO	015	018	Then also they who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
046	1CO	015	019	If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are more miserable than all other men.
046	1CO	015	020	But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first-fruit of those who have fallen asleep.
046	1CO	015	021	For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.
046	1CO	015	022	For as in Adam all are dead, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.
046	1CO	015	023	But every one in his own rank: Christ the first-fruit; afterwards those that are Christ’s at his appearing.
046	1CO	015	024	Then cometh the end, when he shall deliver up the kingdom to God, and the Father; when he shall have destroyed every dominion and every authority and power.
046	1CO	015	025	For he must reign, until he hath put all enemies under his feet.
046	1CO	015	026	The last enemy shall be destroyed, death.
046	1CO	015	027	For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith, that all things are put under him, it is evident that there is an exception of him, who subjected all things to him.
046	1CO	015	028	But when he shall have put all things under him, then also the Son himself shall be subjected to him who put all things under him, that God may be all in all.
046	1CO	015	029	Else what will they do who are baptised? for the dead, if wholly dead they rise no more. Why are they then baptised for the dead?
046	1CO	015	030	and why do we also expose ourselves to danger every hour?
046	1CO	015	031	I solemnly declare by all the joy over you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.
046	1CO	015	032	If after the manner of men I have fought with wild beasts at Ephesus, of what advantage would it be to me, if the dead did not rise again? shall we eat and drink; because to-morrow we die?
046	1CO	015	033	Be not deceived: evil conversations corrupt good manners.
046	1CO	015	034	Awake as the righteous, and sin not; for some have an ignorance of God: I speak this to your shame.
046	1CO	015	035	But will any man say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?
046	1CO	015	036	Thou fool! what thou sowest is not quickened except it die:
046	1CO	015	037	and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body which shall be afterwards, but the bare grain, perhaps of wheat, or of some of the other seeds:
046	1CO	015	038	but God giveth it a body as he pleaseth, and to each of the seeds its peculiar body.
046	1CO	015	039	All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, and another flesh of cattle, and another of fishes, and another of birds.
046	1CO	015	040	Also there are celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and that of the terrestrial another.
046	1CO	015	041	There is one glory of the sun; and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for star differeth from star in glory.
046	1CO	015	042	So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:
046	1CO	015	043	it is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:
046	1CO	015	044	it is sown an animal body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is an animal body, and there is a spiritual body.
046	1CO	015	045	And so it is written, There was a first man Adam a living soul; a last Adam a quickening spirit.
046	1CO	015	046	But that which is spiritual was not first, but that which is animal; and afterward that which is spiritual.
046	1CO	015	047	The first man was of the earth, earthly; the second man was the Lord from heaven.
046	1CO	015	048	As is the earthly, so are they also that are earthly: and as is the heavenly, such also are they that are heavenly.
046	1CO	015	049	And as we have borne the image of the earthly, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.
046	1CO	015	050	But this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God: neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.
046	1CO	015	051	Behold, I shew you a mystery; we shall not indeed all sleep, but we shall all be changed,
046	1CO	015	052	in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
046	1CO	015	053	For that which is corruptible must put on incorruption, and that which is mortal must put on immortality.
046	1CO	015	054	So when that which is corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and that which is mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying which is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.
046	1CO	015	055	O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?
046	1CO	015	056	The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.
046	1CO	015	057	But thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
046	1CO	015	058	Wherefore, my beloved brethren, be stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.
046	1CO	016	001	NOW concerning the collection which is for the saints, as I have given an order to the churches of Galatia, so also do ye.
046	1CO	016	002	On the first day of the week let every one of you set apart with himself, treasuring it up, whatsoever he may please to give, that when I come there may be then no gatherings.
046	1CO	016	003	But when I come, whosoever you shall approve by letters, those will I send to carry your charity to Jerusalem.
046	1CO	016	004	But if it be of importance that I should go also, they shall go with me.
046	1CO	016	005	Now I will come unto you when I have passed through Macedonia (for I am passing through Macedonia);
046	1CO	016	006	and perhaps I shall abide with you, yea and winter with you, that you may send me forward whithersoever I go.
046	1CO	016	007	For I will not see you now in passing, but I hope to remain some considerable time with you if the Lord permit.
046	1CO	016	008	But I shall abide at Ephesus until the Pentecost:
046	1CO	016	009	for there is opened to me a great door, and effectual, and there are many adversaries.
046	1CO	016	010	But if Timothy come, see that he may be among you without fear: for he worketh the Lord’s work, as I also do.
046	1CO	016	011	Let no man therefore treat him with disrespect; but forward him on his way in peace, that he may come to me; for I expect him with the brethren.
046	1CO	016	012	As concerning brother Apollos, I besought him much that he would come to you with the brethren; but it was not at all his wish to come at this time: but he will come when he can find a good opportunity.
046	1CO	016	013	Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, be manful, be strong.
046	1CO	016	014	Let all your concerns be transacted in love.
046	1CO	016	015	Now I exhort you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the ministry of the saints: )
046	1CO	016	016	wherefore submit yourselves to such, and to every one that worketh with us and laboureth.
046	1CO	016	017	I rejoice in the arrival of Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaicus; because what was lacking from you, they have supplied.
046	1CO	016	018	For they have refreshed my spirit and yours; respect therefore such men.
046	1CO	016	019	The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church which is in their house.
046	1CO	016	020	All the brethren salute you. Salute one another with a holy kiss.
046	1CO	016	021	The salutation of Paul with mine own hand.
046	1CO	016	022	If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema, Maranatha.
046	1CO	016	023	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
046	1CO	016	024	My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen. The first epistle to the Corinthians was written from Philippi by Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaicus, and Timothy.

# BOOK	047	2CO	2 Corinthians	2 Corinthians
047	2CO	001	001	PAUL an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy a brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:
047	2CO	001	002	grace unto you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
047	2CO	001	003	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and God of all consolation;
047	2CO	001	004	who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we might be able to comfort those who are in all tribulation, by the consolation with which we ourselves are comforted of God.
047	2CO	001	005	Because as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so through Christ aboundeth also our consolation.
047	2CO	001	006	But whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectually wrought by patient endurance of the same sufferings which we also suffer; or if we are comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.
047	2CO	001	007	And our hope of you is sure, knowing that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so also of the consolation.
047	2CO	001	008	For we would not have you ignorant, brethren, of the tribulation which came to us in Asia, that above measure we have been burdened beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of life:
047	2CO	001	009	for we ourselves, in ourselves have received the sentence of death, that we should have no confidence in ourselves, but in God who raiseth the dead.
047	2CO	001	010	Who from so imminent a prospect of death hath delivered us, and still delivers: in whom we trust also that he will yet deliver us:
047	2CO	001	011	ye also labouring together for us in prayer, that from many persons thanks may be given on our behalf for the gifts bestowed on us by many.
047	2CO	001	012	For our glorying is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with carnal wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and peculiarly towards you.
047	2CO	001	013	For we write no other things to you than those which you know and acknowledge; and I trust also ye will acknowledge them even to the end.
047	2CO	001	014	As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your glory, as also ye are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.
047	2CO	001	015	And in this confidence I was intending to come unto you a second time, that ye might receive a second blessing;
047	2CO	001	016	and through you to pass into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia return unto you, and by you to be forwarded on my journey towards Judea.
047	2CO	001	017	Such then being my intention, did I indeed change it with levity? or the things which I purpose, do I purpose after the flesh, that with me there should be yea, yea, and nay, nay?
047	2CO	001	018	But as sure as God is true, our word to you was not yea and nay.
047	2CO	001	019	For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us―by me and Silvanus and Timotheus―was not yea and nay, but there was yea in him;
047	2CO	001	020	for all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, to the glory of God by us.
047	2CO	001	021	Now he that confirmeth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God;
047	2CO	001	022	who also hath put his seal upon us, and given us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.
047	2CO	001	023	But I appeal to God as a witness unto my soul, that to spare you I have not yet come to Corinth:
047	2CO	001	024	not that we have dominion over your faith, but are fellow-helpers of your joy; for by faith ye stand.
047	2CO	002	001	BUT I prescribed to myself this rule, not to come again to you with sorrow.
047	2CO	002	002	For if I make you sorry, who is he that maketh me glad, but he that is made sorrowful by me?
047	2CO	002	003	And I have written unto you for this very purpose, that I might not, when I come to you, have sorrow from those in whom I ought to rejoice, having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.
047	2CO	002	004	For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears, not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly towards you.
047	2CO	002	005	Now if any person hath given cause for grief, he hath not grieved me merely, but partly all of you; that I may add no farther burden.
047	2CO	002	006	Sufficient for such person is that chastisement which hath been inflicted by the majority of you.
047	2CO	002	007	Wherefore, on the contrary, ye rather ought to forgive and comfort him, lest such a one be swallowed up with excess of sorrow.
047	2CO	002	008	Wherefore I exhort you to confirm your love towards him.
047	2CO	002	009	For to this end also have I written, that I may know by this proof of you if ye are obedient in all things.
047	2CO	002	010	But to whomsoever ye forgive any thing, so do I; and if I forgive any thing, to whom I forgive, for your sakes I do it, in the person of Jesus Christ,
047	2CO	002	011	that no advantage be gained over us by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his devices.
047	2CO	002	012	But when I came to Troas to preach the Gospel of Christ, though a door was opened unto me by the Lord,
047	2CO	002	013	I had no test in my spirit on my not finding there Titus my brother: so taking my leave of them I went forth unto Macedonia.
047	2CO	002	014	But thanks be to God, who causeth us always to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.
047	2CO	002	015	For we are a sweet odour of Christ to God in those who are saved, and in those who perish.
047	2CO	002	016	To the one we are the odour of death unto death, to the other the odour of life unto life: and who is sufficient for these things?
047	2CO	002	017	For we are not as the many, adulterating the word of God; but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, speak we in Christ.
047	2CO	003	001	DO we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some, commendatory letters to you, or commendatory letters from you?
047	2CO	003	002	Ye are our letter written in our hearts, acknowledged and read of all men:
047	2CO	003	003	because ye are manifestly seen to be the letter of Christ, of which we have been the secretaries, written not with ink, but by the Spirit of the living God, not on tables of stone, but on the fleshly tables of the heart.
047	2CO	003	004	And such confidence have we through Christ towards God:
047	2CO	003	005	not that we are sufficient of ourselves to account any thing of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God.
047	2CO	003	006	Who hath made us also able ministers of the new testament, not of the letter but of the spirit; for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.
047	2CO	003	007	For if the ministry of death in letters graven on stone, was attended with glory, so that the children of Israel could not keep their eyes fixed upon the countenance of Moses, because of the glory of his countenance, though soon evanescent;
047	2CO	003	008	how much more will not the ministry of the Spirit be attended with glory?
047	2CO	003	009	For if the ministry of condemnation is glory, much more doth the ministry of righteousness excel in glory.
047	2CO	003	010	For that which was glorious hath no glory, comparatively, because of the glory which excelleth.
047	2CO	003	011	For if that which was abolished came in a glorious manner, much more is that which remaineth glorious.
047	2CO	003	012	Having therefore such a hope, we use much freedom of speech.
047	2CO	003	013	And act not as Moses who spread a veil over his face, in order that the children of Israel might not look stedfastly to the end of that which should be abolished.
047	2CO	003	014	But their understandings were darkened: for unto this day the same veil in their reading the old testament abideth unremoved; which veil is taken away by Christ.
047	2CO	003	015	For unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil is spread over their hearts.
047	2CO	003	016	Nevertheless, when Israel shall turn unto the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.
047	2CO	003	017	Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.
047	2CO	003	018	And we all with face unveiled, beholding the glory of the Lord reflected as in a mirror, according to the same image, receive a transformation from glory into glory, as by the Lord, the Spirit.
047	2CO	004	001	THEREFORE having this ministry, as we have obtained mercy, we faint not;
047	2CO	004	002	but have renounced all shameful secret practices, not conducting ourselves with artifice, nor deceitfully disguising the word of God, but by clear manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves to every man’s conscience as in the presence of God.
047	2CO	004	003	And if now our gospel be hid, it is hid from those who are lost:
047	2CO	004	004	among whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of the unbelievers, that the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not dart its bright beams upon them.
047	2CO	004	005	For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus’ sake.
047	2CO	004	006	For the God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, he hath shined into our hearts, to give illumination of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
047	2CO	004	007	But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the transcendent excellence of the power might be of God, and not of us.
047	2CO	004	008	We are afflicted on every side, yet not reduced to extremities; under difficulties, yet not in despair;
047	2CO	004	009	persecuted, yet not abandoned; cast down, but not destroyed;
047	2CO	004	010	always bearing about in the body the death pangs of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our body.
047	2CO	004	011	For we who are yet alive are continually delivered up to death for Jesus’ sake, that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our mortal flesh.
047	2CO	004	012	Wherefore death indeed is working in us, but life in you.
047	2CO	004	013	Having then the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore I have spoken, we also believe, and therefore speak;
047	2CO	004	014	knowing that he who raised up our Lord Jesus Christ, will raise up us also through Jesus, and present us together with you.
047	2CO	004	015	For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace, through the thanksgiving of more persons, may more abound to the glory of God.
047	2CO	004	016	Therefore we never faint; for though our outward man decay, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.
047	2CO	004	017	For our momentary light affliction worketh for us a transcendently far more exceeding eternal weight of glory;
047	2CO	004	018	whilst we direct our aim not to the things which are seen, but to the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporary, but the things that are not seen are eternal.
047	2CO	005	001	FOR we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle should be taken down, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
047	2CO	005	002	For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed with our mansion which is from heaven;
047	2CO	005	003	that so invested, we may not be found naked.
047	2CO	005	004	For we which are in this tabernacle, groan, being burdened; wherein we desire not to be unclothed, but clothed upon, that what is mortal may be swallowed up of life.
047	2CO	005	005	But he that hath wrought us for this very thing is God, who also hath given us the earnest of the spirit.
047	2CO	005	006	Therefore we have always confidence, and know that whilst we are indwelling in the body, we are absent from the Lord:
047	2CO	005	007	(for we walk by faith, not by sight.)
047	2CO	005	008	We are confident indeed, and with pleasure expect to go out from the body, and to dwell within with the Lord:
047	2CO	005	009	wherefore also our ambition is, that whether dwelling in the body, or out of the body, we may be acceptable to him.
047	2CO	005	010	For we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, that each may receive the things done in the body according to what he hath done, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.
047	2CO	005	011	Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we have been made manifest to God, and I hope also have been made manifest in your consciences.
047	2CO	005	012	For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion of glorying on our behalf, that ye may have an answer for those who glory in countenance, and not in heart.
047	2CO	005	013	For if we are transported out of ourselves, it is for God; or if we are sober-minded, it is for your sake.
047	2CO	005	014	For the love of Christ constraineth us, because we judge thus, that if one died for all, then were all dead:
047	2CO	005	015	and he died for all, that they who live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him that died for them, and rose again.
047	2CO	005	016	Wherefore from the present moment know we no man after the flesh: yea though we have also known Christ after the flesh, yet so henceforth know we him no more.
047	2CO	005	017	Wherefore if any person be in Christ, he is a new creation: the old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.
047	2CO	005	018	But all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;
047	2CO	005	019	namely, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing to them their offences: and hath committed to us the word of reconciliation.
047	2CO	005	020	Therefore we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God exhorted you by us; we entreat you for Christ’s sake, be ye reconciled to God.
047	2CO	005	021	For he hath made him, who knew no sin, to be a sin offering for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in him.
047	2CO	006	001	WE then as labourers with him, exhort you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain:
047	2CO	006	002	for he saith, “In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I succoured thee.” Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.
047	2CO	006	003	Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:
047	2CO	006	004	but in every thing approving ourselves as ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in straits,
047	2CO	006	005	in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings,
047	2CO	006	006	in purity, in knowledge, in long-suffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,
047	2CO	006	007	by the word of truth, by the power of God, with weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left,
047	2CO	006	008	through honour and dishonour, through evil report and good report: as deceivers, yet true men;
047	2CO	006	009	as unknown, though well known; as dying, and lo! we live; as chastened, yet not given over to death;
047	2CO	006	010	as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.
047	2CO	006	011	Our mouth is opened unto you, O Corinthians! our heart is enlarged.
047	2CO	006	012	Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels.
047	2CO	006	013	Let us have a like return; I speak as unto children; be ye also enlarged.
047	2CO	006	014	Be not unequally yoked with infidels; for what participation hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what fellowship is there between light and darkness?
047	2CO	006	015	and what concord of Christ with Belial? or what share hath he that believeth with an infidel?
047	2CO	006	016	or what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, “I will inhabit in them, and walk about in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be for me a people.”
047	2CO	006	017	“Wherefore go forth from the midst of them, and be ye separated, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean; and I will receive you,
047	2CO	006	018	and I will be as a father unto you, and ye shall be to me for sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.”
047	2CO	007	001	HAVING therefore these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
047	2CO	007	002	Give us a favourable reception: we have injured no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.
047	2CO	007	003	I speak not for your condemnation, for I have already said, that ye are in our hearts to die and live together.
047	2CO	007	004	Great is my freedom of speech to you, great is my glorying over you: I am filled with consolation, I overflow with joy in all our tribulation.
047	2CO	007	005	For when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were afflicted on every side; without were fightings; within were fears.
047	2CO	007	006	But God that comforteth the lowly comforted us by the coming of Titus:
047	2CO	007	007	and not by his coming only, but also by the consolation wherewith he had been comforted among you, declaring to us your fervent desire, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced the more.
047	2CO	007	008	For if I grieved you by a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that this letter made you sorry, though but for a season.
047	2CO	007	009	Now I rejoice, not that ye have been made sorrowful, but that ye have sorrowed unto repentance; for ye have been made sorry in a godly manner, that ye might receive damage from us in nothing.
047	2CO	007	010	For sorrow of a godly sort worketh repentance unto salvation never to be repented of, but worldly sorrow worketh death.
047	2CO	007	011	For behold this very thing, that ye were made sorry after a godly manner, how great diligence did it produce in you! yea, what apologizing! yea, what indignation! yea, what fear! yea, what earnest desire! yea, what zeal! yea, what vengeance! In every step ye have approved yourselves as pure in this affair.
047	2CO	007	012	And indeed though I wrote unto you, I did it not merely for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause who had suffered the injury, but that our diligent attention for you might be more abundantly manifested to you in the presence of God.
047	2CO	007	013	Therefore we were comforted in your consolation; and exceeding abundantly the more rejoiced we in the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.
047	2CO	007	014	For if I have boasted of you to him in any thing, I am not ashamed; but as we have spoken all things to you in truth, so our boasting of you to Titus hath been found truth.
047	2CO	007	015	And his bowels more abundantly yearn over you, when he remembers the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.
047	2CO	007	016	I rejoice therefore that in every thing I have confidence in you.
047	2CO	008	001	NOW we inform you, brethren, of the grace of God which hath been bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;
047	2CO	008	002	that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy, and their deep poverty, hath more abounded to the riches of their liberality.
047	2CO	008	003	For unto their power, I bear them witness, and above their power, they were voluntarily ready to give:
047	2CO	008	004	with much entreaty praying us that we would receive the gift, and undertake the communication of the contribution for the saints.
047	2CO	008	005	And not merely as we hoped, but gave themselves first to the Lord, and to us according to the will of God.
047	2CO	008	006	So that we exhorted Titus, that as he had been active before, so also he would perfect in you this grace also.
047	2CO	008	007	So as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and elocution, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also.
047	2CO	008	008	I speak not by commandment, but because of the forwardness of others, and to prove the genuineness of your love.
047	2CO	008	009	For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that for your sake he became poor though he was rich, that ye by his poverty should be made rich.
047	2CO	008	010	And in this I give my opinion: for this is expedient for you, who have before begun not only to do, but also to be willing a year ago.
047	2CO	008	011	Now then accomplish also the doing it, that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be also to perform out of that which ye have.
047	2CO	008	012	For if there is first a ready mind, a man is acceptable according to what he hath, and not according to what he hath not.
047	2CO	008	013	For I mean not that there should be ease for others and a burden on you;
047	2CO	008	014	but that according to equality, your abundance on the present occasion should afford a supply for their deficiency, that their abundance also may supply your deficiency, that there may be equality.
047	2CO	008	015	According as it is written, “He that gathered much had no more than others, and he who gathered little, had no less.”
047	2CO	008	016	But thanks be to God, who put the same solicitude for you into the heart of Titus.
047	2CO	008	017	For he received in deed the exhortation, but being more diligent, of his own ready mind he went unto you.
047	2CO	008	018	We have sent with him also a brother, whose praise in the gospel is spread through all the churches;
047	2CO	008	019	and not only so, but who was chosen by the churches as my fellow-traveller with this charity, ministered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and to shew your ready mind.
047	2CO	008	020	Avoiding this, that no man should lay any blame to us in this abundance which is administered by us:
047	2CO	008	021	providing what is fair, not only before the Lord, but also before men.
047	2CO	008	022	And we have sent with him our brother, whom we have often experienced in many things to be a man of diligence, but now much more diligent, through the great confidence which I have in you.
047	2CO	008	023	If any inquire concerning Titus, he is my companion and fellow-labourer to you; or our brethren be inquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ.
047	2CO	008	024	Therefore shew unto them, and in the presence of the churches, a proof of your love, and of our just boasting in you.
047	2CO	009	001	NOW concerning the contribution for the saints, it is superfluous for me to write unto you.
047	2CO	009	002	For I know your readiness of mind, for which I boast of you to the Macedonians, that Achaia had made preparation a year ago; and your zeal hath stirred up very many.
047	2CO	009	003	But I have sent the brethren, that our glorying in you might not be vain in this matter; that as I have said, ye may be prepared.
047	2CO	009	004	Lest haply if the Macedonians come with me, and find you unprepared, we (not to say, you) may be confounded in this confidence of boasting. I
047	2CO	009	005	have thought it necessary therefore to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and prepare before your promised bounty, that it may be ready as a matter of bounty, and not as extorted of covetousness.
047	2CO	009	006	But this I add, He that soweth sparingly, shall reap also sparingly, and he that soweth bountifully, shall reap also bountifully.
047	2CO	009	007	Let every man, as he hath purposed in heart, give, not with reluctance or of necessity; for God loveth a cheerful giver.
047	2CO	009	008	And God is able to make all grace abound towards you; that in every case having always all sufficiency, ye may abound unto every good work:
047	2CO	009	009	as it is written, “He hath scattered abroad, he hath given to the poor, his righteousness abideth for ever.”
047	2CO	009	010	Now he that supplieth seed to the sower, shall also supply bread for food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness,
047	2CO	009	011	being in every thing enriched unto all liberality, which causeth by us thanksgiving to God.
047	2CO	009	012	For the ministration of this charitable service not only abundantly supplies the deficiencies of the saints, but also overflows with many thanksgivings to God;
047	2CO	009	013	(while by the evidence of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection to the gospel of Christ, and for your liberality towards them, and towards all men; )
047	2CO	009	014	and with their prayers for you, greatly longing after you, on account of the transcendent grace of God in you.
047	2CO	009	015	Thanks be to God for his inexpressible gift.
047	2CO	010	001	NOW I Paul myself exhort you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who, when present, am indeed lowly among you, but being absent, am bold towards you.
047	2CO	010	002	But I pray, that when I am present I may not be bold with the confidence with which I purpose to act resolutely against some who think of us, as if we walked after the flesh.
047	2CO	010	003	For though we walk in the flesh, we war not after the flesh:
047	2CO	010	004	for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God for the casting down the strong holds of corruption;
047	2CO	010	005	laying low proud reasonings, and every high thing which exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and making every thought captive to the obedience of Christ:
047	2CO	010	006	and holding ourselves ready to avenge every act of disobedience, when your obedience is fully proved.
047	2CO	010	007	Regard ye the things that are personal? If any man is confident in himself that he is Christ’s, let him reflect again in himself, that as he is Christ’s, so are we Christ’s.
047	2CO	010	008	Yea, and if I should boast somewhat more highly of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for your edification, and not for your destruction, I shall not be ashamed;
047	2CO	010	009	that I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.
047	2CO	010	010	For his letters indeed, say they, are weighty and forcible, but his bodily presence is feeble, and his speech contemptible.
047	2CO	010	011	Let such a man be assured of this, that such as we are by word in our letters when absent, such also will we be in deed when we are present.
047	2CO	010	012	For we will not presume to put ourselves on the level, or compare ourselves with some who vaunt themselves; but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, have no understanding.
047	2CO	010	013	But we will not glory in things beyond our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath marked out for us―a measure that hath reached even unto you.
047	2CO	010	014	For we stretch not our pretensions beyond bounds, as though we reached not unto you; for we have advanced even unto you in the gospel of Christ:
047	2CO	010	015	not boasting ourselves unmeasurably in other men’s labours; but having hope that when your faith is increased, we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule for more abundant usefulness,
047	2CO	010	016	to preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to arrogate glory in another man’s line for things already prepared.
047	2CO	010	017	But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
047	2CO	010	018	For not he who commendeth himself is approved, but he whom the Lord commendeth.
047	2CO	011	001	I WISH ye would bear with me a little in my foolishness, yea indeed bear with me.
047	2CO	011	002	For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy; for I have espoused you to one husband, to present you a chaste virgin to Christ.
047	2CO	011	003	But I fear lest as the serpent beguiled Eve by his craftiness, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity which belongs to Christ.
047	2CO	011	004	For if he indeed that cometh preach another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not embraced, ye might well bear with him.
047	2CO	011	005	For I reckon myself to be nothing inferior to the very chief of the apostles.
047	2CO	011	006	For though I may be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but on every occasion we have been made manifest in all things among you.
047	2CO	011	007	Am I chargeable with a fault (humbling myself that you might be exalted), that I preached to you the gospel of God freely?
047	2CO	011	008	I plundered other churches, receiving a provision from them, in order to minister to you.
047	2CO	011	009	And when I was with you, and in want, I was burdensome to no man; for my want the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied; and on every occasion I have kept myself from being burdensome, and will keep myself.
047	2CO	011	010	I protest, by the truth of Christ in me, that from this boasting no man shall seal up my lips in the regions of Achaia.
047	2CO	011	011	Wherefore? Because I love you not? God knoweth.
047	2CO	011	012	But what I do, I will do also, that I may cut off occasion from those who desire occasion, that wherein they boast, they may be found even as we.
047	2CO	011	013	For such are fake apostles, deceitful labourers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ.
047	2CO	011	014	And no marvel! For Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.
047	2CO	011	015	It is no wonder therefore if his ministers also be transformed as ministers of righteousness; whose end will be according to their works.
047	2CO	011	016	I repeat it again, Let no man suppose that I am a fool; but if otherwise, then as a fool receive me, that I too may boast myself a little.
047	2CO	011	017	What I speak, I speak not after the Lord, but as it were in folly in this confidence of boasting.
047	2CO	011	018	Seeing many boast themselves after the flesh, I will boast also.
047	2CO	011	019	For ye bear with fools easily when you are wise yourselves.
047	2CO	011	020	For ye bear if a man enslave you, if a man eat you up, if a man receive from you, if a man is insolent, if a man smite you on the face.
047	2CO	011	021	I speak with reference to the reproach cast on me, as though we were feeble; but wherein any man is bold (I speak in foolishness), I am bold also.
047	2CO	011	022	Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.
047	2CO	011	023	Are they the ministers of Christ? (I speak foolishly) I am above them: in labours more abundantly, in stripes exceedingly more, in prisons more frequently, in the most immediate danger of death often.
047	2CO	011	024	Of the Jews five times I have received forty stripes save one.
047	2CO	011	025	Thrice I have been scourged with rods, once I have been stoned, thrice I have suffered shipwreck, a whole night and day I have passed in the deep;
047	2CO	011	026	in journeyings often, in perils of rivers, in perils of robbers, in perils from my own countrymen, in perils from the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the desert, in perils on the sea, in perils among false brethren;
047	2CO	011	027	in labour and travail, in watchings often, in fastings frequently, in hunger and thirst, in cold and nakedness;
047	2CO	011	028	and beside all these things from without, that accumulated burden which cometh on me daily, the care of all the churches.
047	2CO	011	029	Who is feeble, and am I not feeble? Who is offended, and am I not on fire?
047	2CO	011	030	If I must glory, I will glory in the things which respect my infirmities.
047	2CO	011	031	The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.
047	2CO	011	032	In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of the Damascenes, intending to seize me;
047	2CO	011	033	and through a window in a basket I was let down by the wall, and escaped out of his hands.
047	2CO	012	001	IT is not expedient doubtless for me to boast. I will yet come to visions and revelations of the Lord.
047	2CO	012	002	I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body I know not, or whether out of the body I know not: God knoweth; ) such a one was caught up unto the third heavens.
047	2CO	012	003	And I knew such a man, (whether in the body or out of the body I know not: God knoweth, )
047	2CO	012	004	that he was caught up into paradise, and heard ineffable words, which it is not permitted to man to speak.
047	2CO	012	005	Of such a one will I boast; but in myself will I not boast, save in my infirmities.
047	2CO	012	006	For though I should be disposed to boast, I shall not be a fool; for I shall speak truth: but I desist, lest any man think of me above what he seeth me to be, or what he heareth of me.
047	2CO	012	007	And that I might not be lifted up above measure by the transcendent greatness of the revelations, there was given me a thorn in the flesh, the angel Satan, to buffet me, that I might not be lifted up above measure.
047	2CO	012	008	For this thrice I besought the Lord, that he might depart from me.
047	2CO	012	009	And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee; for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may fix its residence in me.
047	2CO	012	010	Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ’s sake; for when I am weak, then am I strong.
047	2CO	012	011	Have I become a fool in boasting? ye have compelled me; for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing have I been inferior to the very chief apostles, though I be nothing.
047	2CO	012	012	The signs indeed of an apostle have been wrought among you in all patience, in miracles, and wonders, and mighty deeds.
047	2CO	012	013	For what is there wherein ye have been inferior to the other churches, except that I have not been burdensome to you? Forgive me this wrong.
047	2CO	012	014	Lo! I hold myself ready the third time to come unto you, and I will not burden you; for I seek not yours but you: for the children ought not to lay up treasure for their parents, but the parents for the children.
047	2CO	012	015	And I will most cheerfully spend and be spent for your souls, though the more abundantly I love you, the less I am loved.
047	2CO	012	016	But admit it, I was not burdensome to you: but being crafty, I caught you with guile.
047	2CO	012	017	Did I make a gain of you by any one individual whom I sent unto you?
047	2CO	012	018	I entreated Titus to go to you, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make any advantage of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?
047	2CO	012	019	Think ye that we are again making an apology to you? In the sight of God speak we in Christ: but all things, beloved, for your edification.
047	2CO	012	020	For I am afraid that when I come I shall not find you such as I wish, and that I shall be found of you such as ye would not: lest haply there be contentions, jealousies, animosities, quarrels, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:
047	2CO	012	021	and lest when I come to you again, my God should bow me down, and I should lament over many who have sinned before, and have not repented of the impurities, and whoredom, and lasciviousness which they have committed.
047	2CO	013	001	THIS third time I am coming to you: by the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every charge be established.
047	2CO	013	002	I have told you before, and I repeat it, as when I was present the second time, and now absent, I write to those who have sinned already, and to all the rest, that if I come again, I will not spare you:
047	2CO	013	003	since ye demand a proof that Christ speaketh in me, who to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.
047	2CO	013	004	For though he was crucified in weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God: for we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God displayed towards you.
047	2CO	013	005	Examine yourselves, whether ye are in the faith; prove your ownselves: know ye not your ownselves, that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobate?
047	2CO	013	006	But I hope that ye shall know that we are not reprobate.
047	2CO	013	007	Now I pray unto God that ye do no evil, not that we should appear approved, but that you may do that which is laudable, though we should be as reprobates.
047	2CO	013	008	For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.
047	2CO	013	009	For we rejoice when we are weak, but ye are strong: and this also we pray for, even your perfect establishment.
047	2CO	013	010	For this cause, though absent, I have written these things, that when I am present I may not use severity, according to the power which the Lord hath given me for edification, and not for destruction.
047	2CO	013	011	Finally, brethren, rejoice: be perfectly united together, be comforted, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.
047	2CO	013	012	Salute one another with a holy kiss.
047	2CO	013	013	All the saints salute you.
047	2CO	013	014	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost be with you all. Amen. The second epistle to the Corinthians was written from Philippi, a city of Macedonia, by Titus and Luke.

# BOOK	048	GAL	Galatians	Galatians
048	GAL	001	001	PAUL the apostle (not sent from men, nor by man, but by Jesus Christ, and our Father who raised him from the dead),
048	GAL	001	002	and all the brethren with me, to the churches of Galatia:
048	GAL	001	003	grace unto you, and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ;
048	GAL	001	004	who gave himself for our sins, that he might pluck us out of this present wicked world, according to the will of God and our Father:
048	GAL	001	005	to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
048	GAL	001	006	I marvel that ye are so quickly departed from him that called you, by the grace of Christ into another gospel
048	GAL	001	007	which is not another; but there are certain persons who trouble you, and desire to pervert the gospel of Christ.
048	GAL	001	008	But though even we, or an angel from heaven, preach unto you another gospel, different from that which we have preached to you, let him be an anathema.
048	GAL	001	009	As we have before spoken, and I now repeat it again, If any man preach a gospel different from that ye have received, let him be anathema.
048	GAL	001	010	For do I now use persuasions from men, or from God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.
048	GAL	001	011	But I give you to understand, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not a merely human ministry.
048	GAL	001	012	For I neither received it from man, nor was taught, but by immediate revelation from Jesus Christ.
048	GAL	001	013	For ye have heard of my former manner of life, when I professed Judaism, that in the most outrageous manner I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:
048	GAL	001	014	and signalized myself in Judaism above many of those of my own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly a zealot for the traditions of my fathers.
048	GAL	001	015	But when it pleased God, who selected me from my mother’s womb, and called me by his grace,
048	GAL	001	016	to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach the glad tidings of him to the nations, immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood,
048	GAL	001	017	nor went up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me; but I went away into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.
048	GAL	001	018	Afterwards at the expiration of three years I went up unto Jerusalem to pay a visit to Peter, and I abode with him fifteen days.
048	GAL	001	019	But I saw no other of the apostles except James, the Lord’s brother.
048	GAL	001	020	Now respecting the things which I write unto you, behold, in the presence of God, I lie not.
048	GAL	001	021	Afterwards I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;
048	GAL	001	022	and I was personally unknown to the churches of Judea, which are in Christ:
048	GAL	001	023	only they had heard, that he who persecuted us in time past, now preaches the faith which he once laid waste.
048	GAL	001	024	And they glorified God on my behalf.
048	GAL	002	001	FOURTEEN years afterwards I again went up to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also along with us.
048	GAL	002	002	And I went up then by revelation, and laid before them that gospel which I preach among the Heathen, but in private conference with those who were of the first importance, that haply I might not run, nor had run in vain.
048	GAL	002	003	And even Titus, who was with me, though a Greek, was not compelled to be circumcised:
048	GAL	002	004	but this I did because of false brethren artfully introduced, who came to pry into our liberty which we hold in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:
048	GAL	002	005	to whom not even for an hour have we yielded subjection, that the truth of the gospel might abide with you.
048	GAL	002	006	But from those who appeared men of the greatest importance, (what sort of men soever they were it maketh no difference to me: God accepteth not a man’s person; ) for these important personages in conference added nothing to me;
048	GAL	002	007	but contrariwise when they saw that I was entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcision, as Peter was to the circumcision:
048	GAL	002	008	(for he that wrought powerfully by Peter in his apostolic mission to the circumcision, wrought mightily also by me among the Gentiles.)
048	GAL	002	009	And when they knew the grace which was bestowed on me, James and Cephas and John, who appeared to be the pillars of the church, gave unto me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should go unto the Gentiles, and they to the circumcision:
048	GAL	002	010	only desiring that we would remember the poor―the very thing which I have also been diligent to perform.
048	GAL	002	011	But when Peter came to Antioch I withstood him to his face, because he was blameable.
048	GAL	002	012	For before certain persons came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles, but when they were come, he withdrew, and separated himself, fearing those of the circumcision.
048	GAL	002	013	And the other Jews were guilty of the same dissimulation with him, so that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy.
048	GAL	002	014	But when I saw that they walked not directly according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest as the Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to judaize?
048	GAL	002	015	We who are Jews by descent, and not sinners sprung from Gentiles,
048	GAL	002	016	knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by works of the law; because by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.
048	GAL	002	017	For if seeking to be justified by Christ, we also ourselves should be found sinners, is Christ then a minister of sin? God forbid.
048	GAL	002	018	For if I build up again the very same things which I have pulled down, I stamp myself a transgressor.
048	GAL	002	019	For I through the law am dead to the law, that I should live unto God.
048	GAL	002	020	I am crucified with Christ, yet I live; though no more I, but Christ liveth in me: and my present life in the flesh, is a life by faith in the Son of God, who hath loved me, and delivered up himself for me.
048	GAL	002	021	I do not set at nought the grace of God; for if righteousness came by the law, truly Christ hath died in vain.
048	GAL	003	001	O INFATUATED Galatians, who hath bewitched you that ye should not obey the truth? To whom Jesus Christ has been described, as before your eyes, crucified among you.
048	GAL	003	002	This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or from hearing of the faith?
048	GAL	003	003	Are ye so senseless? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect in the flesh?
048	GAL	003	004	have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.
048	GAL	003	005	He therefore who ministereth to you a supply of the Spirit, and powerfully worketh miracles among you, doth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of the faith?
048	GAL	003	006	as Abraham believed in God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness.
048	GAL	003	007	Know then that they who are of faith, these are the children of Abraham.
048	GAL	003	008	And the scripture foreseeing that by faith God would justify the Gentiles, preached the gospel before unto Abraham, saying, that “In thee shall all the nations be blessed.”
048	GAL	003	009	Wherefore they who are of faith are blessed with believing Abraham.
048	GAL	003	010	For as many as are of the works of the law, are under a curse: for it is written, “Cursed is every one who continueth not in all the things written in the book of the law to do them.”
048	GAL	003	011	But that by the law no man is justified before God is evident: because “The just by faith shall live.”
048	GAL	003	012	Now the law is not by faith: but “The man that doeth these things shall live by them.”
048	GAL	003	013	Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, “Cursed is every one who is hanged on a tree:”
048	GAL	003	014	that unto the Gentiles the benediction pronounced on Abraham might come by Jesus Christ, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit by faith.
048	GAL	003	015	Brethren, I speak humanly; to use a similitude, a man’s testament, if it be passed in legal form, no man can vacate, or add thereunto.
048	GAL	003	016	But to Abraham were the promises spoken, and to his seed. He saith not, To seeds, as unto many persons; but as to an individual, and to thy seed, which is Christ.
048	GAL	003	017	Now this I say, the covenant confirmed of God to Christ, the law, which was given three hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, so as to vacate the promise.
048	GAL	003	018	For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more by promise; but to Abraham God gave it freely by promise.
048	GAL	003	019	To what end then was the law given? It was given on account of transgressions, until that seed should come to whom the promise was made, being delivered through the ministry of angels into the hand of a mediator.
048	GAL	003	020	But the mediator of the one seed he is not, though God is one.
048	GAL	003	021	Is the law then contrary to the promises of God? God forbid. For if there had been a law given which was capable of procuring life, verily righteousness would have been by the law.
048	GAL	003	022	But the scripture hath shut up all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.
048	GAL	003	023	But before the faith came, we were in ward under the law, shut up together for the faith that should be revealed.
048	GAL	003	024	Wherefore the law was our conductor, as of children, to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.
048	GAL	003	025	But when faith was come, we were no longer under a paedagogue.
048	GAL	003	026	For ye are all the sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.
048	GAL	003	027	For as many of you as have been baptised into Christ, have been invested with Christ.
048	GAL	003	028	There is no more Jew or Gentile, there is no more slave or freeman, there is no more male or female: but ye are all one in Christ Jesus.
048	GAL	003	029	But if ye are Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.
048	GAL	004	001	NOW I affirm, that as long as the heir is an infant, he differeth nothing from a servant, though he be master of all;
048	GAL	004	002	but is under tutors and trustees until the time fixed by his father.
048	GAL	004	003	So we also, when we were infants, were in bondage under the first elementary principles of the world:
048	GAL	004	004	but when the fulness of time was come, God sent forth his Son born of a woman, born under the law,
048	GAL	004	005	that he might redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.
048	GAL	004	006	But because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father!
048	GAL	004	007	Therefore thou art no more a slave, but a son, and if a son, an heir also of God through Christ.
048	GAL	004	008	But at that time when ye knew not God, ye served those who by nature are not gods.
048	GAL	004	009	But now after having known God, or rather being known of God, how turn ye back again to those weak and beggarly elements, to which again a second time ye desire to be in bondage?
048	GAL	004	010	Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.
048	GAL	004	011	I am afraid for you, lest haply I have bestowed on you labour in vain.
048	GAL	004	012	Be as I am, for I also am as ye are, brethren―this is my request to you: ye have not injured me in the least.
048	GAL	004	013	Ye know that with infirmity of flesh I preached to you the gospel at the first.
048	GAL	004	014	And my temptation, which was in my flesh, ye despised not, nor rejected with disgust; but as an angel of God ye received me, even as Christ Jesus himself.
048	GAL	004	015	What then was your blessedness, for I bear witness to you that, if it were possible, ye would have plucked out your eyes, and given them to me.
048	GAL	004	016	Am I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth?
048	GAL	004	017	They affect zeal for you, not honourably; but they wish to exclude us, that you may be zealously attached to them.
048	GAL	004	018	It is good indeed to be zealously affected in a good cause always, and not only when I am present with you.
048	GAL	004	019	My little children of whom I travail in birth again, until Christ be formed in you,
048	GAL	004	020	I wish I could be with you now, and change my address; for I am in doubt about you.
048	GAL	004	021	Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?
048	GAL	004	022	For it is written that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondwoman, and the other by a free.
048	GAL	004	023	Now the son of the bond-maid was born after the flesh, but that by the free woman was by promise.
048	GAL	004	024	Which things are allegorical; for these are the two covenants, the one from mount Sinai, gendering unto bondage, which is represented by Agar.
048	GAL	004	025	For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds with Jerusalem that now is, and is in bondage with her children.
048	GAL	004	026	But the Jerusalem above is free, which is the mother of us all.
048	GAL	004	027	For it is written, “Rejoice, thou barren who bearest not, cry out and shout for joy, thou that travailest not, for more are the children of her that was desolate, than of her which had an husband.”
048	GAL	004	028	So we, brethren, as Isaac, are the children of the promise.
048	GAL	004	029	But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so is it now.
048	GAL	004	030	But what saith the scripture? “Cast out the bond-woman and her son for the son of the bond-maid shall in no wise inherit with the son of the free woman.”
048	GAL	004	031	So then, brethren, we are not the children of the bondwoman, but of the free.
048	GAL	005	001	STAND fast therefore in the liberty with which Christ has made you free, and be not again held under a yoke of bondage.
048	GAL	005	002	Behold, I Paul declare to you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ will be of no advantage to you.
048	GAL	005	003	And again, I testify to every man who is circumcised, that he is under an obligation to keep the whole law.
048	GAL	005	004	Ye have vacated all expectations from Christ, as many of you as are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.
048	GAL	005	005	For we in spirit by faith expect the hope of righteousness.
048	GAL	005	006	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but faith exerting its energy by love.
048	GAL	005	007	Ye were running well: who hath hindered you that ye should not obey the truth?
048	GAL	005	008	This persuasion cometh not from him who called you.
048	GAL	005	009	A little leaven leaveneth the whole mass.
048	GAL	005	010	I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be no otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear condign punishment whosoever he be.
048	GAL	005	011	But I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? then indeed the offence of the cross is at an end.
048	GAL	005	012	I wish that they who trouble you were cut off from you.
048	GAL	005	013	For ye have been called unto liberty, brethren; only use not that liberty as a pretext for carnality, but in love be subject one to another.
048	GAL	005	014	For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, even in this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
048	GAL	005	015	But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed by one another.
048	GAL	005	016	But I say, Walk in the Spirit, and ye will not fulfil the lust of the flesh.
048	GAL	005	017	For the flesh hath appetites contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit contrary to the flesh, and these act in opposition the one to the other: so that ye do not the things which ye would.
048	GAL	005	018	But if ye are under the conduct of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.
048	GAL	005	019	Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are these: adultery, whoredom, impurity, lasciviousness,
048	GAL	005	020	idolatry, magical charms, enmities, strifes, jealousies, animosities, quarrels, divisions, heresies,
048	GAL	005	021	envyings, murders, drunkenness, revels, and the like of these, concerning which I tell you now, as I have told you already, that they who live in such practices shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
048	GAL	005	022	But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, fidelity,
048	GAL	005	023	meekness, temperance; against such there is no law.
048	GAL	005	024	But they who are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with its passions and irregular appetites.
048	GAL	005	025	If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.
048	GAL	005	026	Let us not be vain-glorious, irritating one another, envying one another.
048	GAL	006	001	BRETHREN, if a man also be surprised into any act of offence, ye that are spiritual, replace such a one in the spirit of meekness; keeping an attentive eye on thyself, lest thou also be tempted.
048	GAL	006	002	Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.
048	GAL	006	003	For if any man conceits that he is something when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.
048	GAL	006	004	But let every man bring his own work to the test, and then shall he have glorying in himself alone, and not by comparison with another.
048	GAL	006	005	For every man shall bear his own burden.
048	GAL	006	006	Let him who is a learner of the word communicate to his instructor in all good things.
048	GAL	006	007	Be not deceived; God is not to be trifled with: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.
048	GAL	006	008	For he that soweth unto his flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption, and he that soweth to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.
048	GAL	006	009	Let us not then be weary of well-doing; for in due time we shall reap, if we faint not.
048	GAL	006	010	Well then, whilst we have opportunity, let us do good unto all men, but especially unto those who are of the household of faith.
048	GAL	006	011	Ye see in how many words I have written unto you with my own hand.
048	GAL	006	012	As many as wish to make a fair appearance in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised, only that they may not suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.
048	GAL	006	013	For even they who are themselves circumcised do not keep the law, but desire you to be circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.
048	GAL	006	014	But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world,
048	GAL	006	015	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.
048	GAL	006	016	And as many as shall walk after this rule, peace be upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.
048	GAL	006	017	Henceforth let no man trouble me; for I bear the marks of our Lord Jesus Christ in my body.
048	GAL	006	018	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen. To the Galatians, written from Rome.

# BOOK	049	EPH	Ephesians	Ephesians
049	EPH	001	001	PAUL, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:
049	EPH	001	002	grace be unto you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
049	EPH	001	003	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with every spiritual blessing in heavenly things in Christ;
049	EPH	001	004	as he hath elected us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him in love:
049	EPH	001	005	having predestinated us for his adopted children by Jesus Christ unto himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,
049	EPH	001	006	to the praise of the glory of his grace, whereby he hath made us acceptable in that beloved one;
049	EPH	001	007	in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;
049	EPH	001	008	wherein he hath abounded towards us with all wisdom and intelligence,
049	EPH	001	009	having made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in himself;
049	EPH	001	010	at the dispensation of the fulness of the appointed times to gather together under one head all things in Christ, whether they be things in heaven or things in earth, in him:
049	EPH	001	011	in whom also we have obtained our inheritance, predestinated according to the purpose of him who effectually worketh all things according to the counsel of his own will:
049	EPH	001	012	that we should be to the praise of his glory, who first had hope in Christ.
049	EPH	001	013	In whom ye also trusted after ye had heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, ye have been sealed with the holy Spirit of promise,
049	EPH	001	014	which is the earnest of our inheritance, until the final redemption, acquired by him, come, to the praise of his glory.
049	EPH	001	015	For this cause I also, since I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and the love ye have to all saints,
049	EPH	001	016	have not ceased offering up my praises for you, making mention of you in my prayers,
049	EPH	001	017	that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, would give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation by the knowledge of him;
049	EPH	001	018	the eyes of your understanding being enlightened, that you may know what is the hope to which he hath called you, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance for the saints,
049	EPH	001	019	and what the transcendent greatness of his power in us, who believe, according to the energy of his mighty strength
049	EPH	001	020	which he displayed in Christ when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly regions,
049	EPH	001	021	far above all principality, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come;
049	EPH	001	022	and hath put all things under his feet, and hath appointed him head over all to the church,
049	EPH	001	023	which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.
049	EPH	002	001	AND you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins,
049	EPH	002	002	wherein in times past ye walked after the fashion of this world, after the prince of the power of the air, the spirit who now worketh with energy in the children of disobedience:
049	EPH	002	003	among whom also we all have had our conversation in time past, in the lusts of the flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, as well as the rest.
049	EPH	002	004	But God, being rich in mercy, through the great love with which he hath loved us,
049	EPH	002	005	though we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved, )
049	EPH	002	006	and hath raised us up together with him, and made us sit down together in the heavenly regions in Christ Jesus.
049	EPH	002	007	That he might shew forth in the ages to come the transcendent riches of his grace, in the kindness shewed to us in Christ Jesus.
049	EPH	002	008	For by grace ye are saved through faith, and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God:
049	EPH	002	009	not by works, lest any man should boast;
049	EPH	002	010	for we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, for which God hath before prepared us, that we should walk therein.
049	EPH	002	011	Wherefore remember that ye in time past were Gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncircumcision by that called circumcision made by hands in the flesh;
049	EPH	002	012	that ye were at that time without Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope, and atheists in the world:
049	EPH	002	013	but now in Christ Jesus, ye who formerly were far off, are become nigh by the blood of Christ.
049	EPH	002	014	For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of separation,
049	EPH	002	015	destroying the enmity in his flesh, even the law of precepts, in ordinances, that he might from the two create in himself one new man, making peace,
049	EPH	002	016	and might reconcile them both in one body to God by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby;
049	EPH	002	017	and coming, hath preached peace to you who were afar off, and to those who were nigh:
049	EPH	002	018	for through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.
049	EPH	002	019	So then ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God;
049	EPH	002	020	built up on the foundation of apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;
049	EPH	002	021	in whom the whole building exactly cemented together groweth into a holy temple in the Lord:
049	EPH	002	022	by whom also ye have been built up together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.
049	EPH	003	001	FOR this cause am I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,
049	EPH	003	002	if so be, that ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which was given to me for you:
049	EPH	003	003	that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery, as I wrote unto you before briefly;
049	EPH	003	004	wherein when ye read, ye may be able to perceive my knowledge in the mystery of Christ,
049	EPH	003	005	which in other generations was not made known to the children of men, as it hath been now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;
049	EPH	003	006	that the Gentiles should be co-heirs, and of the same body, and sharers with them of his promise in Christ by the Gospel:
049	EPH	003	007	of which I am made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God, which was given unto me by the effectual working of his power.
049	EPH	003	008	To me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;
049	EPH	003	009	and to make all men see what the communication of that mystery means, which was hid from the beginning in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:
049	EPH	003	010	that now to the principalities and powers in the heavenly regions, the manifold wisdom of God might be made known by the church,
049	EPH	003	011	according to the purpose from everlasting, which he formed in Christ Jesus our Lord:
049	EPH	003	012	in whom we have boldness and access with confidence to God by the faith of him.
049	EPH	003	013	Wherefore 1 beseech you, that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.
049	EPH	003	014	For this end I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
049	EPH	003	015	of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named;
049	EPH	003	016	that he would give you according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man;
049	EPH	003	017	that Christ may dwell by faith in your hearts; that rooted and grounded in love,
049	EPH	003	018	ye may be strengthened to comprehend with all saints, what is the breadth and length, and height and depth;
049	EPH	003	019	and to know the love of Christ, transcendently surpassing knowledge, that ye may be filled with all the fulness of God.
049	EPH	003	020	Now to him that is able to do above all things, exceeding abundantly, beyond what we ask or think, according to the power which effectually worketh in us;
049	EPH	003	021	to him be glory in the church, in Christ Jesus, unto all generations for ever and ever. Amen.
049	EPH	004	001	I THEN, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you, that ye walk worthy of the vocation with which ye are called,
049	EPH	004	002	with all humility and meekness, with long suffering, forbearing one another in love;
049	EPH	004	003	careful to preserve unity of spirit, in the bond of peace.
049	EPH	004	004	There is one body, and one spirit, even as ye have been called to one hope of your calling;
049	EPH	004	005	one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
049	EPH	004	006	one God, and father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.
049	EPH	004	007	But to every one of us hath the grace been given, according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
049	EPH	004	008	Wherefore the Scripture saith, “When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.”
049	EPH	004	009	Now this, that he ascended, what does it imply? but that he also first descended into the more internal parts of the earth?
049	EPH	004	010	He that descended is the same also, who ascended above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.
049	EPH	004	011	And he himself appointed, some indeed apostles, and some prophets; and others preachers of the Gospel; and others pastors and teachers;
049	EPH	004	012	for the perfecting the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edification of the body of Christ:
049	EPH	004	013	until we all attain in the unity of the faith, and the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a state of complete manhood, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:
049	EPH	004	014	that we should be no longer infants, floating on the waves, and carried about with every wind of novel doctrine, by the juggling of men, by their craftiness after the delusive wiles of error;
049	EPH	004	015	but, speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, who is the head, even Christ:
049	EPH	004	016	From whom the whole body nicely joined together, and firmly connected by every joint of exact proportion, according to the energy exerted in the measure of every several part, causeth the increase of the body unto the edification of itself in love.
049	EPH	004	017	This then I urge and testify in the Lord, that ye walk no more as the other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind,
049	EPH	004	018	darkened in understanding; alienated from the life of God through the ignorance which is in them; through the blindness of their hearts:
049	EPH	004	019	who insensible to remorse, have delivered themselves over in lasciviousness, to the practice of all impurity, with insatiable avidity.
049	EPH	004	020	But ye have not so learned Christ;
049	EPH	004	021	if indeed ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus:
049	EPH	004	022	that ye put off respecting your former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful passions;
049	EPH	004	023	but be renewed in the spirit of your minds;
049	EPH	004	024	and put on the new man, which is created godlike, in righteousness and true holiness.
049	EPH	004	025	Wherefore putting away lying, speak truth, every one with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.
049	EPH	004	026	Are ye provoked; and do you not sin? let not the sun go down upon your wrath:
049	EPH	004	027	nor give place to the devil.
049	EPH	004	028	Let him that stole steal no more; but rather labour hard, working with his hands that which is good, that he may have something to give to him that is in want.
049	EPH	004	029	Let no loose discourse proceed out of your mouth, but whatever is good for useful edification, that it may communicate grace to the hearers.
049	EPH	004	030	And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye have been sealed unto the day of redemption.
049	EPH	004	031	Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and scandal, be removed from you, with all malice:
049	EPH	004	032	but be ye kind one to another, full of sensibility, forgiving mutually, even as God in Christ hath forgiven you.
049	EPH	005	001	BE ye therefore imitators of God, as beloved children;
049	EPH	005	002	and walk in love as Christ also hath loved us, and given himself for us, an oblation and sacrifice to God, for an odour of a sweet smell.
049	EPH	005	003	But fornication and all impurity, or insatiable desire, let it not be mentioned among you, as becometh saints;
049	EPH	005	004	or obscenity, or foolish talk, or loose witticisms; things which become not a Christian, but rather thanksgiving.
049	EPH	005	005	For this ye know, that no whoremonger, or impure person, or avaricious, who is an idolater, hath an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
049	EPH	005	006	Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things, the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience.
049	EPH	005	007	Be not ye therefore partakers with them.
049	EPH	005	008	For ye were formerly darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light;
049	EPH	005	009	(for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth; )
049	EPH	005	010	proving what is acceptable to the Lord.
049	EPH	005	011	And have no society with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather rebuke them.
049	EPH	005	012	For it is scandalous but to mention the things done of them in secret.
049	EPH	005	013	But all things which are rebukeable are made manifest by the light; for it is the light, by which every thing is made manifest.
049	EPH	005	014	Wherefore he saith, “Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.”
049	EPH	005	015	Take heed, then, that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,
049	EPH	005	016	redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
049	EPH	005	017	Therefore be not unwise, but intelligent concerning what is the will of the Lord.
049	EPH	005	018	And be not drunk with wine, in which there is sottishness, but be filled with the Spirit;
049	EPH	005	019	speaking one to another in psalms and hymns, and spiritual canticles, singing and making melody in the heart to the Lord;
049	EPH	005	020	giving thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God even the Father;
049	EPH	005	021	being subject one to another in the fear of God.
049	EPH	005	022	Wives, be in subjection to your own husbands, as to the Lord.
049	EPH	005	023	For the husband is the head of the wife, as also Christ is the head of the church; and is himself the saviour of the body.
049	EPH	005	024	As then the church is subject to Christ, so also let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.
049	EPH	005	025	Husbands, love your own wives, as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;
049	EPH	005	026	that he might sanctify it, purifying it in the laver of water by the word,
049	EPH	005	027	that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having blemish, nor wrinkle, nor any such things; but that it may be holy and unblameable.
049	EPH	005	028	So ought husbands to love their own wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his own wife loveth himself.
049	EPH	005	029	For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:
049	EPH	005	030	for we are the members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.
049	EPH	005	031	For this reason shall a man forsake his father and mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and the two shall be as one flesh.
049	EPH	005	032	This mystery is great: but I am speaking with regard to Christ, and with regard to the church.
049	EPH	005	033	Nevertheless let every one of you individually see that each love his own wife even as himself; but the wife that she stand in awe of the husband.
049	EPH	006	001	CHILDREN, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.
049	EPH	006	002	“Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with a promise; )
049	EPH	006	003	that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest be long-lived upon earth.”
049	EPH	006	004	And, ye fathers, exasperate not your children: but educate them in the discipline and admonition of the Lord.
049	EPH	006	005	Servants, be obedient to your masters after the flesh, with fear and trembling, in simplicity of your heart as unto Christ;
049	EPH	006	006	not with eye-service, as men-pleasers; but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the soul;
049	EPH	006	007	with good will doing service as to the Lord, and not unto men:
049	EPH	006	008	knowing that whatsoever good a man doeth, the same shall he receive from the Lord, whether he be a bondman, or whether he be free.
049	EPH	006	009	And ye masters, do the same things to them, avoiding menacing language: knowing that you also yourselves have a master in heaven; and there is no respect of persons with him.
049	EPH	006	010	Finally, brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.
049	EPH	006	011	Be clothed in the panoply of God, that we may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.
049	EPH	006	012	For our conflict is not merely against flesh and blood, but against principalities, and against powers, and against the rulers of the darkness of this world, and against wicked spirits in the aerial regions.
049	EPH	006	013	Therefore take the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all things to stand.
049	EPH	006	014	Stand therefore, girded about your loins with truth, and putting on the breastplate of righteousness;
049	EPH	006	015	and underneath your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;
049	EPH	006	016	and over all lifting up the shield of faith, with which ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one.
049	EPH	006	017	And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:
049	EPH	006	018	praying at every opportunity with all prayer and supplication in Spirit, and watching for this very purpose with perseverance and intercession for all the saints;
049	EPH	006	019	and for me that there may be given unto me utterance to open my mouth with boldness, to make known the mystery of the gospel,
049	EPH	006	020	for which I am an ambassador in bonds; that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.
049	EPH	006	021	But that ye also may know the things which concern me, and what I am doing, Tychicus will inform you of the whole, a beloved brother, and faithful in the Lord:
049	EPH	006	022	whom I have sent unto you for this very purpose, that ye may know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.
049	EPH	006	023	Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
049	EPH	006	024	Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Written to the Ephesians from Rome by Tychicus.

# BOOK	050	PHI	Philippians	Philippians
050	PHI	001	001	PAUL and Timothy, servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:
050	PHI	001	002	grace be unto you and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
050	PHI	001	003	I give thanks to my God on every remembrance of you,
050	PHI	001	004	always in every prayer of mine for you all, making request with joy,
050	PHI	001	005	for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day even until now;
050	PHI	001	006	being confident of this very thing, that he who hath wrought in you the good work will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ:
050	PHI	001	007	as it is right for me to think this of you all, because I bear you on my heart, both in my bonds and in my defence and the confirmation of the gospel, as being all of you sharers in my grace.
050	PHI	001	008	For God is my witness, how earnestly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.
050	PHI	001	009	And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all understanding;
050	PHI	001	010	that ye may prove the things that are excellent, in order that ye may be sincere and without offence unto the day of Christ;
050	PHI	001	011	filled with fruits of righteousness, which by Jesus Christ are to the glory and praise of God.
050	PHI	001	012	Now I wish you, brethren, to know, that the things which have befallen me have rather conduced to the progress of the gospel;
050	PHI	001	013	so that my bonds are manifest in Christ through the whole palace, and all other places;
050	PHI	001	014	and very many of our brethren in the Lord, assuming confidence from my chains, are more abundantly bold, fearlessly to preach the word.
050	PHI	001	015	Some indeed do it in a spirit of envy and strife; but some also preach Christ with cordial good-will:
050	PHI	001	016	the one indeed preach Christ out of contention, not with purity of intention, thinking to add affliction to my bonds:
050	PHI	001	017	but the others of love, knowing that I am exposed for the defence of the gospel.
050	PHI	001	018	What then? if Christ is preached in whatever manner it be, whether in pretext or reality, even in this do I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.
050	PHI	001	019	For I know that this shall issue in my salvation through your prayers, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
050	PHI	001	020	according to my firm expectation and hope, that I shall be confounded by no event, but that with all boldness, as always hitherto, Christ shall now also be magnified in my body, whether by my life or death.
050	PHI	001	021	For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
050	PHI	001	022	But if it be his will, that I should live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my travail: and what to chuse I know not.
050	PHI	001	023	For I am in a strait between the two, having an earnest longing to be dissolved, and to be with Christ, for this is far, far better:
050	PHI	001	024	but to abide in the flesh may be more necessary for you.
050	PHI	001	025	And being so persuaded, I know that I shall stay and continue with you all for your progress and joy of faith;
050	PHI	001	026	that your glorying may abound in Christ Jesus for me by my coming again unto you.
050	PHI	001	027	Only conduct yourselves worthily as becometh the gospel of Christ; that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one soul wrestling together in the faith of the gospel;
050	PHI	001	028	and not dismayed on any occasion by your adversaries; which is indeed the proof of perdition to them, but of salvation to you, and that from God.
050	PHI	001	029	For this favour on the part of Christ is granted you, not only that ye should believe on him, but also that ye should suffer for his sake;
050	PHI	001	030	experiencing the same conflict which ye have seen in me, and now hear to be in me.
050	PHI	002	001	IF there be then any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any communion of spirit, if any bowels and compassions,
050	PHI	002	002	fulfil ye my joy, that ye may be united in sentiment, having the same love, of one soul, of one mind.
050	PHI	002	003	Let nothing be done contentiously or vain-gloriously; but in humility reckoning others superior to yourselves.
050	PHI	002	004	Let not each aim at their own particular interests, but every man at those of others.
050	PHI	002	005	Let the same sentiment of mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:
050	PHI	002	006	who being in the form of God counted it no usurpation to claim equality with God:
050	PHI	002	007	but emptied himself, assuming the form of a servant, made after the similitude of mortal men;
050	PHI	002	008	and found in fashion as man, he humbled himself, becoming obedient to death, even to the death of the cross.
050	PHI	002	009	Wherefore God also hath transcendently exalted him, and bestowed on him a name which is above every name:
050	PHI	002	010	that to the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of beings celestial and terrestrial, and infernal;
050	PHI	002	011	and every tongue should confess that the Lord Jesus is Messiah, to the glory of God the Father.
050	PHI	002	012	Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always been obedient, not only during my presence with you, but now much more in my absence, with fear and trembling work out your own salvation.
050	PHI	002	013	For it is God who worketh effectually in you both to will and to perform of his good pleasure.
050	PHI	002	014	Do all things without murmurings or disputes:
050	PHI	002	015	that ye may be blameless and harmless, the children of God, inoffensive, in the midst of an untoward and perverse generation, among whom ye shine as luminaries in the world;
050	PHI	002	016	holding up the word of life, that I may glory in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, nor laboured in vain.
050	PHI	002	017	Yea, and should I become the victim, in the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.
050	PHI	002	018	In like manner do ye also joy and rejoice with me.
050	PHI	002	019	But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly unto you, that I also may be refreshed in spirit, when I know your affairs.
050	PHI	002	020	For I have no one like minded with him, who will genuinely care for your affairs.
050	PHI	002	021	For all seek their own interests, not those of Christ Jesus.
050	PHI	002	022	But ye have known the trial of him, that, as a son with a father, he hath served with me in the gospel.
050	PHI	002	023	Him therefore I hope to send immediately as soon as I see clearly what will become of me.
050	PHI	002	024	But I have confidence in the Lord that I myself shall come shortly.
050	PHI	002	025	But I have thought it necessary to send unto you Epaphroditus, my brother, and fellow-labourer, and fellow-soldier, but your messenger, and the minister who supplied my want.
050	PHI	002	026	For indeed he greatly longed after you all, and was very sorry that ye had heard that he had been sick.
050	PHI	002	027	For sick indeed he was, nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.
050	PHI	002	028	I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that seeing him once more ye may rejoice, and I be less sorrowful.
050	PHI	002	029	Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy, and honourably treat those that are such:
050	PHI	002	030	for in the work of Christ he was nigh unto death indifferent about life, that he might afford me that service which it was not in your power to render me.
050	PHI	003	001	MOREOVER, brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not irksome, but is safe for you.
050	PHI	003	002	Beware of dogs, beware of the malicious labourers, beware of the concision.
050	PHI	003	003	For we are the circumcision, who serve God in spirit, and glory in Christ Jesus, and put no confidence in the flesh.
050	PHI	003	004	Though I too might have confidence in the flesh; if any other man thinks that he may have confidence in the flesh, I may claim more:
050	PHI	003	005	circumcised the eighth day, of the race of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews;
050	PHI	003	006	respecting the law, a Pharisee; with regard to zeal, persecuting the church; as touching the righteousness which is by the law, blameless.
050	PHI	003	007	But what things were gain to me, these have I counted loss for Christ.
050	PHI	003	008	Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the transcendently excellent knowledge of Jesus Christ my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but as offals of ordure, that I may gain Christ,
050	PHI	003	009	and be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is by the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:
050	PHI	003	010	that I may know him, and the virtue of his resurrection, and communion with his sufferings, being conformed to his death;
050	PHI	003	011	if haply I may attain unto the resurrection of the dead.
050	PHI	003	012	Not that I have already attained, or am now perfect: but I pursue, that I may overtake that for which also by his apprehension of me I am destined by Christ Jesus.
050	PHI	003	013	Brethren, I count not myself to have overtaken it; but this one object I pursue, forgetting the things which are behind, and reaching out to those which are before,
050	PHI	003	014	I press towards the mark for the prize of the divine calling from on high in Christ Jesus.
050	PHI	003	015	Let as many of us therefore as are perfect, be thus minded: and if ye entertain any other sentiment, God also will unveil this unto you.
050	PHI	003	016	Nevertheless, so far as we have advanced, be it our care to walk by the same rule, to mind the same thing.
050	PHI	003	017	Be ye imitators, brethren, of me, and eye attentively those who walk so as ye have us for an example.
050	PHI	003	018	For many walk, whom I have often mentioned to you, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:
050	PHI	003	019	whose end is perdition, whose God is their belly, and their glory in their shame, whose minds are occupied with earthly things.
050	PHI	003	020	But our conversation is in heaven as its citizens, from whence also we are expecting the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ,
050	PHI	003	021	who shall transform our body of humiliation, that it may be conformed to his body of glory, according to the effectual working of him who is able to subdue even all things to himself.
050	PHI	004	001	WHEREFORE, my brethren, beloved, and very dear to me, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, O beloved.
050	PHI	004	002	I beseech Euodias, and I beseech Syntiche to be of one mind in the Lord.
050	PHI	004	003	And I beseech thee also, my genuine associate, assist those women who laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and my other fellow-labourers, whose names are in the book of life.
050	PHI	004	004	Rejoice in the Lord always; again I say, Rejoice.
050	PHI	004	005	Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.
050	PHI	004	006	Be not anxious about any thing, but in every case by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your petitions be made known unto God.
050	PHI	004	007	And the peace of God which surpasseth all comprehension, shall guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.
050	PHI	004	008	Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are serious, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are amiable, whatsoever things are laudable, if there be any virtue, or any thing praise-worthy, pay attention to these things.
050	PHI	004	009	Whatsoever things also ye have learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, these practise, and the God of peace shall be with you.
050	PHI	004	010	Now I rejoiced greatly in the Lord, that now once more your thoughtful attention about me hath again sprung up, to which also your mind had been disposed, but ye had not found the opportunity.
050	PHI	004	011	Not that I mention this with a view to my indigence: for I have learned in whatever circumstances I am, to be content.
050	PHI	004	012	I know how to be abased, and I know how to abound; in every state and in all situations I am instructed either to be full or famishing, either to enjoy abundance, or to suffer want:
050	PHI	004	013	I am enabled for all things by Christ who strengtheneth me.
050	PHI	004	014	Nevertheless ye have done nobly in your communications to me during my affliction.
050	PHI	004	015	But know also, Philippians, that at my first preaching the gospel, when I went from Macedonia, no church communicated to me in the way of giving and receiving but ye alone.
050	PHI	004	016	For in Thessalonica also ye sent me once, yea twice, a supply for my want.
050	PHI	004	017	Not that I am anxious for a gift; but I am anxious to see fruit abounding on your account.
050	PHI	004	018	But I have now all things, and abound: I am full, having received from Epaphroditus your bounty, an odour of sweet smell, an acceptable sacrifice, well pleasing to God.
050	PHI	004	019	But my God will fully supply all your want, according to his riches in glory, by Christ Jesus.
050	PHI	004	020	Now to God, even our Father, be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
050	PHI	004	021	Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren that are with me salute you.
050	PHI	004	022	All the saints salute you, specially those who are of Caesar’s household.
050	PHI	004	023	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen. Unto the Philippians, written from Rome by Epaphroditus.

051	COL	001	001	PAUL, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy a brother,
051	COL	001	002	to the saints at Colosse, and to the faithful brethren in Christ: grace be unto you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
051	COL	001	003	We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, always praying for you,
051	COL	001	004	having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and the love ye show to all the saints;
051	COL	001	005	because of the hope laid up for you in the heavens, which ye have heard before in the word of truth, the gospel,
051	COL	001	006	which is come unto you, as it is also unto all the world; and beareth fruit, as also among you, from the day that ye heard and knew the grace of God in truth;
051	COL	001	007	even as ye have learned from Epaphras our beloved fellow-labourer, who is a faithful minister of Christ for you;
051	COL	001	008	who also declared to us your love in the Spirit.
051	COL	001	009	For this cause we also from the day we heard it have not ceased praying for you, and beseeching God that ye may be filled with the knowledge of his will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;
051	COL	001	010	that ye may walk worthy of the Lord, well pleasing him in all things, in every good work fruitful, and increasing in the knowledge of God;
051	COL	001	011	strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and long-suffering with joy;
051	COL	001	012	giving thanks to God, even the Father, who hath made us meet for a portion in the inheritance of the saints in light;
051	COL	001	013	who hath plucked us out from the dominion of darkness, and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of his love:
051	COL	001	014	in whom we have redemption through his blood, and forgiveness of sins.
051	COL	001	015	Who is the image of the invisible God, the prime author of all creation:
051	COL	001	016	for by him were all things created, celestial and terrestrial, visible or invisible, whether thrones, or dominations, or principalities, or powers, all were created by him, and for him:
051	COL	001	017	and he is before all, and by him all things subsist.
051	COL	001	018	And he is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning, the first begotten from the dead, that he might be in all things pre-eminent.
051	COL	001	019	For it hath pleased the Father that in him all fulness should dwell;
051	COL	001	020	and by him to reconcile all things to himself, making peace by the blood of his cross: by him, I say, whether they be things on earth, or things in the heavens.
051	COL	001	021	And you who in time past were all aliens, and enemies in mind by wicked works, hath he now reconciled,
051	COL	001	022	by the body of his flesh, through death, to present you holy, and blameless, and irreprehensible in his presence:
051	COL	001	023	if ye abide in faith grounded and firm, and never moved aside from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which hath been preached to the whole creation which is under heaven, of which I Paul am a minister.
051	COL	001	024	Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up in my flesh the measure of afflictions for Christ which remains to be endured for his body, which is the church,
051	COL	001	025	of which I am a minister, according to the dispensation of God, which was given me for you to fulfil the ministry of the word of God―
051	COL	001	026	the mystery which was hid from ages and from generations, but is now unveiled to his saints;
051	COL	001	027	to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:
051	COL	001	028	whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus;
051	COL	001	029	for which also I am labouring, conflicting in the energy of his might, which worketh in me powerfully.
051	COL	002	001	FOR I wish you to know how great a struggle I sustain for you, and those at Laodicea, and as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;
051	COL	002	002	that their hearts may be comforted, firmly united together in love, and unto all riches of full assurance of understanding, in the knowledge of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;
051	COL	002	003	in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
051	COL	002	004	Now this I say, lest any man pervert you with specious discourse.
051	COL	002	005	For though I am absent from you in person, yet I am present with you in spirit, rejoicing and beholding your regular order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ.
051	COL	002	006	As therefore ye have received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in him:
051	COL	002	007	rooted and built up on him, and confirmed in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.
051	COL	002	008	Beware that no man make a prey of you by means of philosophy and vain delusion, after the tradition of men, after the principles of the world, and not after Christ:
051	COL	002	009	for in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily;
051	COL	002	010	and ye are complete in him, who is the head of all principality and power:
051	COL	002	011	in whom also ye have been circumcised with the circumcision not made with hands, by the putting off the body of the sins of the flesh, through the circumcision of Christ:
051	COL	002	012	buried with him in baptism, in which also ye have been raised up together with him by faith, the energy of God, who raised him from the dead.
051	COL	002	013	And you, who were dead in sins and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened with him, freely forgiving you all trespasses;
051	COL	002	014	and hath blotted out the handwriting in ordinances that was against us, which was the obstacle to us, and took it from the midst, nailing it to the cross;
051	COL	002	015	spoiling principalities and powers, he exposed them to view openly, triumphing over them on it.
051	COL	002	016	Let no man therefore judge you concerning what you eat, or what you drink, or the observance of a feast, or new moon, or the sabbaths;
051	COL	002	017	which are merely shadows of things to come: but the body is Christ’s.
051	COL	002	018	Let no man juggle you out of your prize, voluntary in his humility and the worship of angels, intruding into things which he never saw, vainly puffed up by his carnal imagination;
051	COL	002	019	and not firmly attached to the head, from which the whole body, by joints and ligaments, harmoniously adjusted and closely compacted, increaseth with increase from God.
051	COL	002	020	If then ye have been dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye dogmatically taught,
051	COL	002	021	eat not, nor talk, nor touch,
051	COL	002	022	(all which things tend to corruption by abuse) according to the injunctions and doctrines of men?
051	COL	002	023	Which things indeed hold forth an appearance of wisdom in will-worship, and humility, and bodily mortification, though not of any value, but a gratification to the flesh.
051	COL	003	001	IF ye then be risen with Christ, seek the things which are above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.
051	COL	003	002	Fix your minds on things above, not on things on the earth.
051	COL	003	003	For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.
051	COL	003	004	When Christ shall appear, who is our life, then shall you also with him be manifested in glory.
051	COL	003	005	Mortify therefore your members which are on the earth, fornication, impurity, the vile passion, evil concupiscence, and insatiable desire, which is idolatry:
051	COL	003	006	for which things the wrath of God cometh upon the children of disobedience;
051	COL	003	007	in which ye also walked formerly when ye lived among them:
051	COL	003	008	but now ye have put away all these things, anger, asperity, malice, scandal, obscenity, out of your mouth.
051	COL	003	009	Lie not one to another, seeing ye have put off the old man with his practices;
051	COL	003	010	and have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge, after the image of him that created him.
051	COL	003	011	Where there is no difference whether a man be Greek or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian or Scythian, slave or freeman: but Christ is all and in all.
051	COL	003	012	Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humility, meekness, long-suffering;
051	COL	003	013	forbearing one another, and freely forgiving one another, if any man hath a complaint against another: even as Christ hath freely forgiven you, so also do ye.
051	COL	003	014	But above all these things put on love, which is the bond of perfection.
051	COL	003	015	And let the peace of God set up its throne in your hearts, whereunto also ye have been called in one body; and be ye thankful.
051	COL	003	016	Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing yourselves in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual canticles, singing with grace in your heart unto the Lord.
051	COL	003	017	And everything that ye do in word or in work, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.
051	COL	003	018	Wives be subject to your own husbands, as is fit in the Lord.
051	COL	003	019	Husbands, love your wives, and use no asperity against them.
051	COL	003	020	Children, be obedient to your parents in all things; for this is well-pleasing to the Lord.
051	COL	003	021	Parents, irritate not your children, lest their spirit be broken.
051	COL	003	022	Servants, obey in all things your masters after the flesh, not with eye-service as men-pleasers, but, in simplicity of heart, fearing God.
051	COL	003	023	And in every thing that ye do, labour from the soul, as for the Lord, and not man;
051	COL	003	024	knowing that from the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye are servants to the Lord Christ.
051	COL	003	025	But he that is guilty of injustice shall receive punishment for the wrong he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.
051	COL	004	001	MASTERS, afford to your servants that which is just, and an equivalent, knowing that ye also have a Master in the heavens.
051	COL	004	002	Persevere in prayer, watching therein with thanksgiving;
051	COL	004	003	praying also at the same time for us, that God may open to us a door for the word, that I may speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in chains:
051	COL	004	004	that I may make it evident, as I ought to speak.
051	COL	004	005	Walk wisely with regard to those without, redeeming the time.
051	COL	004	006	Let your discourse be always gracious, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to reply to every man.
051	COL	004	007	All my affairs will Tychicus make known unto you, a beloved brother, and faithful minister, and fellow-servant in the Lord:
051	COL	004	008	whom I have sent unto you for this very purpose, that he might know your affairs, and comfort your hearts;
051	COL	004	009	with Onesimus, that faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you: they will make known unto you all things that have passed here.
051	COL	004	010	There salute you Aristarchus my fellow-prisoner, and Mark nephew to Barnabas, concerning whom ye have received injunctions; if he come unto you, receive him,
051	COL	004	011	and Jesus, who is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only are my fellow-labourers for the kingdom of God, who have been a comfort to me.
051	COL	004	012	Epaphras, one of you, saluteth you, a servant of Christ, always wrestling for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.
051	COL	004	013	For I bear him witness that he hath great zeal for you, and for those in Laodicea, and those in Hierapolis.
051	COL	004	014	Luke, the beloved physician, saluteth you, and Demas.
051	COL	004	015	Salute the brethren that are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is at his house.
051	COL	004	016	And when this epistle hath been read among you, cause that it also be read in the church of the Laodiceans, and that ye also read that from Laodicea.
051	COL	004	017	And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received from the Lord, that thou fulfil it.
051	COL	004	018	The salutation of Paul with mine own hand. Remember my chains. Grace be with you. Amen. Written to the Colossians from Rome by Tychicus and Onesimus.

# BOOK	052	1TH	1 Thessalonians	1 Thessalonians
052	1TH	001	001	PAUL, and Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father, and in the Lord Jesus Christ: grace unto you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
052	1TH	001	002	We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;
052	1TH	001	003	without ceasing calling to mind your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father;
052	1TH	001	004	knowing, brethren, beloved of God, your election.
052	1TH	001	005	For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in great fulness of assurance; as ye know what manner of men we have been among you for your sakes.
052	1TH	001	006	And ye became imitators of us, and of the Lord, receiving the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost;
052	1TH	001	007	so that ye became models for all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.
052	1TH	001	008	For from you sounded forth the word of the Lord, not only into Macedonia and Achaia, but into every region also your fidelity towards God is gone out, so that we have no need to say any thing.
052	1TH	001	009	For they publish concerning you what manner of entrance we had unto you, and how ye turned unto God from idols, to serve the living and true God,
052	1TH	001	010	and to wait for his Son from the heavens, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, who delivereth us from the wrath to come.
052	1TH	002	001	FOR ye yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in to you, that it was not in vain.
052	1TH	002	002	But though we had suffered before, and were infamously treated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to preach unto you the gospel of God amidst a great conflict.
052	1TH	002	003	And our exhortation originated not from delusion, or impurity, or from guile;
052	1TH	002	004	but as we have been approved of God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God, who trieth our hearts.
052	1TH	002	005	For neither at any time used we insinuating language, as ye know, nor a pretext for covetousness; God is witness:
052	1TH	002	006	not seeking glory from men, neither from you, nor from others, though we might have been burdensome, as apostles of Christ.
052	1TH	002	007	But we were gentle in the midst of you, as a nurse cherisheth her own infants.
052	1TH	002	008	So, tenderly affected towards you, we could with pleasure have imparted to you not the gospel of God only, but our own lives also, because ye were beloved by us.
052	1TH	002	009	For ye remember, brethren, our labour and toil: for night and day working hard, that we might be no burden to any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.
052	1TH	002	010	Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily, and justly, and faultlessly we conducted ourselves among you that believe:
052	1TH	002	011	as ye know how we treated every one of you, as a father doth his children, exhorting you, and admonishing, and conjuring you,
052	1TH	002	012	that ye should walk worthy of God, as calling you into his kingdom and glory.
052	1TH	002	013	For this cause do we also give thanks to God unceasingly, because when ye received the word reported by us from God, ye received it not as the word of man, but, as it is in truth, the word of God, which worketh also effectually in you that believe.
052	1TH	002	014	For ye, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea, in Christ Jesus: for ye suffered the same things also yourselves from your own countrymen, as they too have of the Jews;
052	1TH	002	015	who both murdered the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and have persecuted us, and please not God, and are in opposition to all mankind;
052	1TH	002	016	forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles, that they might be saved, to fill up the measure of their iniquities always: but wrath is coming upon them to the extremity.
052	1TH	002	017	But we, brethren, bereaved of you for a short moment, in person, not in heart, have more abundantly longed to see your face with great desire.
052	1TH	002	018	Therefore we wished to have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan prevented us.
052	1TH	002	019	For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?
052	1TH	002	020	For ye are our glory and joy.
052	1TH	003	001	WHEREFORE when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone:
052	1TH	003	002	and sent Timothy our brother, and a minister of God, and our fellow-labourer in the gospel of Christ, that he might stablish you, and comfort you concerning your faith:
052	1TH	003	003	that no man might be shaken by these tribulations; for ye yourselves know that thereunto we are appointed.
052	1TH	003	004	For when we were with you, we told you before that we were about to suffer tribulation; as also it came to pass, and ye know.
052	1TH	003	005	For this cause also, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your fidelity, lest by any means the tempter had tempted you, and our labour should be in vain.
052	1TH	003	006	But now when Timothy returned to us from you, and brought us the glad tidings of your faith and love, and that ye retain a kind remembrance of us always, earnestly desirous to see us, as we are also to see you:
052	1TH	003	007	for this cause we have felt consolation, brethren, in you under all our tribulation and distress, because of your fidelity.
052	1TH	003	008	For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.
052	1TH	003	009	For what sufficient thanks can we render to God for you, for all the joy with which we rejoice on your account before our God,
052	1TH	003	010	night and day most fervently praying that we may see your face, and amply supply the deficiencies of your faith?
052	1TH	003	011	Now God himself, and our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ direct our way unto you.
052	1TH	003	012	And the Lord cause you to abound and overflow with love one to another, and towards all men, as we also do to you:
052	1TH	003	013	to the end that your hearts may be established blameless in holiness before God and our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.
052	1TH	004	001	FINALLY, brethren, we beseech you therefore, and conjure you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk, and please God, so ye would abound more and more.
052	1TH	004	002	For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.
052	1TH	004	003	For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that you should abstain from whoredom;
052	1TH	004	004	that every one of you may know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honour,
052	1TH	004	005	not in the vile passion of lewdness, as the Gentiles which know not God;
052	1TH	004	006	that no man transgress against, or act dishonestly to his brother in this matter because the Lord is the avenger of all such things, as we have told you before, and testified.
052	1TH	004	007	For God hath not called us unto impurity, but unto holiness.
052	1TH	004	008	Therefore he that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his Holy Spirit.
052	1TH	004	009	Now concerning brotherly love, I have no need to write unto you: for ye yourselves are divinely taught to love one another.
052	1TH	004	010	And indeed ye practise it towards all the brethren that are throughout Macedonia: but we conjure you, brethren, to abound more and more;
052	1TH	004	011	and that you make it your study to live peaceably, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, even as we have enjoined you;
052	1TH	004	012	that ye walk becomingly towards those without, and need no assistance from any person.
052	1TH	004	013	Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning those who are fallen asleep, that ye be not afflicted, as the rest of mankind who have no hope.
052	1TH	004	014	For if we believe that Jesus died, and rose again, so also those that have fallen asleep for Jesus shall God bring with him.
052	1TH	004	015	For this I say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left unto the coming of the Lord, shall not prevent those who are fallen asleep.
052	1TH	004	016	For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise first:
052	1TH	004	017	then we who are alive, who remain, shall be caught up together with them into the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and so shall we be ever with the Lord.
052	1TH	004	018	Wherefore comfort one another with these words.
052	1TH	005	001	NOW concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I should write to you:
052	1TH	005	002	for yourselves know precisely that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.
052	1TH	005	003	For when they say, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction rusheth upon them, as travail on a woman with child, and they shall in no wise escape.
052	1TH	005	004	But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that the day should overtake you as a thief.
052	1TH	005	005	Ye are all the children of light, and the children of day: we are not the children of night, nor of darkness.
052	1TH	005	006	Let us not then sleep as do others; but let us watch and be sober.
052	1TH	005	007	For they who sleep, sleep in the night, and they who are drunken, are drunken in the night;
052	1TH	005	008	but let us who are of the day be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet the hope of salvation.
052	1TH	005	009	For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
052	1TH	005	010	who died for us, that whether we sleep, or whether we wake, we may live together with him.
052	1TH	005	011	Wherefore comfort one another, and edify one another, as also ye do.
052	1TH	005	012	Now we entreat you, brethren, to know those who labour among you, and preside over you in the Lord, and admonish you;
052	1TH	005	013	and to account of them very highly in love for their work’s sake. And live in peace among yourselves.
052	1TH	005	014	Now we conjure you, brethren, admonish the unruly, comfort the feeble-minded, support the infirm, be patient with all men.
052	1TH	005	015	See that no man return evil for evil to any man; but always pursue that which is good, both towards one another, and towards all men.
052	1TH	005	016	Rejoice evermore.
052	1TH	005	017	Pray without ceasing.
052	1TH	005	018	In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus to you-wards.
052	1TH	005	019	Quench not the Spirit.
052	1TH	005	020	Despise not prophesyings.
052	1TH	005	021	Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.
052	1TH	005	022	Abstain from all appearance of evil.
052	1TH	005	023	Now the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly; and may your whole spirit, and soul, and body be preserved faultless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
052	1TH	005	024	Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.
052	1TH	005	025	Brethren, pray for us.
052	1TH	005	026	Salute all the brethren with an holy kiss.
052	1TH	005	027	I conjure you by the Lord, that this epistle be read to all the holy brethren.
052	1TH	005	028	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen. The first epistle to the Thessalonians was written from Athens.

# BOOK	053	2TH	2 Thessalonians	2 Thessalonians
053	2TH	001	001	PAUL, and Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ:
053	2TH	001	002	grace unto you and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
053	2TH	001	003	We are bound to give thanks to God always for you, brethren, as it is fit, because your faith groweth exceedingly, and the love of every one of you all towards each other aboundeth:
053	2TH	001	004	so that we ourselves make our boast of you among the churches of God, for your patience and fidelity under all your persecutions and afflictions which ye endure:
053	2TH	001	005	which is a manifest proof of the righteous judgment of God, that ye should be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:
053	2TH	001	006	seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;
053	2TH	001	007	and to you who are troubled, rest with us, at the revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ from heaven with his mighty angels,
053	2TH	001	008	in a flame of fire, taking vengeance of them that know not God, and obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:
053	2TH	001	009	who shall receive punishment, even eternal perdition, from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power:
053	2TH	001	010	when he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired by all those who believe; because our testimony was believed among you in that day.
053	2TH	001	011	Wherefore also we pray continually for you, that our God would count you worthy of the calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power:
053	2TH	001	012	that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified by you, and you by him, according to the grace of our God and Lord, Jesus Christ.
053	2TH	002	001	NOW we entreat you, brethren, with regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together unto him:
053	2TH	002	002	that ye be not hastily agitated with apprehension, nor troubled, neither by spirit, nor by discourse, nor by letter, as coming from us, as though the day of the Lord was instantly approaching.
053	2TH	002	003	Let no man deceive you in any way: because that cannot be till the apostasy come first, and the man of sin appear, the son of perdition,
053	2TH	002	004	who opposeth himself against, and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or is the object of adoration; so that he in the temple of God sitteth as God, exhibiting himself in public that he is God.
053	2TH	002	005	Do ye not remember that when I was yet with you, I told you these things?
053	2TH	002	006	And now ye know what withholdeth, that he may be revealed in his own time.
053	2TH	002	007	For the mystery of iniquity is already powerfully working; only he that withholdeth hitherto, will do so till he is removed.
053	2TH	002	008	And then that lawless person will appear, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming;
053	2TH	002	009	whose appearing is known by fanatical energy, displayed in all power, and signs, and lying miracles,
053	2TH	002	010	and in every unrighteous delusion among those who perish: in consequence of which things they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.
053	2TH	002	011	And for this cause God shall send unto them the energy of delusion, that they should believe a lie:
053	2TH	002	012	that they all might be damned who have not believed the truth, but have taken pleasure in unrighteousness.
053	2TH	002	013	But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brethren, beloved of the Lord, because God hath elected you from the beginning unto salvation, by sanctification of the Spirit, and faith in the truth:
053	2TH	002	014	whereunto also he called you by our gospel, in order to your acquisition of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
053	2TH	002	015	Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and firmly hold the injunctions delivered to you, as ye have been taught, whether by our discourse, or by letter.
053	2TH	002	016	Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and our God, and Father, who hath loved us, and given us everlasting consolation, and good hope through grace,
053	2TH	002	017	comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work.
053	2TH	003	001	FINALLY, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run, and be glorified, even as among you;
053	2TH	003	002	and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for there is not faith in all.
053	2TH	003	003	But the Lord is faithful, who will stablish you, and keep you from the wicked one.
053	2TH	003	004	But we have confidence in the Lord towards you, that the things which we have enjoined you, ye both do, and will do.
053	2TH	003	005	And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patience of Christ.
053	2TH	003	006	Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to withdraw yourselves from every brother who walketh disorderly, and not according to the injunction which he hath received from us.
053	2TH	003	007	For ye yourselves know how ye ought to imitate us; for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you,
053	2TH	003	008	neither did we eat bread with any man unpaid for, but with labour and toil worked night and day, that we might be burdensome to none of you:
053	2TH	003	009	not that we have not such power, but that we might be ourselves an example for you to imitate.
053	2TH	003	010	For when we were with you, this we enjoined you, that if a man would not work, neither should he eat.
053	2TH	003	011	For we hear that there are some among you who walk disorderly, doing no work, but being busy-bodies.
053	2TH	003	012	Now such we command, and conjure, by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they labour, and eat their own bread.
053	2TH	003	013	But ye, brethren, be not weary of well doing.
053	2TH	003	014	And if any man obey not our word by letter, mark that man, and maintain no society with him, that he may be ashamed.
053	2TH	003	015	Yet regard him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.
053	2TH	003	016	And the Lord of peace himself give you peace, by every means, in every situation. The Lord be with you all.
053	2TH	003	017	The salutation of Paul with my own hand, which is my sign in every letter: so I write.
053	2TH	003	018	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen. The second epistle was written to the Thessalonians from Athens.

# BOOK	054	1TI	1 Timothy	1 Timothy
054	1TI	001	001	PAUL, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the order of God, our Saviour, and Lord, Jesus Christ, who is our hope;
054	1TI	001	002	to Timothy, my genuine son in faith: grace, mercy, and peace from God our Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord.
054	1TI	001	003	As I exhorted thee to abide at Ephesus when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest enjoin certain persons to introduce no different doctrine,
054	1TI	001	004	nor to attend to fables and endless genealogies, which give occasion to disputes rather than godly edification, which is by faith; so do.
054	1TI	001	005	For the end of the commandment is love out of a clean heart, and good conscience, and faith unfeigned:
054	1TI	001	006	from which some, having swerved, have turned aside to vain babbling;
054	1TI	001	007	affecting to be doctors of the law, though they underhand neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.
054	1TI	001	008	But we know that the law is good if a man use it according to its institution;
054	1TI	001	009	knowing this, that the law is not made for the just man, but for the lawless and disorderly, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for men-slayers,
054	1TI	001	010	for whoremongers, for sodomites, for stealers of men, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing which is contrary to sound doctrine,
054	1TI	001	011	according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, with which I have been put in trust.
054	1TI	001	012	And I render thanks to him who hath strengthened me, even to Christ Jesus our Lord, that he hath counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;
054	1TI	001	013	who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and insolently violent, But I was admitted to mercy, for I did it ignorantly in unbelief;
054	1TI	001	014	but the grace of our Lord hath exceedingly abounded with faith and love, which is in Christ Jesus.
054	1TI	001	015	It is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the chief.
054	1TI	001	016	But for this end obtained I mercy, that in me, the chief, Jesus Christ might shew forth all long-suffering, for a pattern to those who should after believe in him unto eternal life.
054	1TI	001	017	Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.
054	1TI	001	018	This commandment, son Timothy, I give thee, according to the prophecies which were before delivered concerning thee, that by them thou mightest war a good warfare;
054	1TI	001	019	holding faith and a good conscience, which some having renounced, as touching the faith, have been shipwrecked:
054	1TI	001	020	of whom are Hymeneus and Alexander, whom I have delivered over unto Satan, that they may be corrected, so as to blaspheme no more.
054	1TI	002	001	I EXHORT therefore, first of all, that there be offered supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings for the whole race of mankind:
054	1TI	002	002	for kings, and all that are in a state of eminence, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and seriousness.
054	1TI	002	003	For this is becoming, and acceptable before God our Saviour;
054	1TI	002	004	who wills all men to be saved, and come to the acknowledgment of truth.
054	1TI	002	005	For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;
054	1TI	002	006	who gave himself a ransom for all, the testimony to be born in his appointed times;
054	1TI	002	007	of which I am ordained a preacher and apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, I lie not, ) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
054	1TI	002	008	I will then that men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands without wrath or doubting:
054	1TI	002	009	in like manner also that the women dress themselves in decent apparel, with modesty and sobriety; not with plaited tresses, or gold, or pearls, or very costly clothing,
054	1TI	002	010	but as becometh women professing godliness, with good works.
054	1TI	002	011	Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection:
054	1TI	002	012	for I permit not a woman to teach in public, or to assume authority over the man, but to abide in silence.
054	1TI	002	013	For Adam was first formed, Eve afterwards.
054	1TI	002	014	And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived, by transgression fell.
054	1TI	002	015	But she shall be saved through childbearing, if they abide in faith, and love, and holiness with sobriety.
054	1TI	003	001	IT is a true saying, If a man seeks the office of a bishop, he desireth a laudable employment.
054	1TI	003	002	A bishop then must be irreprehensible, the husband of one wife, temperate, sagacious, respectable, hospitable, well qualified for teaching;
054	1TI	003	003	not addicted to wine, not using hard words or blows, not greedy of base gain; but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money;
054	1TI	003	004	presiding over his own family with propriety, having his children under subjection with all gravity of behaviour:
054	1TI	003	005	for if a man knoweth not how to order his own family, how shall he take proper care of the church of God?
054	1TI	003	006	Not a new convert, lest he be puffed up, and fall into the devil’s crime.
054	1TI	003	007	He must also have a fair character from those who are without, that he may not fall into reproach, and into the snare of the devil.
054	1TI	003	008	The deacons also in like manner must be grave, not doubletongued, not addicting themselves to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;
054	1TI	003	009	holding the mystery of the faith with a pure conscience.
054	1TI	003	010	And let these also be first proved, and if found blameless, then let them enter on the deacon’s office.
054	1TI	003	011	Their wives in like manner must be grave women, not addicted to scandal, sober, faithful in all things.
054	1TI	003	012	Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ordering well their children and their own families.
054	1TI	003	013	For they who discharge the office of a deacon with propriety, acquire to themselves a respectable station in the church, and great boldness in the faith which is in Jesus Christ.
054	1TI	003	014	These things I write to thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly:
054	1TI	003	015	but should I be delayed, that thou mayest know how it behoveth thee to conduct thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and the pedestal of truth.
054	1TI	003	016	And confessedly great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifested in the flesh, justified by the Spirit, seen of angels, preached among the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.
054	1TI	004	001	NOW the Spirit speaketh expresly, that in the latter days some will apostatise from the faith, giving heed to spirits of delusion, and doctrines of devils;
054	1TI	004	002	men who teach lies with hypocrisy; and have their own consciences cauterised;
054	1TI	004	003	prohibiting marriage, and enjoining abstinence from particular meats, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by the faithful, and those who acknowledge the truth.
054	1TI	004	004	For every creature of God is good, and none to be rejected, if used with thanksgiving:
054	1TI	004	005	for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.
054	1TI	004	006	If thou suggest these truths to the brethren, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and sound doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.
054	1TI	004	007	But profane and antiquated fables reject, but exercise thyself unto godliness.
054	1TI	004	008	For bodily exercise is of little advantage, but godliness is profitable for all things, having the promise of the life which now is, and of that which is to come.
054	1TI	004	009	This is a faithful saying, and deserving all acceptance.
054	1TI	004	010	For therefore do we labour and are exposed to abuse, because we have hoped in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, especially of the faithful.
054	1TI	004	011	Announce and teach these things.
054	1TI	004	012	Let no man despise thy youth; but be a pattern of the faithful, in discourse; in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity.
054	1TI	004	013	Till I come, apply to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.
054	1TI	004	014	Neglect not the gift which is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with imposition of the hands of the presbytery.
054	1TI	004	015	Let these things be thy care; be wholly devoted to them; that thy progress may be evident to all men.
054	1TI	004	016	Take heed unto thyself, and to thy doctrine; abide in them: for so doing thou shalt both save thyself, and those who hear thee.
054	1TI	005	001	REBUKE not harshly an aged man, but admonish him as a father; the younger men as brethren;
054	1TI	005	002	the aged women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.
054	1TI	005	003	Honour the widows, that are widows indeed.
054	1TI	005	004	But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them learn as their first duty to shew their piety towards their own family, and make a grateful return to their progenitors: for this is becoming and acceptable before God.
054	1TI	005	005	But she who is a widow indeed, and abandoned to solitude, hopeth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.
054	1TI	005	006	But she who lives voluptuously is dead, though she liveth.
054	1TI	005	007	And these things inculcate, that they may be blameless.
054	1TI	005	008	But if any man provide not for his own relations, and especially for those more immediately of his own family, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.
054	1TI	005	009	Let no widow be put on the list under sixty years of age, who hath been the wife of one husband,
054	1TI	005	010	bringing attestation of her good works; that she hath well educated her children, that she hath been hospitable to strangers, that she hath washed the saints feet, that she hath assisted the afflicted, that she hath followed diligently every good work.
054	1TI	005	011	But the younger widows reject: for when they give themselves to wantonness contrary to Christ, they will marry;
054	1TI	005	012	incurring censure, for having violated their former engagement.
054	1TI	005	013	And at the same time also they learn to be idle, visiting about in the houses; and not merely idle, but talkative and inquisitive, speaking things they ought not.
054	1TI	005	014	I would therefore have the younger widows to marry, bear children, govern their house, give no occasion to the adversary to bring a reproach on them.
054	1TI	005	015	For some are already turned aside after Satan.
054	1TI	005	016	But if any man or woman who believes hath widows their relations, let him provide for them, and let not the church be burdened; that there may be a sufficiency for the real widows.
054	1TI	005	017	Let the elders who preside properly be counted worthy of double honour, especially those who are laborious in preaching and teaching.
054	1TI	005	018	For the Scripture saith, “Thou shalt not muzzle the ox while he treadeth out the corn.” And again, “The labourer is worthy of his hire.”
054	1TI	005	019	Against a presbyter receive not an accusation, except it be from two or three witnesses.
054	1TI	005	020	Those who sin rebuke before all, that the rest also may tremble.
054	1TI	005	021	I adjure thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality.
054	1TI	005	022	Lay hands hastily on no man, nor share another’s sins: keep thyself pure;
054	1TI	005	023	confine thyself no longer to water-drinking; but use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake, and thy frequent indispositions.
054	1TI	005	024	Some men’s sins are glaringly manifest, going before to judgment; and after others also they follow to detection.
054	1TI	005	025	In like manner also the good works of some are previously manifest; and it is not possible that what they have besides should be concealed.
054	1TI	006	001	LET as many slaves as are under the yoke account their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and the doctrine be not blasphemed.
054	1TI	006	002	But they who have believing masters, let them not think less of them, because they are brethren; but serve them the rather, because they are faithful and beloved, who have equally partaken of the benefit. These things teach and enjoin.
054	1TI	006	003	If any man teach another doctrine, and attend not to the sound words, which are those of Jesus Christ our Lord, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;
054	1TI	006	004	he is conceited, knowing nothing, but delirious with disputes and quarrels about words, from whence come wrath, contentions, evil speakings, wrong suspicions,
054	1TI	006	005	perverse wranglings of men corrupt in mind, and destitute of truth, who think to make gain of godliness; depart from such men.
054	1TI	006	006	But godliness with contentment is great gain.
054	1TI	006	007	For that we brought nothing into the world is evident, neither can we carry any thing out of it.
054	1TI	006	008	Having then food and raiment, let us be therewith content.
054	1TI	006	009	For they who will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful passions, which sink men in the abyss of destruction and perdition.
054	1TI	006	010	For the love of money is the root of all evils, which some coveting, have wandered away from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.
054	1TI	006	011	But thou, O man of God, flee from these things; but pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.
054	1TI	006	012	Strain every nerve in the noble conflict of faith, lay fast hold on eternal life, unto which also thou hast been called, and hast confessed the good confession before many witnesses.
054	1TI	006	013	I conjure thee in the presence of God, who giveth life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who witnessed that noble confession before Pontius Pilate;
054	1TI	006	014	that thou observe this injunction spotless, irreproachable, unto the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:
054	1TI	006	015	which in his own appointed times he will shew forth, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;
054	1TI	006	016	who alone possesseth immortality, inhabiting light inaccessible, whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and glory eternal. Amen.
054	1TI	006	017	Charge the rich in this world not to be lifted up with pride, nor to trust on the stability of wealth, but on the living God, who giveth us richly all things for our enjoyment;
054	1TI	006	018	to do good, to be rich in generous actions, to take pleasure in liberality, ready to distribute;
054	1TI	006	019	laying up treasure for themselves a noble foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.
054	1TI	006	020	O Timothy, guard the sacred deposit, avoiding profane trifling talk, and antitheses of misnamed science:
054	1TI	006	021	which some affecting have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with thee.―Amen. The first epistle was written from Laodicea, which is the metropolis of Phrygia Pacatiana.

# BOOK	055	2TI	2 Timothy	2 Timothy
055	2TI	001	001	PAUL, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus,
055	2TI	001	002	to Timothy, my beloved son: grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
055	2TI	001	003	I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with a pure conscience, that I keep up a constant remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;
055	2TI	001	004	earnestly desiring to see thee, remembering thy tears, that I might be filled with joy;
055	2TI	001	005	recalling to my memory the unfeigned faith which was in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and in thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that it is in thee also.
055	2TI	001	006	For which cause I remind thee that thou fan into a flame the divine gift, which is in thee by the imposition of my hands.
055	2TI	001	007	For God hath not given us a spirit of fear; but of courage, and of love, and of sobriety.
055	2TI	001	008	Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but suffer affliction with me in the gospel, supported by the power of God;
055	2TI	001	009	who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before time had a beginning;
055	2TI	001	010	but is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and brought to light life and immortality by the gospel:
055	2TI	001	011	whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.
055	2TI	001	012	For which cause also I suffer these things; but I am not ashamed: for I know on whom I have placed my confidence, and am persuaded that he is mighty to guard my deposit unto the great day.
055	2TI	001	013	Model thy teaching according to the pattern of the sound discourses, which thou hast heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
055	2TI	001	014	The glorious deposit committed to thy trust, guard by the Holy Ghost who dwelleth in us.
055	2TI	001	015	Knowest thou this, that all those of Asia have deserted me? among whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.
055	2TI	001	016	The Lord grant mercy unto the household of Onesiphorus because he frequently was a refreshment to my soul, and was not ashamed of my chain:
055	2TI	001	017	but, when he was at Rome, he sought me out diligently, and found me.
055	2TI	001	018	The Lord grant that he may find mercy with the Lord in the great day; and how liberally he ministered to me at Ephesus, thou knowest better than any other person.
055	2TI	002	001	THOU therefore, my son, be mighty in the grace which is in Jesus Christ.
055	2TI	002	002	And the things which thou hast heard of me before many witnesses, these commit to faithful men, who shall be qualified to teach others also.
055	2TI	002	003	Thou therefore endure hardships, as a brave soldier of Jesus Christ.
055	2TI	002	004	No man who enters the army involves himself with secular affairs; that he may please the person who hath enlisted him.
055	2TI	002	005	And if a man contend in the public games, he is not crowned victor, unless he contend according to the laws.
055	2TI	002	006	The husbandman who toils is the first who ought to partake of the fruits.
055	2TI	002	007	Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.
055	2TI	002	008	Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead, according to my gospel:
055	2TI	002	009	for which I suffer affliction, even unto chains as a malefactor; but the word of God is not bound.
055	2TI	002	010	Therefore I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Jesus Christ with eternal glory.
055	2TI	002	011	It is a faithful saying: for if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:
055	2TI	002	012	if we suffer with him, we shall also reign with him: if we renounce him, he also will renounce us:
055	2TI	002	013	if we are unbelieving, he abideth faithful; he cannot contradict himself.
055	2TI	002	014	Put them in mind of these things, adjuring them before the Lord not to quarrel about words of no use, but tending to the perversion of the audience.
055	2TI	002	015	Be diligent to present thyself before God approved, a workman that need not blush, rightly dividing the word of truth.
055	2TI	002	016	But profane vain bablings avoid: for they will proceed to greater lengths of impiety.
055	2TI	002	017	And their discourse will eat like as a gangrene; of whom are Hymeneus and Philetus;
055	2TI	002	018	who with respect to the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection hath been already; and pervert the faith of some.
055	2TI	002	019	Nevertheless the stable foundation of God standeth firm, having this seal, the Lord knoweth those who belong to him. And, let every man who mentions the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.
055	2TI	002	020	But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and pottery; and some for an honourable use, and others for baser service.
055	2TI	002	021	If therefore a man preserve himself pure from these things, he shall be a vessel for honour, sanctified and highly useful to the master, ready for every good work.
055	2TI	002	022	But flee youthful passions, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those who call upon the Lord out of a pure heart.
055	2TI	002	023	But foolish and uninstructive disputes avoid, knowing that they produce quarrels.
055	2TI	002	024	And a servant of the Lord ought not to quarrel; but to be gentle to all men, apt to teach, forbearing,
055	2TI	002	025	with meekness correcting those who are opposers, if at last God may give unto them repentance so as to submit to the conviction of the truth;
055	2TI	002	026	and that they may escape out of the snare of the devil, who have been captured by him for his will.
055	2TI	003	001	BUT this know, that in the last days distressing times will come.
055	2TI	003	002	For men will be self-lovers, money-lovers, boasters, vainglorious, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
055	2TI	003	003	unnatural, implacable, slanderers, intemperate, inhuman, averse to goodness,
055	2TI	003	004	treacherous, wilful, puffed up with pride, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God;
055	2TI	003	005	holding the form of godliness, but denying the power of it: from these men turn with aversion.
055	2TI	003	006	For such are they who insinuate themselves into houses, and captivate weak women laden with accumulated sins, and actuated by a variety of passions,
055	2TI	003	007	always learning, yet never able to attain unto the knowledge of truth.
055	2TI	003	008	But in the same manner as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these also set themselves in opposition to the truth; men corrupt in mind, reprobate respecting the faith.
055	2TI	003	009	But they shall not proceed to the uttermost; for their infatuation shall be evident to all men, as theirs also was.
055	2TI	003	010	But thou hast fully known my doctrine, conduct, purpose, faith, long-suffering, love, patience,
055	2TI	003	011	the persecutions, the sufferings, which beset me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured, yet out of them all the Lord delivered me.
055	2TI	003	012	And all indeed who will live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.
055	2TI	003	013	But wicked men and impostors will proceed from bad to worse, deceiving and deceived.
055	2TI	003	014	But abide thou in the things which thou hast learned and believed, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;
055	2TI	003	015	and that from a child thou hast known the sacred writings, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Jesus Christ.
055	2TI	003	016	All scripture is given by the inspiration of God, and advantageous for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness
055	2TI	003	017	that the man of God may be properly furnished, fully qualified for every good work.
055	2TI	004	001	I ADJURE thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;
055	2TI	004	002	preach the word, be urgent, in season, out of season; reprove, enjoin, exhort with all long suffering and doctrine.
055	2TI	004	003	For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own inclinations will set up a herd of teachers for themselves, having the itch of hearing;
055	2TI	004	004	and will turn away their ears from the truth, and listen unto fables.
055	2TI	004	005	But watch thou in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fully discharge thy ministry.
055	2TI	004	006	For I am now ready to be sacrificed, and the time of my dissolution approaches.
055	2TI	004	007	I have struggled hard in the honourable contest, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith:
055	2TI	004	008	henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give me at that day: yet not to me only, but also to all who have loved his appearing.
055	2TI	004	009	Hasten to come to me shortly:
055	2TI	004	010	for Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is gone unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia; Titus to Dalmatia.
055	2TI	004	011	Luke alone is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee; for he is very useful to me in the ministry.
055	2TI	004	012	But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.
055	2TI	004	013	The cloke which I left behind me at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest bring, and the books, especially the parchments.
055	2TI	004	014	Alexander the brazier did me many ill offices: the Lord repay him according to his works:
055	2TI	004	015	against whom be thou also on thy guard, for he hath greatly resisted our words.
055	2TI	004	016	At my first apology no man stood by me, but all forsook me: (may it not be imputed to them!)
055	2TI	004	017	but the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that by me the preaching might be fully discharged, and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was snatched out of the lion’s mouth.
055	2TI	004	018	And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and preserve me for his celestial kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
055	2TI	004	019	Salute Priscilla and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.
055	2TI	004	020	Erastus hath abode at Corinth: but Trophimus I left behind me at Miletum sick.
055	2TI	004	021	Hasten to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.
055	2TI	004	022	The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen. The second epistle to Timothy, appointed the first bishop of the Ephesian church, was written from Rome, when the second time Paul stood before the Caesar Nero.

# BOOK	056	TIT	Titus	Titus
056	TIT	001	001	PAUL, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of the elect of God, and the knowledge of truth which leads to godliness;
056	TIT	001	002	in hope of life eternal, which God, who cannot lie, hath promised before time had a being;
056	TIT	001	003	but hath manifested in his own appointed season his word by the preaching, with which I have been entrusted, according to the command of our Saviour God;
056	TIT	001	004	to Titus, my genuine son after the common faith, be grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.
056	TIT	001	005	For this purpose I left thee behind me at Crete, that thou mightest direct the regulations which remained to be executed, and that thou shouldest appoint presbyters in every city, as I charged thee to do:
056	TIT	001	006	if there be a man blameless, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, not under an accusation or debauchery, or disorderly conduct.
056	TIT	001	007	For a bishop ought to be irreproachable, as the steward of God; not self-willed, not irritable, not addicted to wine, not quarrelsome, not greedy of filthy lucre;
056	TIT	001	008	but the stranger’s host, the good man’s friend, grave, just, holy, temperate;
056	TIT	001	009	firmly attached to the faithful word, according to the doctrine delivered, that he may be able to exhort with sound instruction and to confute the opposers.
056	TIT	001	010	For there are many disorderly persons vainly talkative, and under a spirit of delusion, especially some of the circumcised;
056	TIT	001	011	whose mouths ought to be muzzled, who pervert whole families, teaching things which they ought not, for the sake of base gain.
056	TIT	001	012	One of them, a poet of their own nation, hath said, The Cretans are always liars, wicked beasts, slothful gluttons.
056	TIT	001	013	This testimony is true. For which cause rebuke them with severity, that they may be sound in the faith;
056	TIT	001	014	not attending to Jewish fables, and injunctions of men, who have turned away from the truth.
056	TIT	001	015	All things indeed are clean to the clean: but to the defiled and to the unbelievers there is nothing clean; but their very mind and conscience are defiled.
056	TIT	001	016	They profess to know God; but in works deny him, being abominable and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.
056	TIT	002	001	BUT speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:
056	TIT	002	002	that the elder men be sober, grave, discreet, sound in faith, in love, in patience.
056	TIT	002	003	That the elder women also be sacredly becoming in their behaviour, not slanderers, not enslaved by much wine, teachers of propriety;
056	TIT	002	004	that they instruct the young women to be discreet, to love their husbands, to love their children,
056	TIT	002	005	to be sober, domestic, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not ill reported of.
056	TIT	002	006	The younger men in like manner exhort to be sober minded.
056	TIT	002	007	In all things approving thyself as a pattern of good works: in thy teaching, shewing integrity, gravity, incorruptibility,
056	TIT	002	008	sound discourse, incapable of confutation; that he who is in opposition may be confounded, having nothing faulty to say of you.
056	TIT	002	009	Let servants be subject to their own masters, in all things to be agreeable to them; not contradicting;
056	TIT	002	010	not embezzling their property, but demonstrating all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.
056	TIT	002	011	For the grace of God which leads to salvation hath appeared unto all men,
056	TIT	002	012	instructing us, that denying ungodliness and worldly affections, we should live soberly and righteously, and godly in the present day;
056	TIT	002	013	expecting the blessed hope, and glorious appearing of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ;
056	TIT	002	014	who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.
056	TIT	002	015	These things speak and enjoin, and reprove with all authority. Let no man despise thee.
056	TIT	003	001	REMIND them to be subject to princes and those invested with authority, to obey magistrates, to be ready for every good work,
056	TIT	003	002	to slander no man, to be inoffensive, gentle, shewing all meekness to all men.
056	TIT	003	003	For we ourselves also in time past were thoughtless, disobedient, erroneous, enslaved by various passions and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.
056	TIT	003	004	But even then the kindness and love of God our Saviour to man shone forth,
056	TIT	003	005	not for works of righteousness which we had done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the laver of regeneration, and by renovation of the Holy Spirit;
056	TIT	003	006	which he poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;
056	TIT	003	007	that justified by his grace, we might become heirs in hope of eternal life.
056	TIT	003	008	Faithful is the saying, and of these things I wish thee firmly to testify, that they who have believed in God be careful to be pre-eminent in good works. These are becoming and advantageous to men.
056	TIT	003	009	But foolish disquisitions, and genealogies, and disputes, and contentions about the law avoid; for they are unprofitable and vain.
056	TIT	003	010	An heretical person after a first and second admonition reject;
056	TIT	003	011	knowing that such a one is perverted, and sinneth, being self-condemned.
056	TIT	003	012	When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, hasten to come to me unto Nicopolis: for there I have determined to pass the winter.
056	TIT	003	013	Send forward diligently Zenas the lawyer and Apollos, that nothing may be wanting for them.
056	TIT	003	014	And let those who belong to us learn also to be pre-eminent in good works for all necessary calls, that they be not without fruits.
056	TIT	003	015	All that are with me salute thee. Salute those who love us with fidelity. Grace be with you all. Amen. This epistle was written to Titus appointed by suffrage first bishop of the church of Crete, from Nicopolis in Macedonia.

057	PHM	001	001	PAUL, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy a brother, to Philemon the beloved, and our fellow-labourer,
057	PHM	001	002	and to Apphia the beloved, and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the church at thy house:
057	PHM	001	003	grace be to you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
057	PHM	001	004	I thank my God always, making mention of thee in my prayers,
057	PHM	001	005	hearing of thy love and faith which thou hast towards the Lord Jesus, and unto all the saints;
057	PHM	001	006	that there may be an operative communication of thy faith made known by every good thing, which is in you towards Jesus Christ.
057	PHM	001	007	For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints have been refreshed by thee, brother.
057	PHM	001	008	Wherefore, though I have in Christ great liberty to enjoin thee what is becoming,
057	PHM	001	009	I rather for love’s sake entreat, being such as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner for Jesus Christ.
057	PHM	001	010	I entreat thee for my son, whom I have begotten during my bonds, Onesimus:
057	PHM	001	011	who in time past hath been an unprofitable servant to thee, but now very profitable to thee and to me:
057	PHM	001	012	whom I have sent back; thou therefore receive him, even as my own bowels:
057	PHM	001	013	whom I wished to detain about myself, that in thy stead he might have waited upon me during my bonds for the gospel:
057	PHM	001	014	but without thy consent would I do nothing; that this good deed of thine might not be as of necessity, but from thy own choice.
057	PHM	001	015	For to this end perhaps was he separated from thee for a season, that thou mightest receive him for ever;
057	PHM	001	016	no longer as a slave, but above a slave, as a brother beloved, especially by me, but how much more by thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?
057	PHM	001	017	If therefore thou holdest me a sharer with thee, receive him as myself.
057	PHM	001	018	If he hath injured thee or oweth thee ought, put that to my account;
057	PHM	001	019	I Paul have given it under my own hand, I will repay it, not to say to thee, that thou owest even thine own self unto me.
057	PHM	001	020	Yea, brother, I wish to have joy in thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.
057	PHM	001	021	Having confidence in thy obedience, I have written unto thee, knowing that thou wilt do more than I say.
057	PHM	001	022	But at the same time prepare me also a lodging: for I hope that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.
057	PHM	001	023	There salute thee Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus;
057	PHM	001	024	Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow-labourers.
057	PHM	001	025	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Amen. Written to Philemon from Rome, by Onesimus one of his household.

# BOOK	058	HEB	Hebrews	Hebrews
058	HEB	001	001	GOD, who spake to the fathers of old at various times, and in different manners by the prophets,
058	HEB	001	002	in these last days hath spoken to us by a Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;
058	HEB	001	003	who being the splendour of his glory, and the very impress of his substance, and upholding all things with his powerful word, by himself having effected the cleansing of our sins, he sat down at the right hand of Majesty on high;
058	HEB	001	004	made as much superior to the angels, as he hath inherited a more distinguished name than they.
058	HEB	001	005	For to which of the angels ever said he, “My Son art thou, I have to-day begotten thee?” And again, “I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?”
058	HEB	001	006	And again, when he introduces the first-begotten into the world, he saith, “Let all the angels of God also worship him.”
058	HEB	001	007	And concerning the angels indeed he thus speaks: “Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministering servants a flame of fire.”
058	HEB	001	008	But to the Son, “Thy throne, O God, is unto eternity; a sceptre of rectitude is the sceptre of thy kingdom.
058	HEB	001	009	Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of exultation above those who partake with thee.”
058	HEB	001	010	“And thou from the beginning, O Lord, hast founded the earth, and the heavens are the works of thine hands.
058	HEB	001	011	They will be destroyed, but thou remainest; and they all will grow old as a garment,
058	HEB	001	012	and as a cloak thou wilt wrap them up, and they will undergo a change: but thou art the same, and thy years will never end.”
058	HEB	001	013	Unto which indeed of the angels said he ever, “Sit at my right hand until I put thine enemies for a footstool of thy feet?”
058	HEB	001	014	Are they not all ministerial spirits, sent to perform service on account of those who are about to inherit salvation?
058	HEB	002	001	FOR this reason we ought to attend more diligently to the things which have been heard, lest by any means we let them flow by us.
058	HEB	002	002	For if the discourse spoken by angels was confirmed, and every transgression and disobedience received a just punishment as its due,
058	HEB	002	003	how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation, which, commencing at the beginning to be spoken by the Lord, was confirmed unto us by those who had heard him;
058	HEB	002	004	God superadding his testimony with them, by signs, and wonders, and various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?
058	HEB	002	005	For he hath not subjected the future world, of which we are speaking, to the angels.
058	HEB	002	006	But one in a certain passage testifieth, saying, “What is man, that thou rememberest him, or a son of man, that thou regardest him?”
058	HEB	002	007	“Thou hast made him for a little while lower than angels, thou hast crowned him with glory and honour, and hast placed him over the works of thy hands:
058	HEB	002	008	thou hast subjected all things under his feet.” Now in subjecting all things to him, he left nothing unsubjected to him; but at present we see not yet all things subjected to him.
058	HEB	002	009	But we see Jesus for a little while made lower than angels, by the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour, that, by the grace of God, he might taste of death for every one.
058	HEB	002	010	For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to perfect the Author of their salvation by sufferings.
058	HEB	002	011	For both he that sanctifies, and they who are sanctified, are all of one. For which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,
058	HEB	002	012	saying, “I will declare thy name to my brethren, in the midst of the church I will sing hymns to thee.”
058	HEB	002	013	And again, “I will place my confidence in him.” And again, “Behold! Here am I, and the children which God hath given me.”
058	HEB	002	014	Seeing therefore that the children have partaken of flesh and blood, he also himself, in exact resemblance, partook of the same, that by death he might destroy him who held the power of death, that is, the devil;
058	HEB	002	015	and deliver those, even as many as through their whole life were subjects of bondage to the fear of death.
058	HEB	002	016	For he verily took not on him the angelic nature, but assumed that of the seed of Abraham.
058	HEB	002	017	Wherefore he ought in all things to be made like to his brethren, in order to become a merciful and faithful high-priest in those things which relate to God, to make a propitiation for the sins of the people:
058	HEB	002	018	for inasmuch as he hath himself suffered, having been tempted, he is able to succour those who are tempted.
058	HEB	003	001	WHEREFORE, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, contemplate the apostle and high-priest whom ye confess, Jesus Christ;
058	HEB	003	002	who was faithful to him who appointed him, as Moses also was in all his house.
058	HEB	003	003	For this personage hath been counted worthy of higher glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who built it, hath greater honour than the house.
058	HEB	003	004	For every house is built by some person; but he who is the architect of all things is God.
058	HEB	003	005	And Moses indeed was faithful in all that house of his as a servant, to bear testimony of the things which should be after spoken;
058	HEB	003	006	but Christ as a son over his own house: whose house are we, if we hold firmly the confidence and glorying of hope stedfast unto the end.
058	HEB	003	007	Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,
058	HEB	003	008	harden not your hearts, as in that bitter provocation, at the day of the temptation in the wilderness;
058	HEB	003	009	when your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works during forty years.
058	HEB	003	010	Wherefore I was provoked against that generation, and said, They are always deluded in heart, and they have not known my ways:
058	HEB	003	011	so I swore in my wrath that they shall not enter into my rest.
058	HEB	003	012	Take heed, brethren, that there be not in any one of you a wicked heart of infidelity, evident in departure from the living God:
058	HEB	003	013	but exhort one another daily, whilst to-day remains, that no one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
058	HEB	003	014	For we are partakers with Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence firm unto the end;
058	HEB	003	015	while it is said, To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts as in the provocation.
058	HEB	003	016	For some, though they had heard, provoked him; yet not all who came out of Egypt by Moses.
058	HEB	003	017	But against whom was he incensed forty years? Was it not against those who had sinned, whose corpses fell in the wilderness?
058	HEB	003	018	And to whom did he swear that they should not enter into his rest, but to those who did not believe?
058	HEB	003	019	So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.
058	HEB	004	001	LET us fear then lest, though a promise be left of entering into his rest, any one of you should appear to fail of obtaining it.
058	HEB	004	002	For we are hearing the same gospel preached as they did; but the word heard did not profit them, not being incorporated by faith with those who heard it.
058	HEB	004	003	For we who have believed, have entered into the rest, even as he said, “So, I sware in my wrath, that they shall not enter into my rest;” and that notwithstanding the works were done from the foundation of the world.
058	HEB	004	004	For he said in a certain passage concerning the seventh day to this purport, “And God rested on the seventh day from all his works.”
058	HEB	004	005	And in this passage again, “They shall not enter into my rest.”
058	HEB	004	006	Forasmuch therefore as it remaineth for some to enter into it, and they who first had the gospel preached to them entered not in because of unbelief;
058	HEB	004	007	again he limiteth a certain day, saying by David, To-day, after so long a time; as it is said, “To-day if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts.”
058	HEB	004	008	For if Joshua had given them the rest, he would not afterwards have spoken of another day.
058	HEB	004	009	A sabbatical rest then still remaineth for the people of God.
058	HEB	004	010	For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath rested from his works, as God did from his own.
058	HEB	004	011	Let us then earnestly endeavour to enter into that rest, lest any person fall after the same example of unbelief.
058	HEB	004	012	For the word of God is quickening, and energetic, and sharper than every two-edged sword, and piercing through and through, so as to divide both soul and spirit, both joints and spinal marrow, and critically judges the thoughts and intents of the heart.
058	HEB	004	013	Even creation is not invisible before him, but all things are naked, and fully displayed before his eyes, to whom we must give our account.
058	HEB	004	014	Having then a great high-priest passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast the confession.
058	HEB	004	015	For we have not an high-priest incapable of a fellow-feeling with our infirmities, but one tempted in all points, in exact resemblance with ourselves, sin excepted.
058	HEB	004	016	Let us therefore approach with boldness the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and find grace for seasonable help.
058	HEB	005	001	FOR, every high-priest taken from among men, is constituted on behalf of men for those services which relate to God, that he should offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:
058	HEB	005	002	being able to feel tenderly for the ignorant and erroneous; forasmuch as he is himself encompassed with infirmity.
058	HEB	005	003	And on this account he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer sacrifice for sins.
058	HEB	005	004	And no man assumes to himself this honour, but he who is called of God, even as Aaron was.
058	HEB	005	005	So Christ also did not himself assume the glory to become high-priest, but he gave it who spake to him, “Thou art my Son; I have this day begotten thee.”
058	HEB	005	006	As he saith also in another passage, “Thou art priest forever after the order of Melchisedec;”
058	HEB	005	007	who in the days of his flesh, with strong crying and tears, having offered up prayers and supplications to him who was able to save him from death, and being heard for his reverential awe,
058	HEB	005	008	though he was a son, he learned obedience from the things which he suffered:
058	HEB	005	009	and complete himself, he became the author of eternal salvation to all who obey him;
058	HEB	005	010	publicly proclaimed of God high-priest after the order of Melchisedec.
058	HEB	005	011	Concerning whom we have much to discourse, and of difficult interpretation to explain, seeing ye are dull of hearing.
058	HEB	005	012	For though ye ought for the time to be teachers of others, ye have again need that some one teach you the leading principles of the oracles of God; and are become as those who need milk, and not solid food.
058	HEB	005	013	For every one who useth milk is inexperienced in the word of righteousness: for he is an infant.
058	HEB	005	014	But solid nourishment is proper for grown men, even as many as by habit have their organs of perception exercised for the discernment both of good and evil.
058	HEB	006	001	WHEREFORE, desisting from initiatory discourse respecting Christ, let us advance towards perfection; not again laying a foundation of repentance from dead works, and faith in God,
058	HEB	006	002	of the doctrine of ablutions, and of imposition of hands, and of the resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.
058	HEB	006	003	And so we will do, if God permit.
058	HEB	006	004	For it is not possible to renew again unto repentance those who have been once illuminated, and have tasted the celestial gift, and have been made partakers of the Holy Ghost,
058	HEB	006	005	and have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,
058	HEB	006	006	and yet have fallen away: for they crucify again to themselves the Son of God, and expose him to public infamy.
058	HEB	006	007	For the earth which imbibes the rain which often falls upon it, and bringeth forth herbage suitable for those by whom it is cultured, receiveth a blessing from God;
058	HEB	006	008	but if it produceth thorns and thistles, it is abandoned, and near the curse of barrenness, whose end will be for burning.
058	HEB	006	009	But, beloved, we are persuaded concerning you that things are better, and connected with salvation, though we thus speak.
058	HEB	006	010	For God is not unjust, to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have demonstrated in his name, having ministered assistance to the saints, and still ministering.
058	HEB	006	011	But we earnestly desire that every one of you do manifest the same diligence, in order to obtain the full assurance of hope unto the end:
058	HEB	006	012	that ye be not slothful, but imitators of those who, by faith and long suffering, are inheriting the promises.
058	HEB	006	013	For God when he gave the promise to Abraham forasmuch as he had nothing greater to swear by, sware by himself,
058	HEB	006	014	saying, “Verily, blessing, I will bless thee, and multiplying, I will multiply thee.”
058	HEB	006	015	And so after long patient waiting he obtained the promise.
058	HEB	006	016	For men indeed swear by something greater than themselves; and an oath for confirmation is with them conclusive in all disputes.
058	HEB	006	017	And thus God, designing more abundantly to demonstrate to the heirs of promise the immutability of his will, pledged himself by oath,
058	HEB	006	018	that by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us;
058	HEB	006	019	which, as an anchor for our soul, we hold both sure and stedfast, and entering into the sanctuary within the vail,
058	HEB	006	020	into which the forerunner for us is entered, even Jesus, made after the order of Melchisedec an high-priest for ever.
058	HEB	007	001	FOR this Melchisedec, king of Salem, a priest of God most high, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;
058	HEB	007	002	to whom also Abraham gave a tenth share of all the spoil: being, as the interpretation of his name imports, first, King of righteousness, and then also King of Salem, that is, King of peace:
058	HEB	007	003	without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but in exact resemblance with the Son of God, abideth a priest for ever.
058	HEB	007	004	Now observe how great is this Melchisedec, to whom even Abraham the patriarch gave the tenth of the spoils.
058	HEB	007	005	For they indeed of the sons of Levi, who are admitted to priesthood, have an order to receive tithes from the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though also sprung from the loins of Abraham.
058	HEB	007	006	But he who derived not his genealogy from them, received tithes from Abraham, and blessed him who had the promises;
058	HEB	007	007	but without all dispute the inferior receives benediction from the superior.
058	HEB	007	008	And here indeed dying men receive the tithes, but there he hath a testimony borne to him that he liveth.
058	HEB	007	009	And, if I may so say, through Abraham even Levi, who receiveth tithes, paid tithes.
058	HEB	007	010	For he was as yet in the loins of his father when Melchisedec met him.
058	HEB	007	011	If therefore there was perfection by the Levitical priesthood (for under that the people had the law given to them), what farther need was there that another priest should arise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?
058	HEB	007	012	For the priesthood being transferred, there is of necessity an abrogation of the law also.
058	HEB	007	013	For he to whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe, in which no man approached the altar.
058	HEB	007	014	For it is evident that our Lord sprang from Judah; to which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning the priesthood;
058	HEB	007	015	and it is yet more abundantly evident, that there should arise another priest after the likeness of Melchisedec,
058	HEB	007	016	who was not made such by the law of a carnal commandment, but by the power of a life indissoluble.
058	HEB	007	017	For the testimony is, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
058	HEB	007	018	For there is indeed an abrogation of the preceding command, because of its weakness and inutility.
058	HEB	007	019	For the law led to no perfection, but was an introduction to a better hope, by which we draw nigh unto God.
058	HEB	007	020	Moreover, forasmuch as he was not made priest without an oath,
058	HEB	007	021	(for they indeed were made priests without an oath; but he with an oath, by him who said unto him, “The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:”)
058	HEB	007	022	by so much is Jesus become the surety of a better testament.
058	HEB	007	023	And they indeed are many who were made priests, because by death they were prevented from abiding in their office:
058	HEB	007	024	but this person, because he abideth for ever, hath a priesthood that passeth not over to another.
058	HEB	007	025	Wherefore also he is able to save to the uttermost those who come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.
058	HEB	007	026	For such an high-priest was suitable to us, holy, inoffensive, spotless, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens:
058	HEB	007	027	who hath not daily need, as the high-priests, first, to offer sacrifice for their own sins, afterwards, for those of the people: for this he did once for all, when he offered up himself.
058	HEB	007	028	For the law constitutes men high-priests, though they have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which is since the law, constitutes the Son, unto eternity completely perfect.
058	HEB	008	001	NOW the summary of the things spoken is this: we have such an high-priest, who hath taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of Majesty in the heavens;
058	HEB	008	002	a minister of the holies, and of the true tabernacle which the Lord hath pitched, and not man.
058	HEB	008	003	For every high-priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is necessary that this person also have somewhat to offer.
058	HEB	008	004	For if he were on earth, he would not be a priest, there being priests who offer gifts according to the law;
058	HEB	008	005	who perform the service after the figure and shadow of things in the heavens, as Moses was divinely instructed, when he was about to finish the tabernacle. “For see,” saith God, “that thou make all things according to the model shewed thee on the mount.”
058	HEB	008	006	But now hath Christ obtained a more excellent ministry, inasmuch as he is the mediator of a better covenant, which hath been established on better promises.
058	HEB	008	007	For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no place sought for a second.
058	HEB	008	008	For finding fault with them, he saith, “Behold, the days are coming, saith the Lord; and I will accomplish for the house of Israel and for the house of Judah a new covenant:
058	HEB	008	009	not according to that covenant which I made with their fathers, in the day when I laid hold upon their hand to lead them up out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I took no longer care of them, saith the Lord.
058	HEB	008	010	For this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; giving my laws to their understanding, even on their hearts will I inscribe them: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people.
058	HEB	008	011	And they shall no more teach every man his neighbour, and every one his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me from the mean man of them unto the great among them.
058	HEB	008	012	For I will be placable to their unrighteousnesses and their sins, and their iniquities I will never more remember.”
058	HEB	008	013	In calling it a new covenant, he hath made the first antiquated. Now what is antiquated and grown aged, is near evanescence.
058	HEB	009	001	THEN also the first tabernacle had indeed regulations for the divine service, and a sanctuary furnished.
058	HEB	009	002	For the tabernacle was prepared; the first part, in which was both the candlestick, and the table, and the shew-bread, which is called the holy.
058	HEB	009	003	But behind the second vail was the tabernacle, called the holy of holies:
058	HEB	009	004	having the golden censer, and the coffer of the covenant, overlaid with gold within and without, in which were the golden urn containing the manna, and Aaron’s rod which had budded, and the stone tables of the covenant;
058	HEB	009	005	and above, over it the cherubim of glory, overshadowing the propitiatory.
058	HEB	009	006	Now when these things were thus disposed, the priests entered continually into the first tabernacle indeed, performing the divine services:
058	HEB	009	007	but into the second once in every year entered the high-priest alone, not without blood, which he offered for his own inadvertencies, and for those of the people:
058	HEB	009	008	the Holy Ghost thus signifying, that the way into the holies was not yet made manifest, whilst the first tabernacle held its station;
058	HEB	009	009	which figurative representation continues unto the present time, according to which both gifts and sacrifices are offered, which cannot, with respect to conscience, make him perfect who performs the services,
058	HEB	009	010	as they consist only of meats, and drinks, and different ablutions, and corporal services, until the appointed time of perfect reformation.
058	HEB	009	011	But Christ becoming the high-priest of future good things, through a better and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is, not of this creation;
058	HEB	009	012	nor by the blood of goats and of calves, but by his own blood, he entered once for all into the holies, having obtained eternal redemption.
058	HEB	009	013	For if the blood of bulls, and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the defiled sanctifieth to corporal purification,
058	HEB	009	014	how much more shall the blood of Christ, who, by the eternal Spirit, offered up himself in sacrifice without blemish to God, cleanse our conscience from dead works, that we may perform divine service to the living God?
058	HEB	009	015	And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that, death being suffered for the redemption of transgressions committed against the first testament, they who are called might receive the promise of an eternal inheritance.
058	HEB	009	016	For where a testament is, of necessity the death of the testator is implied.
058	HEB	009	017	For a testament is valid when men are dead; for else it is of no efficacy whilst the testator is alive.
058	HEB	009	018	Wherefore also that first testament was not consecrated without blood.
058	HEB	009	019	For when every command according to the law had been spoken by Moses to all the people, taking the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, he sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,
058	HEB	009	020	saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.
058	HEB	009	021	And the tabernacle also, and all the vessels employed in the divine service, he in like manner sprinkled with blood.
058	HEB	009	022	And almost all things are purified by blood according to the law, and without effusion of blood there is no remission of sin.
058	HEB	009	023	There was a necessity therefore that the representations of the things in heaven should be purified by these; but the celestial things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
058	HEB	009	024	For Christ is not entered into the holies made with hands, the antitypes of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear before the presence of God for us:
058	HEB	009	025	and not that he should often offer up himself in sacrifice, as the high-priest enters every year into the holies with blood not his own,
058	HEB	009	026	(for in that case he must have suffered often since the foundation of the world: ) but now once for all at the consummation of the ages hath he been manifested for the abolishing sin by the sacrifice of himself.
058	HEB	009	027	And forasmuch as it is appointed to men once to die, but after this the judgment,
058	HEB	009	028	so Christ having been once offered in sacrifice to bear the sins of men, will appear the second time without sin, to those who expect him, for their salvation.
058	HEB	010	001	NOW the law, having a shadow of the good things which were to come, not the very substance of the things, cannot possibly, by the same sacrifices which they offer year by year continually, make those perfect who approach God;
058	HEB	010	002	else they would have discontinued to make the offering, because they who performed the service being once made clean, would have had no more sense of sins on their conscience.
058	HEB	010	003	But in these sacrifices there is a commemoration of sins every year.
058	HEB	010	004	For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sin.
058	HEB	010	005	Wherefore, coming into the world, he saith, “Sacrifice and oblation thou hast not chosen, but thou hast exactly fashioned a body for me:
058	HEB	010	006	thou hast had no delight in whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin:
058	HEB	010	007	then I said, Here am I; (in the volume of the book it is written of me) I come to do thy will, O God.”
058	HEB	010	008	Having said before that sacrifice, and oblation, and whole burnt-offerings and sin-offerings thou hast not chosen, nor takest pleasure in, (which are offered according to the law, )
058	HEB	010	009	he then added, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He abolishes the first that he may establish the second.
058	HEB	010	010	By the which will we are sanctified through the oblation of the body of Jesus Christ, once for all.
058	HEB	010	011	And every priest standeth indeed daily performing the divine service, and frequently offering the same sacrifices, which cannot possibly take away sins:
058	HEB	010	012	but this person, having offered one sacrifice for sins, for ever hath seated himself at the right hand of God;
058	HEB	010	013	henceforth waiting till his enemies be put as a footstool for his feet.
058	HEB	010	014	For by one oblation he hath made those perfect for ever who are sanctified.
058	HEB	010	015	Now the Holy Ghost also beareth this testimony to us: for after declaring before,
058	HEB	010	016	“This is the testament which I will appoint to them after those days, saith the Lord; giving my laws to their hearts, even on their minds will I inscribe them;”
058	HEB	010	017	he adds, “and their sins and their iniquities I will in no wise remember any more.”
058	HEB	010	018	Now where there is remission of these, no more offering for sin is needed.
058	HEB	010	019	Having therefore, brethren, entire liberty of entrance into the holies by the blood of Jesus―
058	HEB	010	020	a way, which he hath consecrated for us, newly opened, and giving life, through the vail, that is, his flesh;
058	HEB	010	021	and having a great priest over the house of God,
058	HEB	010	022	let us come to him with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and the body washed with pure water:
058	HEB	010	023	let us hold fast the profession of hope unwavering, (for he who promises is faithful.)
058	HEB	010	024	and let us attentively observe one another, to excite an ardour of love and of good works:
058	HEB	010	025	not deserting the assembling of ourselves together, as is the custom with some, but exhorting to it; and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.
058	HEB	010	026	For if we sin wilfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no more sacrifice for sins remaineth;
058	HEB	010	027	but a certain terrible expectation of judgment, and a burning indignation, ready to devour these enemies.
058	HEB	010	028	Any man who treated the law of Moses with neglect, was put to death, without mercy, on the deposition of two or three witnesses:
058	HEB	010	029	by how much, think ye, shall he be counted worthy of more condign punishment who hath trampled on the Son of God, and regarded the blood of his testament, by which he was sanctified, as an unclean thing, and hath treated the gracious Spirit contumeliously?
058	HEB	010	030	For we know him who declares, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord.” And again, “The Lord will judge his people.”
058	HEB	010	031	It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
058	HEB	010	032	But remember the past days in which, after ye had been illuminated, ye endured a great conflict of sufferings;
058	HEB	010	033	partly while publicly exposed to revilings and tribulations, partly as being in communion with those who were treated in this manner.
058	HEB	010	034	For ye have been fellow-sufferers with my bonds, and received with joy the plundering of your properties, knowing in yourselves that you have in the heavens a better substance, and permanent.
058	HEB	010	035	Recede not therefore from your boldness of profession, which brings a great recompence of reward.
058	HEB	010	036	For ye have need of patience, that after ye have done the will of God, ye may receive the promise.
058	HEB	010	037	For yet a little, very little while, and he that is coming will come, and will not delay.
058	HEB	010	038	“The just man then will live by faith;” and if he draw back, my soul shall have no delight in him.
058	HEB	010	039	But we are not of those who turn back unto perdition; but of those who believe to the salvation of the soul.
058	HEB	011	001	NOW faith is the realizing confidence of the things hoped for, and the demonstration of things unseen:
058	HEB	011	002	for thereby the ancients obtained a testimony of approbation.
058	HEB	011	003	By faith we understand that the worlds were exactly formed by the word of God, so that the visible objects were not made out of things which now appear.
058	HEB	011	004	By faith Abel offered unto God a sacrifice of more excellence than Cain, by which he received a testimony that he was a righteous man, God bearing witness upon his gifts: and by this, though dead, he still speaketh.
058	HEB	011	005	By faith Enoch was translated, so as not to see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he was recorded to have been acceptable to God.
058	HEB	011	006	But without faith it is impossible to be acceptable; for he must believe, who cometh unto God, that he exists, and is a rewarder of those who diligently seek him.
058	HEB	011	007	By faith Noah, being divinely warned respecting things not yet seen, filled with reverential awe, prepared an ark for the salvation of his household, by which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.
058	HEB	011	008	By faith Abraham, called to go forth unto a place which he should in future obtain as an heritage, obeyed; and he went forth, not knowing whither he was going.
058	HEB	011	009	By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as a foreign land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the co-heirs of the same promise.
058	HEB	011	010	For he expected a city having foundations, of which God is the planner and architect.
058	HEB	011	011	By faith also that very Sarah, who was barren, received ability for the conception of seed, and past the usual time of life brought forth a child, because she accounted that he who promised it, would be true to his promise.
058	HEB	011	012	Wherefore even from one person, and he become dead in respect to these matters, there sprang a race, as the stars of heaven for multitude, and as the sand, which is on the shore of the sea, innumerable.
058	HEB	011	013	All these died in faith, not having received the promises, but beholding them at a great distance, though believing and embracing them, and confessing that they were strangers and sojourners in the land.
058	HEB	011	014	Now they who speak thus, shew evidently that they are in earnest search of their native country.
058	HEB	011	015	And if indeed they had fixed their minds on that from whence they had gone forth, they might have had opportunity to go back to it again.
058	HEB	011	016	But now their longing desires are after a better country, that is, the heavenly one: wherefore God is not ashamed of them to be called their God: for he hath prepared a city for them.
058	HEB	011	017	By faith Abraham, when tried, offered up Isaac; and he who had received the promise, presented in sacrifice his only begotten son,
058	HEB	011	018	unto whom it had been said, “That by Isaac shall there be a seed bearing thy name:”
058	HEB	011	019	reasoning that God was able to raise him up again, even from the dead; from whence also figuratively he had received him.
058	HEB	011	020	By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau with regard to future things.
058	HEB	011	021	By faith, dying Jacob blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and bowed down in adoration upon the top of his staff.
058	HEB	011	022	By faith Joseph, approaching his end, made mention of the children of Israel’s departure thence; and gave a charge respecting his bones.
058	HEB	011	023	By faith Moses, after he was born, was hid three months by his parents, because they saw the child singularly beautiful; and they were not intimidated by the command of the king.
058	HEB	011	024	By faith Moses, when he became a grown man, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter;
058	HEB	011	025	choosing rather to suffer afflictions with the people of God, than to have a temporary fruition of sin;
058	HEB	011	026	esteeming the reproach of Christ riches greater than the treasures of Egypt: for he looked earnestly to the recompence of reward.
058	HEB	011	027	By faith he forsook Egypt, not intimidated by the wrath of the king: for he boldly persisted, as seeing the invisible Jehovah.
058	HEB	011	028	By faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of the blood, that the destroyer of the first-born might not touch them.
058	HEB	011	029	By faith they passed through the Red sea, as on dry ground; which the Egyptians attempting to do were swallowed up.
058	HEB	011	030	By faith the walls of Jericho fell, after being circled round seven days.
058	HEB	011	031	By faith Rahab the harlot perished not with those who were infidels, having received the spies in peace.
058	HEB	011	032	And what more shall I say: for the time would fail me if I should make a narration concerning Gideon, and Barac, and Sampson, and Jephtha, and David, and Samuel, and the prophets:
058	HEB	011	033	who by faith vanquished kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,
058	HEB	011	034	extinguished the force of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, they were made strong out of weakness, became mighty in battle, routed the armies of aliens.
058	HEB	011	035	Women received by a resurrection their dead: but others were tortured, not accepting a release; that they might obtain a better resurrection:
058	HEB	011	036	and others had trials of mockeries and whippings, yea and farther of chains and imprisonment:
058	HEB	011	037	they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, they experienced the severest trials, they were slain by the edge of the sword: they went about wrapped in skins of sheep and goats, destitute of all things, pressed down with afflictions, suffering all kind of misery;
058	HEB	011	038	of whom the world was not worthy: they wandered up and down in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens, and caverns of the earth.
058	HEB	011	039	And these all though having obtained a testimony by faith, received not the promise:
058	HEB	011	040	God having provided for us something better, that without us they should not attain to perfection.
058	HEB	012	001	THEREFORE also seeing we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, laying aside every weight, and that most easily besetting sin, let us run with patience the race lying before us,
058	HEB	012	002	earnestly looking up to Jesus the author and the finisher of faith; who, for the joy set before him, endured the cross, despising shame, and hath sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
058	HEB	012	003	Consider then attentively him that endured from sinners such opposition against himself, that ye be not wearied out, fainting in your souls.
058	HEB	012	004	As yet ye have not resisted unto blood, struggling against sin.
058	HEB	012	005	And have you forgotten the exhortation which is addressed to you, as children, “My son, count not lightly of the Lord’s childlike correction, nor faint when under his rebuke:
058	HEB	012	006	for whom the Lord loveth he correcteth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.”
058	HEB	012	007	If ye patiently endure correction, God carries himself towards you as his children: for who is the son whom the father doth not correct?
058	HEB	012	008	If then ye are without correction, of which all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not children.
058	HEB	012	009	If then we have had the fathers of our flesh for correctors, and reverenced them; shall we not much more be under subjection to the Father of spirits, and live?
058	HEB	012	010	For they indeed for a few days as seemed proper to themselves corrected us; but he for our own advantage, that we might be partakers of his holiness.
058	HEB	012	011	Now all correction at the moment seemeth not to be cause for joy, but for sorrow; but after a while it produceth peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have thereby been disciplined.
058	HEB	012	012	Wherefore stretch out again the hands that hang down, and the paralytic knees;
058	HEB	012	013	and make strait paths for your feet, that what is halting may not be turned out of the way; but that it may rather be healed.
058	HEB	012	014	Earnestly seek peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:
058	HEB	012	015	carefully observing lest any of you fail of attaining the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and by it many be defiled;
058	HEB	012	016	lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of bread parted with his birthrights.
058	HEB	012	017	For ye know, that when afterwards he wished to inherit the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place for a change of his father’s mind, though he sought it earnestly with tears.
058	HEB	012	018	For ye have not approached the mountain that could only be groped for, and that burned with fire, and the thick cloud, and the darkness, and the tempest,
058	HEB	012	019	and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words, which they who heard, earnestly begged that the discourse might not be directed to them:
058	HEB	012	020	for they could not bear the charge given, and “If but a beast touch the mountain he shall be stoned, or shot through with a dart:”
058	HEB	012	021	and so terrible was the appearance, that Moses said, I am exceedingly afraid and trembling:
058	HEB	012	022	but ye are come unto mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, to the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels,
058	HEB	012	023	and to the general assembly and church of the first-born registered in the heavens, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of just men perfected,
058	HEB	012	024	and to Jesus the mediator of the new testament, and to the blood of sprinkling, which speaketh better things than that of Abel.
058	HEB	012	025	Beware that ye reject not him that speaketh: for if they escaped not, who rejected him, that upon earth spake by divine influence, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him who speaks from heaven:
058	HEB	012	026	whose voice then shook the earth, but now he hath promised, saying, “Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also the heaven.”
058	HEB	012	027	Now this word yet once more manifests the removal of the things shaken, as of things formed, that the things not shaken may endure.
058	HEB	012	028	Wherefore receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, may we hold fast the grace, by which we can offer to God acceptably divine service, with reverence and pious awe:
058	HEB	012	029	for our God is a devouring fire.
058	HEB	013	001	LET brotherly love continue.
058	HEB	013	002	Forget not to exercise hospitality: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.
058	HEB	013	003	Remember those who are in chains, as in chains with them; and those who are suffering afflictions, as being yourselves also in the body.
058	HEB	013	004	Marriage is honourable for all persons, and the marriage bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.
058	HEB	013	005	Let the tenor of your life be divested of the love of money; content with your present possessions: for he hath said, “I will in no wise leave thee, neither will I in any case forsake thee.”
058	HEB	013	006	So that we may with confidence say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.
058	HEB	013	007	Remember your presidents, who have spoken to you the word of God: the ultimate issue of whose conduct attentively observing, be imitators of their fidelity.
058	HEB	013	008	Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever.
058	HEB	013	009	Be not tossed about by various and strange doctrines: for it is good to have the heart firmly established by grace, not by meats, in which observances they who have walked have found no manner of advantage.
058	HEB	013	010	We have an altar, of which they have no right to eat, who perform the service in the tabernacle.
058	HEB	013	011	For the bodies of those beasts are burnt without the camp, whose blood for a sin offering is brought into the holy of holies by the high-priest.
058	HEB	013	012	Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.
058	HEB	013	013	Therefore let us go forth to him without the camp, bearing his reproach.
058	HEB	013	014	For we have not here an abiding city, but we earnestly seek that which is to come.
058	HEB	013	015	By him therefore let us offer a sacrifice of praise perpetually to God, that is the fruit of our lips confessing his name.
058	HEB	013	016	But of beneficence, and liberal distribution, be not unmindful: for such sacrifices God accepts with delight.
058	HEB	013	017	Obey your presidents, and be subject to them: for they are vigilant for your souls, as being to render an account, that they may do it with joy, and not groaning: for that would be disadvantageous for you.
058	HEB	013	018	Pray for us: for we have confidence that we maintain a good conscience, in all things desirous to conduct ourselves with propriety.―
058	HEB	013	019	But I entreat you the rather to do this, that I may the more speedily be restored to you.
058	HEB	013	020	Now the God of peace, who brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great pastor of the sheep, by the blood of the everlasting testament,
058	HEB	013	021	make you fit for every good work to do his will, producing in you that which is acceptable in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory unto the everlasting ages. Amen.
058	HEB	013	022	But I entreat you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation; for I have written to you in few words.
058	HEB	013	023	Know that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.
058	HEB	013	024	Salute all your presiding ministers, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.
058	HEB	013	025	Grace be with you all.―Amen. Written to the Hebrews from Italy by Timothy.

# BOOK	059	JAM	James	James
059	JAM	001	001	JAMES, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are dispersed, greeting.
059	JAM	001	002	My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into various trials;
059	JAM	001	003	knowing that the proof of your faith produceth patience.
059	JAM	001	004	But let patience have its work perfected, that ye may be perfect and complete, deficient in nothing.
059	JAM	001	005	But if any man of you be deficient in wisdom, let him ask it of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not and it shall be given him.
059	JAM	001	006	But let him ask in faith, harbouring no doubt: for he who is doubtful is like a wave of the sea, driven by the wind, and in constant agitation.
059	JAM	001	007	For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing from the Lord.
059	JAM	001	008	A double-minded man is unsteady in all his ways.
059	JAM	001	009	Let the brother low in station rejoice in his elevation:
059	JAM	001	010	but the rich, in his abasement: for as the flower of grass he shall pass away.
059	JAM	001	011	For the sun arose with fervour, and burnt up the grass, and the flower of it fell off, and the beauty of its appearance was lost: just so the rich man in his course of life shall wither away.
059	JAM	001	012	Blessed is the man who patiently supports temptation: for when he is proved, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to those who love him.
059	JAM	001	013	Let no man under temptation say, I am tempted of God: for God is incapable of temptation from evils, and he tempteth no man:
059	JAM	001	014	but every person is tempted, when by his own peculiar passion he is born away, and ensnared.
059	JAM	001	015	Then passion impregnated, bringeth forth sin, and sin reaching its consummation, bringeth forth death.
059	JAM	001	016	Be not deceived, my beloved brethren.
059	JAM	001	017	Every good gift, and every perfect gift, is from above, descending from the father of illuminations, with whom there is no variableness, nor shadow of change.
059	JAM	001	018	Of his own choice he produced us by the word of truth, that we might be a sort of first fruit of his creatures.―
059	JAM	001	019	Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath.
059	JAM	001	020	For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.
059	JAM	001	021	Wherefore laying aside all vicious pollution, and the abundance of iniquity, receive with meekness the ingrafted word, which hath power to save your souls.
059	JAM	001	022	But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves by false reasoning.
059	JAM	001	023	For if any man be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like a man that looks at his natural face in a glass;
059	JAM	001	024	for he beheld himself, and went away, and immediately forgot what sort of person he was.
059	JAM	001	025	But he that looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and perseveres, this man not being a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, he shall be blessed in his practice.
059	JAM	001	026	If any man thinks he is a religious character among you, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man’s religion is vain.
059	JAM	001	027	Pure religion and undefiled with God even the Father is this, To pay diligent attention to the orphans and widows in their affliction, and to preserve himself spotless from the world.
059	JAM	002	001	MY brethren, hold not the faith of our glorious Lord Jesus shewing a respect for persons.
059	JAM	002	002	For if there come into your congregation a man with a gold ring, and in splendid apparel, and there come in also a poor man in a sordid garb;
059	JAM	002	003	and ye fix your eyes upon him who bears the splendid robe, and say to him, Sit thou here in an honourable place; and ye say to the poor man, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:
059	JAM	002	004	are you not thus partial among yourselves, and form your decision from bad reasonings?
059	JAM	002	005	Hear me, my beloved brethren. Hath not God elected the poor of this world to be rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which God hath promised to those who love him;
059	JAM	002	006	but ye have put contempt on the poor man? Do not the rich men tyrannize over you? and they drag you to the tribunals.
059	JAM	002	007	Do they not blaspheme that honourable name by which ye are called?
059	JAM	002	008	If indeed ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:
059	JAM	002	009	but if ye have respect of persons, ye commit sin, and are convicted by the law as transgressors.
059	JAM	002	010	For whosoever shall keep the whole law, but offendeth in a single particular, he is chargeable with the breach of all.
059	JAM	002	011	For he that said, Thou shalt not commit adultery, said also, Thou shalt not commit murder. Now if thou dost not commit adultery, yet dost commit murder, thou art a transgressor of the law.
059	JAM	002	012	So speak, and so act, as those who shall be judged by the law of liberty.
059	JAM	002	013	For judgment without mercy shall be on him who shewed no mercy, and mercy glorieth against judgment.
059	JAM	002	014	What is the advantage, my brethren, if a man profess to have faith, but hath not works; can faith save him?
059	JAM	002	015	Now if a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,
059	JAM	002	016	and should one of you say to them, Go in peace, be warm, be replenished with food: yet if ye give them not the necessaries for their body; what doth it avail?
059	JAM	002	017	So also faith, if it hath not works, is dead itself.
059	JAM	002	018	Perhaps a man will say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith by thy works, and I will shew thee by my works my faith.
059	JAM	002	019	Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe and tremble.
059	JAM	002	020	But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?
059	JAM	002	021	Was not our father Abraham justified by works, when he offered up Isaac his son upon the altar?
059	JAM	002	022	Thou seest that faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith consummated.
059	JAM	002	023	And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, “Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness;” and he was called “the friend of God.”
059	JAM	002	024	Observe therefore that by works a man is justified, and not by faith merely.
059	JAM	002	025	But was not Rahab the harlot in like manner justified by works, when she entertained the messengers, and sent them away by a different road?
059	JAM	002	026	For as the body without breath is dead, so faith without works is dead also.
059	JAM	003	001	MY brethren, be not many teachers, knowing that we shall receive a severer judgment.
059	JAM	003	002	For in many things we all offend. If any man offend not in word, he is a perfect man, and capable of reining in the whole body.
059	JAM	003	003	Behold, we put bits into the horses’ mouths, that they may obey us, and we turn about their whole body.
059	JAM	003	004	Behold also the ships, though so great, and driven by tempestuous winds, are turned about by the smallest rudder, whithersoever the inclination of the pilot pleaseth.
059	JAM	003	005	So also the tongue is a little member, and proudly vaunts. Behold how great a pile of wood, a little fire kindleth!
059	JAM	003	006	And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: in such manner is the tongue placed among our members, that it defileth all the body, and setteth on fire the circle of nature; and is set on fire of hell.
059	JAM	003	007	For every species of wild beasts, and also of birds, of reptiles, and even of fishes, is tamed, and hath also been tamed by human ingenuity:
059	JAM	003	008	but the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.
059	JAM	003	009	With it we bless God even the Farther; and with the same we curse men, though after the likeness of God.
059	JAM	003	010	Out of the same mouth goeth forth blessing and cursing. These things, my brethren, ought not to be thus.
059	JAM	003	011	Doth a fountain from the same aperture spout forth sweet water and bitter?
059	JAM	003	012	Can a fig-tree, my brethren, produce olives; or a vine figs? so also can no fountain send forth salt water and sweet.
059	JAM	003	013	Who is a wise man and intelligent among you, let him shew in a becoming conduct his works with the meekness of wisdom.
059	JAM	003	014	But if ye have bitter envy and contention in your heart, boast not, and lie not against the truth.
059	JAM	003	015	This is not the wisdom which cometh from above, but is earthly, sensual, diabolical.
059	JAM	003	016	For where envy and contention dwell, there is tumult and every vile deed.
059	JAM	003	017	But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, meek, easily persuadable, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial, and void of dissimulation.
059	JAM	003	018	But the fruit of righteousness in peace is sown for those who are peacemakers.
059	JAM	004	001	FROM whence come wars and conflicts among you? spring they not from hence, even from your passions, which war in your members?
059	JAM	004	002	Ye eagerly covet, yet have not: ye murder, and are envious, yet cannot obtain your object; ye wage war, but have not, because ye pray not.
059	JAM	004	003	Ye ask, and receive nothing, because ye ask vilely, in order to consume it on your sensual appetites.
059	JAM	004	004	Ye adulterers and adultresses, know ye not that friendship with the world is enmity against God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is set down an enemy to God.
059	JAM	004	005	Think ye that the scripture saith without meaning, The spirit which dwelleth in you strongly urges to envy?
059	JAM	004	006	But he giveth mightier grace. Wherefore he saith, “God sets himself against the proud, but giveth grace to the lowly.”
059	JAM	004	007	Be in subjection then to God. Resist the devil, and he will fly from you.
059	JAM	004	008	Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Make clean your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double-minded.
059	JAM	004	009	Be bitterly afflicted and lament, and let your tears run down; let your laughter be converted into mourning, and your joy into dejection.
059	JAM	004	010	Be humbled in the presence of God, so he will exalt you.
059	JAM	004	011	Traduce not one another, brethren. He that traduceth his brother, and judgeth his brother, traduceth the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judgest the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but as judge.
059	JAM	004	012	There is one lawgiver, who can save or destroy: who art thou that judgest another man?
059	JAM	004	013	Come now, ye that talk, To-day or to-morrow we will go to such a town, and do business there during one year, and traffic, and make great profits:
059	JAM	004	014	though ye know nothing of what shall be to-morrow. For what is your life? It is but a vapour which appeareth for a little while, and then vanishes away.
059	JAM	004	015	Instead of your saying, If the Lord pleases, and we are alive, then we will do this or that thing.
059	JAM	004	016	But now ye glory in your proud boastings: all such glorying is wicked.
059	JAM	004	017	Therefore if a man knoweth how to act properly, and doth not, he is criminal.
059	JAM	005	001	COME now, ye rich men, let your tears run down, howling over your miseries which are coming upon you.
059	JAM	005	002	Your wealth is corrupted, and your robes are moth-eaten.
059	JAM	005	003	Your gold and silver is cankered with rust; and the rust upon them is a testimony against you, and shall eat into your flesh as fire. Ye have heaped up treasures in the last days.
059	JAM	005	004	Behold, the wages of the workmen who have mowed down your fields, which is kept back by you from them, crieth out: and the loud moans of the reapers are entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.
059	JAM	005	005	Ye have gormandized upon the earth, and lived in every luxury: ye have pampered your hearts, as in a day of feasting on the victim slain.
059	JAM	005	006	Ye have falsely condemned, ye have murdered the just man; nor doth he resist you.
059	JAM	005	007	Be patient therefore, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. See, the husbandman waits for the precious fruit of the earth, in patient expectation for it, till it receives the former and the latter rain.
059	JAM	005	008	Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts; for the coming of the Lord is at hand.
059	JAM	005	009	Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest be ye condemned: lo! the judge standeth at the gates.
059	JAM	005	010	My brethren, take a pattern for suffering affliction, and patience from the prophets, who have spoken to you in the name of the Lord.
059	JAM	005	011	Behold, we esteem those blessed who patiently endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; for the Lord is full of bowels of mercy, and tenderly compassionate.
059	JAM	005	012	But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, nor by earth, nor by any other oath: but let your yea be yea, and your no, no; that ye fall not under condemnation.
059	JAM	005	013	Is any man among you under afflictions? let him pray. Is any man happy in mind? let him sing psalms.
059	JAM	005	014	Is any man sick among you? let him send for the presbyters of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:
059	JAM	005	015	and the prayer of faith shall recover the sick man, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he hath committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.
059	JAM	005	016	Confess your offences one to another, and pray for one another, that ye may be healed. The energetic prayer of a righteous man is mightily prevalent.
059	JAM	005	017	Elias was a man of like feelings with us, and he prayed fervently that it should not rain; and there fell no rain on the earth during three years and six months.
059	JAM	005	018	And he prayed again, and the heavens gave rain, and the earth shot up its fruit.
059	JAM	005	019	Brethren, if any man among you should have erred from the truth, and one convert him;
059	JAM	005	020	let him know, that he that converteth a sinner from the error of his way will save a soul from death, and will cover a multitude of sins.

060	1PE	001	001	PETER, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the sojourners, dispersed through Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
060	1PE	001	002	elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by sanctification of the Spirit, that they might be brought to the obedience, and sprinkled with the blood of Jesus Christ: grace unto you and peace be multiplied.
060	1PE	001	003	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto an animating hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
060	1PE	001	004	for an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and unfading, reserved in the heavens for you,
060	1PE	001	005	who are guarded by the omnipotence of God, through faith to obtain the salvation which is ready to appear at the last time.
060	1PE	001	006	Wherein ye exult, though yet for a little space, (if it must be so, ) ye are in sorrow through various trials:
060	1PE	001	007	that the test of your faith (much more precious than that of gold, which is of a perishing nature, though proved by fire) may be found unto praise and honour and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ:
060	1PE	001	008	whom though ye have not seen, ye love; on whom, though ye have not as yet gazed, yet believing, ye exult with joy unutterable and glorious:
060	1PE	001	009	receiving the end of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
060	1PE	001	010	Concerning which salvation the prophets eagerly sought and diligently inquired, who prophesied of the grace which is come to you:
060	1PE	001	011	investigating to what time and to what conjuncture the Spirit of Christ in them pointed, when predicting the sufferings coming upon Christ, and the glories subsequent thereto.
060	1PE	001	012	To whom it was revealed, that not for themselves, but for us were their ministrations employed in the things which are now declared unto you by those who have preached the gospel unto you by the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; on which things the angels bending forwards eagerly desire to gaze.
060	1PE	001	013	Wherefore girding up the loins of your mind, vigilant, wait with assured hope for the grace, which shall be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;
060	1PE	001	014	as obedient children, not conformed to the former passions of the days of your ignorance:
060	1PE	001	015	but as he who hath called you is holy, be ye holy also in all your conduct:
060	1PE	001	016	because it is written, “Be ye holy; for I am holy.”
060	1PE	001	017	And if ye invoke him as Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man’s work, conduct yourselves during the time of your sojourning with jealous fear:
060	1PE	001	018	knowing that ye have not been redeemed out of your vain manner of life, derived traditionally from your fathers, by the corruptible things, silver and gold,
060	1PE	001	019	but by the precious blood of Christ, as the unblemished and spotless lamb:
060	1PE	001	020	who was indeed predestined before the foundation of the world, but manifested in these last times for us,
060	1PE	001	021	who by him believe in God, that raised him from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.
060	1PE	001	022	Having purified your souls by obedience to the truth through the Spirit unto fraternal affection undissembled, love each other intensely out of a pure heart:
060	1PE	001	023	born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the quickening word of God, and which abideth for ever.
060	1PE	001	024	“For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man, as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower of it falleth off:”
060	1PE	001	025	but the word of the Lord abideth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.
060	1PE	002	001	WHEREFORE putting far away wickedness of every kind, and all deceit, and hypocrisies, and envyings, and all backbitings,
060	1PE	002	002	as new-born babes desire earnestly the unadulterated milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:
060	1PE	002	003	if so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.
060	1PE	002	004	Whom approaching, as the living stone, rejected indeed of men, but elect of God, and honourable,
060	1PE	002	005	ye also, as living stones, are built up, a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices, well pleasing to God through Jesus Christ.
060	1PE	002	006	Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, “Behold, I lay in Sion a cornerstone, elect, precious, and the believer on him shall never be confounded.”
060	1PE	002	007	By you therefore who believe is he honoured: but respecting the disobedient, “the stone which the builders rejected, this very stone is become the head of the corner,
060	1PE	002	008	and a stone of stumbling, and rock of offence,” to those who stumble at the word, disobedient; whereunto also they were appointed.
060	1PE	002	009	But ye are an elect race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people acquired by purchase; that ye should publish abroad the excellencies of him, who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:
060	1PE	002	010	who in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God; who had not obtained mercy, but are now the objects of mercy.
060	1PE	002	011	Beloved, I exhort you, as strangers and sojourners, Abstain from carnal lusts, which war against the soul;
060	1PE	002	012	having your conduct ornamental among the Gentiles: that, whereas they malign you as wicked doers, they may, being eye-witnesses of your good works, glorify God in the day when he visits them.
060	1PE	002	013	Be subject therefore to every human constitution for the Lord’s sake; whether to a king as the supreme magistrate;
060	1PE	002	014	or to governors, as sent by him for the punishment of wicked doers, but the praise of those who do well.
060	1PE	002	015	For such is the will of God, that by well doing ye hold under restraint the ignorance of foolish men:
060	1PE	002	016	as free, yet not using liberty as a cloak for wicked practices; but as being servants of God.
060	1PE	002	017	Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.
060	1PE	002	018	Servants, be in subjection to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but even to the froward.
060	1PE	002	019	For this is gracious conduct, if for conscience towards God, any man undergo sorrows, suffering wrongfully.
060	1PE	002	020	For what glory would there be, if committing faults, and being buffeted, ye suffered patiently? but if, when ye behave well, yet suffer, ye bear it patiently, this is graciously accepted of God.
060	1PE	002	021	For hereunto have ye been called, because Christ also hath suffered for you, leaving you a pattern, that ye should follow his steps;
060	1PE	002	022	who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:
060	1PE	002	023	who, when reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he used no menaces; but referred himself to him who judgeth righteously:
060	1PE	002	024	who himself bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead unto sins, might live unto righteousness; “by whose stripes, even his, ye were healed.”
060	1PE	002	025	For ye were as sheep wandering astray; but are now returned unto the pastor and bishop of your souls.
060	1PE	003	001	LIKEWISE, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, even if some obey not the word, by their wives’ conduct without the word, they may be won over;
060	1PE	003	002	being eye-witnesses of your chaste behaviour with timidity.
060	1PE	003	003	Whose adorning let it not be that exterior one of braided locks, and golden trimmings, and dresses put on with nicety;
060	1PE	003	004	but let it be the hidden man of the heart, with that incorruptible ornament of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God highly valuable.
060	1PE	003	005	For so in times of old the holy women also, who hoped in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands;
060	1PE	003	006	as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose children ye are, if ye do well, and are not affrighted with any terror.
060	1PE	003	007	Ye husbands, in like manner dwell with them discreetly, putting respect on the dear woman as being the weaker vessel, and as co-heirs of the grace of life, so that your prayers may meet no interruption.
060	1PE	003	008	Finally, be all like-minded, sympathizing, loving fraternally, compassionate, friendly hearted,
060	1PE	003	009	not returning evil for evil, or railing for railing; but, contrariwise, wishing men every blessing; knowing that hereunto ye have been called, that ye should inherit the divine benediction.
060	1PE	003	010	“For he that would love life, and see good days, let him restrain his tongue from evil, and his lips from speaking guile.
060	1PE	003	011	Let him depart from every wicked thing, and do good; let him seek peace, and pursue it.”
060	1PE	003	012	For the eyes of the Lord are upon the just, and his ears open to their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against those who practise wicked things.
060	1PE	003	013	And who will do you harm if ye be imitators of him that is good?
060	1PE	003	014	But if ye should even suffer for righteousness, blessed are ye: be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled,
060	1PE	003	015	but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be always ready with your reply to every man who demands a reason respecting the hope which is in you with meekness and fear:
060	1PE	003	016	keeping a good conscience; that whereas they malign you, as evil doers, they may be confounded who take pleasure in ridiculing your good conduct in Christ.
060	1PE	003	017	For it is better (if it be God’s will) to suffer as well doers than as evil doers.
060	1PE	003	018	For Christ also suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, put to death indeed in the flesh, but raised to life by the Spirit:
060	1PE	003	019	by which also he went and preached to those spirits imprisoned;
060	1PE	003	020	who in time of old were disobedient, when the long suffering of God in the days of Noe waited, while the ark was preparing, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were preserved through the water.
060	1PE	003	021	The antitype to which baptism now saveth us (not the mere removal of filth from the flesh, but the engagement of a good conscience to God), by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:
060	1PE	003	022	who is at the right hand of God, gone into heaven, angels and dominations and powers being put in subjection under him.
060	1PE	004	001	CHRIST then having suffered for us in the flesh, be ye also in mind armed for the same conflict: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sinning;
060	1PE	004	002	that he might not spend the remaining space of life in the flesh after human passions, but the divine will.
060	1PE	004	003	For the time past of life is enough for us to have wrought the will of the heathen, when we walked in all impurities, lewd appetites, excess of wine, revels, drinking-bouts, and abominable idolatries;
060	1PE	004	004	wherein they think it a strange thing, that you are not running with them into the same gulph of profligacy, spreading every scandalous report of you:
060	1PE	004	005	who shall give an account to him, who holds himself ready to judge the living and the dead.
060	1PE	004	006	For to this end was the gospel preached to those that are dead, that they might be judged indeed in the flesh according to the will of men, but live in spirit according to the will of God.
060	1PE	004	007	But the end of all things is near: be ye therefore sober-minded, and vigilant in prayers.
060	1PE	004	008	But above all things have fervent love towards each other: for love will conceal a multitude of faults.
060	1PE	004	009	Exercise hospitality one towards another without grudgings.
060	1PE	004	010	Let every one, according as he hath received a gift, minister it to others, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.
060	1PE	004	011	If any man speak, let it be agreeably to the oracles of God; if any man act as a deacon, let it be from the strength which God supplieth: that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory and might for ever and ever. Amen.
060	1PE	004	012	Beloved, be not amazed at the fiery trial among you which is to bring you to the test, as though something strange happened to you;
060	1PE	004	013	but as ye share in the sufferings of Christ rejoice, that at the revelation of his glory also ye may hail him with exultations.
060	1PE	004	014	If ye suffer reproach for the name of Christ, blessed are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: by them indeed he is blasphemed, but by you he is glorified.
060	1PE	004	015	Let no one of you then suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evil-doer, or a meddler in other persons’ business.
060	1PE	004	016	But if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him give glory to God on this very account.
060	1PE	004	017	For now is the time when judgment is commencing at the house of God; and if it begin with us, what will be the end of those who obey not the gospel of God?
060	1PE	004	018	And if the righteous man is hardly saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?
060	1PE	004	019	Wherefore let those who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls to him in well-doing as to the faithful Creator.
060	1PE	005	001	THE presbyters among you I exhort, who am a co-presbyter and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a partaker of the glory which shall be revealed:
060	1PE	005	002	feed the flock of God which is among you, exercising your pastoral office not of necessity, but of choice, not for base gain, but with alacrity of mind;
060	1PE	005	003	not as domineering over your allotted congregations, but as being examples of the flock.
060	1PE	005	004	And when the arch Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that will never fade away.
060	1PE	005	005	In like manner, ye who are younger persons, be in subjection to your elders: but all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed from head to foot with humility: for God sets himself in opposition to the proud, but he giveth grace to the lowly.
060	1PE	005	006	Humble yourselves therefore beneath the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due season:
060	1PE	005	007	casting all your anxiety upon him; for he careth for you.
060	1PE	005	008	Be sober, be vigilant; for your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, prowleth around, seeking whom he may devour:
060	1PE	005	009	against whom stand fast, firm in the faith, knowing that the very same sufferings are fully endured by the brotherhood which is in the world.
060	1PE	005	010	But the God of all grace, who hath called us to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, when ye have suffered a little while, himself perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.
060	1PE	005	011	To him be glory and might for ever and ever. Amen.
060	1PE	005	012	By Silvanus, a faithful brother as I think, I have written to you a few words, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye are standing fast.
060	1PE	005	013	She who is co-elect at Babylon, saluteth you, and my son Mark.
060	1PE	005	014	Salute one another with a kiss of love. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.

# BOOK	061	2PE	2 Peter	2 Peter
061	2PE	001	001	SIMON Peter, the servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have obtained with us the same precious faith by the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ:
061	2PE	001	002	grace unto you and peace be multiplied through the knowledge of God, even Jesus our Lord,
061	2PE	001	003	as his divine power hath freely given us all things tending to life and godliness, through the acknowledgment of him who hath called us to glory and fortitude:
061	2PE	001	004	whereby superlatively great and precious promises are freely given to us: that by these ye might become partakers of a divine nature, having fled far away from the corruption that is in the world through inordinate concupiscence.―
061	2PE	001	005	And for this very purpose employing the greatest diligence, lead up in the train of your faith courage; and with courage intelligence;
061	2PE	001	006	and with intelligence moderation; and with moderation patience; and with patience piety;
061	2PE	001	007	and with piety fraternal affection; and with fraternal affection love.
061	2PE	001	008	For if these things are in your possession, and abounding, they will render you neither inactive nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
061	2PE	001	009	But he that hath no possession of these things, is blind, dim-sighted, sinking into oblivion of his purification from the sins of his former days.
061	2PE	001	010	Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make sure your calling and election: for by doing these things, ye shall never at any time stumble:
061	2PE	001	011	but an entrance will thus be richly afforded you into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
061	2PE	001	012	Wherefore I will not be negligent continually to remind you of these things, though ye know them, and are established in the present truth.
061	2PE	001	013	Indeed, I think it right, as long as I am in this frail tabernacle, to rouse up your attention by reminding you:
061	2PE	001	014	knowing that the deposition of this frail tabernacle of mine is hastily approaching, as our Lord Jesus Christ hath made evident to me.
061	2PE	001	015	I will endeavour then that even after my decease, ye may always have wherewith to preserve the remembrance of these things.
061	2PE	001	016	For we have not followed artfully devised fables, when we made known to you the power and advent of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eye-witnesses of his majesty.
061	2PE	001	017	For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when such a voice was sent forth to him from the transcendently magnificent glory, This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased.
061	2PE	001	018	And this voice we heard coming out of heaven, when we were with him on the holy mountain.
061	2PE	001	019	And we hold the prophetic word more confirmed, to which ye do well to attend, as to a lamp shining in a dark passage, until the day dawn, and the morning-star arise upon your hearts.
061	2PE	001	020	Knowing this in the first place, that all scriptural prophecy is not from any man’s own suggestions.
061	2PE	001	021	For prophecy in old time came not by the will of man: but the holy men of God spake under the impulse of the Holy Ghost.
061	2PE	002	001	BUT there were false prophets among the people, as there will be false teachers also among you, who wickedly introduce damnable heresies, and deny the sovereign Lord who bought them, bringing on themselves swift destruction.
061	2PE	002	002	And many will go out of the way after their fatal errors; by means of whom the way of truth will be injuriously reviled.
061	2PE	002	003	And with plausible speeches will they avariciously make gain of you whose condemnation from of old lingereth not, and their perdition doth not slumber.
061	2PE	002	004	For if God spared not the angels when they sinned, but casting them bound in chains of darkness into hell, delivered them to be kept fast until the judgment;
061	2PE	002	005	and spared not the old world, but guarded safely Noah the eighth person, the preacher of righteousness, when he brought a deluge on the world of the ungodly:
061	2PE	002	006	and reducing the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes, condemned them to final destruction, making them an example for all who in future should live ungodly;
061	2PE	002	007	but righteous Lot, afflicted grievously with the infamously impure conduct of those lawless men, he plucked out:
061	2PE	002	008	for by seeing and hearing, that righteous man whilst sojourning among them, suffered torment day by day in his righteous soul from their lawless doings;
061	2PE	002	009	the Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation, but to reserve the wicked unto the day of judgment to be punished:
061	2PE	002	010	especially such as walk after the flesh in the eager pursuit of defilement, and despise government. Daring, self-sufficient, they tremble not at dignities, railing against them.
061	2PE	002	011	Whereas the angels, though so much greater in might and power, bring not a reviling accusation against them before the Lord.
061	2PE	002	012	But these men, as the naturally irrational brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speaking evil of the things of which they are ignorant, will perish by their own corruption;
061	2PE	002	013	receiving the recompence of iniquity, counting daily luxury their pleasure; spots and blemishes, when they feast together with you; riotously indulging in their own delusions:
061	2PE	002	014	having eyes full of adultery, and insatiable of sin; ensnaring souls of no stability; having a heart practised in all the wiles of covetousness; children for a curse:
061	2PE	002	015	who forsaking the strait road are gone out of the way, following the path of Balaam the son of Bosor who loved the wages of iniquity.
061	2PE	002	016	But received a reproof for his peculiar transgression: the dumb ass articulating with a human voice restrained the perverseness of the prophet.
061	2PE	002	017	These are fountains without water, clouds driven by a hurricane; for whom the blackness of darkness for ever is reserved.
061	2PE	002	018	Uttering pompous discourses of inanity, ensnaring by the lusts of the flesh, by lascivious impurities, those who had truly escaped from such as live in a course of delusion.
061	2PE	002	019	Preaching liberty to them, while they themselves are the slaves of corruption: for by whatever a man is overcome, by that also he is enslaved.
061	2PE	002	020	For if having escaped from the defilements of the world by the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again enveloped by them and overcome, their last deeds are worse than the first.
061	2PE	002	021	For it had been better for them never to have been acquainted with the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to have turned aside from the holy commandment delivered unto them.
061	2PE	002	022	But the true proverb is verified in them, The dog hath returned to his own vomit; and the sow which was washed to its wallowing in the mire.
061	2PE	003	001	THIS second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I rouse up your sincere mind by awakening your recollection
061	2PE	003	002	to remember the words, that have been spoken aforetime by the holy prophets, and the injunction of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:
061	2PE	003	003	knowing this principally, that in the last of the days there will come scoffers, walking after their own lewd passions,
061	2PE	003	004	and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue in the same state as from the beginning of the creation.
061	2PE	003	005	For this they chuse to keep out of sight, that by the word of God the heavens were created of old, and the earth rising out of the water and subsisting amidst the water;
061	2PE	003	006	whence the world then existing, being deluged by water, was destroyed;
061	2PE	003	007	but the present heavens and earth by the same word are treasured up, reserved for fire at the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.
061	2PE	003	008	But let not this particular be concealed from you, beloved, that one day with the Lord is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
061	2PE	003	009	The Lord doth not delay the promise (as some count it delay); but is longsuffering towards us, not willing that any should perish, but that all should have space for repentance.
061	2PE	003	010	But the day of the Lord will come as a thief by night; in which the heavens shall pass away with a rushing noise, and the first principles of matter in flames dissolve, and the earth and all the works upon it be burnt up.
061	2PE	003	011	Seeing then that all these things must be dissolved, what manner of persons ought we to be in a course of holy conduct and acts of piety,
061	2PE	003	012	expecting and hastening towards the coming of God’s day, at which the heavens on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements in flames be melted as wax?
061	2PE	003	013	But we expect according to his promise new heavens and a new earth in which dwelleth righteousness.
061	2PE	003	014	Wherefore, beloved, seeing ye are expecting these things, be diligent to be found of him in peace, spotless and blameless.
061	2PE	003	015	And account the long suffering of our Lord conducive to salvation; as our beloved brother Paul also, according to the wisdom given to him, hath written unto you;
061	2PE	003	016	as also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things, of which some are difficult to be understood, which the uninstructed and the unstable torture, as indeed they do the rest of the scriptures unto their own destruction.
061	2PE	003	017	Ye therefore, beloved, knowing this before, be on your guard, that ye be not carried away with the delusion of these lawless men, and fall from your own stedfastness.
061	2PE	003	018	But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory now and unto the day of eternity. Amen.

062	1JO	001	002	(for the life was manifested, and we have beheld it, and bear testimony, and declare unto you that life eternal, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us; )
062	1JO	001	003	that which we have seen and heard, declare we to you, that ye also may have communion with us: and indeed our communion is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.
062	1JO	001	004	And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be complete.
062	1JO	001	005	And this is the promise which we have heard from him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and that darkness in him there is none.
062	1JO	001	006	If we say that we have communion with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and practise not the truth:
062	1JO	001	007	but if we walk in the light, as he is himself in the light, we have communion with each other, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.
062	1JO	001	008	If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
062	1JO	001	009	If we confess our sins, faithful is he and righteous to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
062	1JO	001	010	If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.
062	1JO	002	001	MY dear children, these things I write to you, that ye should not sin. And if any of us sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:
062	1JO	002	002	and he himself is the propitiatory victim for our sins: and indeed not for ours only, but for the whole world.
062	1JO	002	003	And hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.
062	1JO	002	004	He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and in him the truth is not.
062	1JO	002	005	But whosoever keepeth his word, verily in him is the love of God perfected: by this we know that we are in him.
062	1JO	002	006	He who saith that he abideth in him, ought as he walked, even so himself to walk.
062	1JO	002	007	Brethren, I write not a new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning: the old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.
062	1JO	002	008	Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which is a true thing in him, and in you, because the darkness is past, and the true light is now shining.
062	1JO	002	009	He who saith, that he is in the light, yet hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now.
062	1JO	002	010	He that loveth his brother is in the light, and occasion of stumbling in him there is none.
062	1JO	002	011	But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he is departing, because the darkness hath blinded his eyes.
062	1JO	002	012	I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name’s sake.
062	1JO	002	013	I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father.
062	1JO	002	014	I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him, who is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.
062	1JO	002	015	Love not the world, neither the things which are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
062	1JO	002	016	For every thing which is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pomp of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.
062	1JO	002	017	And the world is passing away, and the lust thereof, but he who doeth the will of God abideth for ever.
062	1JO	002	018	My dear children, it is the last hour; and as ye have heard that antichrist is coming, even now there are many antichrists: by which we know it is the last hour.
062	1JO	002	019	They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us; but they departed, that they might be made manifest that they are not all of us:
062	1JO	002	020	though ye have an unction from the Holy One, and know all things.
062	1JO	002	021	I have not written to you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.
062	1JO	002	022	Who is the liar, but he that denieth that Jesus is the Messiah? This man is the antichrist, who denieth the Father and the Son.
062	1JO	002	023	Every one that denieth the Son, neither doth he hold the Father; but he that acknowledgeth the Son, holdeth the Father also.
062	1JO	002	024	Let that abide in you therefore which ye have heard from the beginning. If that abide in you which ye heard from the beginning, ye also shall abide in the Son and in the Father.
062	1JO	002	025	And this is the promise which he hath promised to us, even life eternal.
062	1JO	002	026	These things have I written unto you concerning those who are leading you astray.
062	1JO	002	027	But the unction which ye have received from him abideth in you; and ye need not that any person should instruct you. But as the same unction teacheth you concerning all things, and is true, and is no lie; and as it hath taught you, abide in him.
062	1JO	002	028	And now, my dear children, abide in him; that when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be put to shame by him at his coming.
062	1JO	002	029	If ye know that he is righteous, know that every one who practises righteousness is born of him.
062	1JO	003	001	BEHOLD, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called children of God! therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.
062	1JO	003	002	Beloved, now are we the children of God, and it is not yet evident what we shall be: but we know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him; because we shall see him as he is.
062	1JO	003	003	And every one who hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.
062	1JO	003	004	Every one who committeth sin, committeth also a transgression of the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.
062	1JO	003	005	And ye know that he was manifested, that he might take away our sins; and in him there is no sin.
062	1JO	003	006	Every one who abideth in him, doth not sin; every one who sinneth hath not seen him, nor known him.
062	1JO	003	007	My dear children, let no man deceive you: he who doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous:
062	1JO	003	008	he that practises sin is of the devil; for from the beginning the devil sinneth. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.
062	1JO	003	009	Every one who is born of God, doth not practise sin, because his seed abideth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.
062	1JO	003	010	By this the children of God are manifestly seen, and the children of the devil. Every one that doth not practise righteousness, is not of God, and he that loveth not his brother.
062	1JO	003	011	For this is the commandment which ye have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.
062	1JO	003	012	Not as Cain, who was of the wicked one, and slew his brother: and wherefore did he slay him? Because his own works were wicked, and those of his brother righteous.
062	1JO	003	013	Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.
062	1JO	003	014	We know that we are passed out of a state of death into life, because we love the brethren: he that loveth not his brother abideth in death.
062	1JO	003	015	Every one who hateth his brother is a murderer; and ye know that no murderer hath life eternal abiding in him.
062	1JO	003	016	By this we have known the love of Christ, because for us he laid down his own life: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.
062	1JO	003	017	But whosoever hath worldly abundance, and seeth his brother under necessity, and shutteth his bowels of compassion against him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?
062	1JO	003	018	My dear children, let us not love in word and in tongue, but in deed and in truth;
062	1JO	003	019	and hereby we know that we are of the truth, and in his presence have this persuasion in our hearts.
062	1JO	003	020	For should our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.
062	1JO	003	021	Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, we have confidence towards God.
062	1JO	003	022	And whatsoever we ask, we receive from him, because we keep his commandments, and do the things which are pleasing in his sight.
062	1JO	003	023	And this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.
062	1JO	003	024	And he that keepeth his commandments abideth in him, and he in him; and by this we know that he abideth in us, from the Spirit which he hath given us.
062	1JO	004	001	BELOVED, believe not every pretender to inspiration, but bring these spirits to the trial whether they are of God; because many false prophets are gone forth into the world.
062	1JO	004	002	By this ye know the Spirit of God: every spirit who confesseth that Jesus the Messiah is come in the flesh, is from God.
062	1JO	004	003	And every spirit who confesseth not that Jesus the Messiah is come into the world, is not from God: and this is that spirit of antichrist which ye have heard that it is coming, and now is already in the world.
062	1JO	004	004	Ye are of God, my dear children, and have overcome them; because he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world.
062	1JO	004	005	They are of the world, therefore speak they as of the world, and the world heareth them.
062	1JO	004	006	We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth us not. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of delusion.
062	1JO	004	007	Beloved, let us love one another; because love is from God, and every one who loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.
062	1JO	004	008	He that loveth not, never knew God; for God is love.
062	1JO	004	009	By this was the love of God manifested to us, that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might have life by him.
062	1JO	004	010	Herein is love, not that we have loved God, but that he hath loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiatory sacrifice for our sins.
062	1JO	004	011	Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.
062	1JO	004	012	No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God abideth in us, and his love is perfected in us.
062	1JO	004	013	By this we know that we abide in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his own Spirit.
062	1JO	004	014	And we have seen and bear testimony, that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.
062	1JO	004	015	Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abideth in him, and he in God.
062	1JO	004	016	And we have known and believed the love which God hath towards us. God is love; and he that abideth in love, abideth in God, and God in him.
062	1JO	004	017	By this is his love towards us perfected, that we might have confidence at the day of judgment; because as he is, so are we in this world.
062	1JO	004	018	Fear is not in this love; but the perfect love casteth out fear: for fear hath anguish. He that is afraid is not made perfect in love.
062	1JO	004	019	We love him, because he first loved us.
062	1JO	004	020	If any person say, I love God, yet hateth his brother, he is a liar; for he who loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love the God whom he hath not seen?
062	1JO	004	021	So this commandment have we from him, that he who loveth God love also his brother.
062	1JO	005	001	EVERY one who believeth that Jesus is the Messiah, is born of God; and every one who loveth him that begat, loveth him also who is begotten by him.
062	1JO	005	002	Hereby we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments.
062	1JO	005	003	For this is the love of God, that we should keep his commandments: and his commandments are not burdensome.
062	1JO	005	004	Because every one that is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory which overcometh the world, our faith.
062	1JO	005	005	Who is he that overcometh the world, except he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?
062	1JO	005	006	This is he who came by water and blood, Jesus the Messiah; not by the water only, but by the water and the blood: and the Spirit is the witnessing person, because the Spirit is the truth.
062	1JO	005	007	For they are three who bear witness in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and these, even the three, are one.
062	1JO	005	008	And there are three which bear witness upon earth, the spirit, and the water, and the blood, and the three are for the same one object.
062	1JO	005	009	If we receive the testimony of man, the testimony of God is stronger: for this is the testimony of God which he testified concerning his Son.
062	1JO	005	010	He that believeth on the Son of God, hath the testimony in himself; he that believeth not God, hath made him a liar, because he hath not believed on the testimony which God testified of his Son.
062	1JO	005	011	And this is the testimony, that God hath given life eternal to us; and this life is in his Son.
062	1JO	005	012	He that hath the Son, hath this life; and he that hath not the Son of God, hath not this life.
062	1JO	005	013	These things have I written to you who believe on the name of the Son of God, that ye may know that ye have life eternal, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.
062	1JO	005	014	And this is the confidence that we have towards him, that whatsoever we ask according to his will, he heareth us.
062	1JO	005	015	And if we know that he heareth us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we receive the petitions, which we have requested, from him.
062	1JO	005	016	If any person see his brother committing a sin not unto death, he shall request, and God will grant him life for those that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I say not that he should request for that.
062	1JO	005	017	All unrighteousness is sin; and there is sin not unto death.
062	1JO	005	018	We know that every one who is born of God sinneth not; but he that is born of God preserveth himself, and the wicked one toucheth him not.
062	1JO	005	019	We know that we are of God, and the whole world is under the power of that wicked one.
062	1JO	005	020	But we know that the Son of God hath come, and hath given to us understanding, that we might know the true God; and we are in him that is true, in his Son Jesus the Messiah. HE is the true God, and the life eternal.
062	1JO	005	021	My dear children, guard yourselves against idols. Amen.

063	2JO	001	001	THE presbyter to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all who have known the truth:
063	2JO	001	002	because of the truth which abideth in us, and shall be with us for ever:
063	2JO	001	003	grace, mercy, peace be with you from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
063	2JO	001	004	I rejoiced greatly that I found thy children walking in truth, as we have received commandment from the Father.
063	2JO	001	005	And now I beseech thee, lady, not as writing to thee a new commandment, but that which we have had from the beginning, that we should love one another.
063	2JO	001	006	And this is love, that we should walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, as ye have heard from the beginning, That ye should walk in it.
063	2JO	001	007	For many deceivers are gone out into the world, who do not confess Jesus the Messiah as come in the flesh. Such a one is a deceiver and an antichrist.
063	2JO	001	008	Take heed to yourselves that we lose not the things which we have wrought, but receive a full reward.
063	2JO	001	009	Every one that transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God: he that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, this man holdeth both the Father and the Son.
063	2JO	001	010	If any person come unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into the house, nor say to him, Welcome.
063	2JO	001	011	He that biddeth him welcome, takes part in his wicked works.
063	2JO	001	012	Having many things to write unto you, I would not do it with paper and ink; but I hope to come unto you, and speak mouth to mouth, that our joy may be complete.
063	2JO	001	013	The children of thy elect sister salute thee. Amen.

064	3JO	001	001	THE presbyter to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.
064	3JO	001	002	Beloved, above all things I pray that thou mayest prosper, and be in sound health of body, even as thy soul prospereth.
064	3JO	001	003	I rejoiced greatly when the brethren came, and bore witness to thy truth, even as thou walkest in the truth.
064	3JO	001	004	I have no greater joy than these tidings, that I hear my own children are walking in the truth.
064	3JO	001	005	Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever services thou performest for the brethren, and for strangers;
064	3JO	001	006	who have borne testimony to thy love before the church; to whom thou wilt perform a good act of service in forwarding them on their journey, in a manner worthy of God.
064	3JO	001	007	For on account of his name they went forth, receiving nothing from the heathen.
064	3JO	001	008	We therefore ought to assist such men, that we may become fellow-labourers in the truth.
064	3JO	001	009	I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who affects pre-eminence over them, receiveth us not.
064	3JO	001	010	Therefore if I come I will remember his works which he doth, with wicked words prating against us; and not content with these things, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and those who are willing he hindereth, and casteth them out of the church.
064	3JO	001	011	Beloved, be not an imitator of what is evil, but of that which is good. He that doeth good is of God, but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.
064	3JO	001	012	Demetrius hath a good testimony from all men, and from the truth itself: and we also bear our testimony, and ye know that our testimony is true.
064	3JO	001	013	I had many things to write; but I would not write to thee with ink and pen:
064	3JO	001	014	but I hope shortly to see thee, and we shall speak mouth to mouth. Peace be to thee. The friends salute thee. Salute the friends by name.

# BOOK	065	JUD	Jude	Jude
065	JUD	001	001	JUDE a servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to those who are sanctified in God the Father, and preserved by Jesus Christ, the called:
065	JUD	001	002	mercy unto you, and peace and love be multiplied.
065	JUD	001	003	Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you concerning the common salvation, I held it necessary to write unto you, exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith once delivered unto the saints.
065	JUD	001	004	For certain men have craftily introduced themselves, who were from of old proscribed for this condemnation, ungodly men, changing the grace of God into impurity, and denying our only sovereign God and Lord, Jesus Christ.
065	JUD	001	005	But I would remind you, though ye once knew this, that the Lord, though he delivered the people out of the land of Egypt, afterwards destroyed those who believed not.
065	JUD	001	006	And the angels who preserved not their own primitive state, but deserted their proper abode, hath he reserved in everlasting chains under darkness, unto the judgment of the great day.
065	JUD	001	007	As Sodom and Gomorrha and the surrounding cities, in like manner with them abandoned to whoredom, and going after other flesh, are set forth an example, suffering the judicial punishment of eternal fire.
065	JUD	001	008	In like manner also do these men, even when they dream, defile indeed the flesh, despise sovereignty, and revile dignities.
065	JUD	001	009	Though Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil, he disputed about the body of Moses, dared not to produce a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.
065	JUD	001	010	But these men speak evil even of the things of which they have no knowledge: but such things as they know naturally, as the brute beasts, in these they corrupt themselves.
065	JUD	001	011	Wo unto them! for they have walked in the way of Cain, and have eagerly run in Balaam’s erroneous path of hire, and have perished in opposition, like Corah.
065	JUD	001	012	These are in your feasts of love, as sunken rocks; though joining in your banquet, they feed themselves fearlessly; clouds without water carried about by the winds; trees untimely withering, fruitless, twice dead, rooted up;
065	JUD	001	013	raging billows of the sea foaming out their own infamies; stars wandering from their courses, for whom the blackness of darkness for ever is reserved.
065	JUD	001	014	Now Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied also of these men, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with myriads of his saints,
065	JUD	001	015	to execute judgment against all men, and to convict all the ungodly of all their deeds of ungodliness which they have impiously committed, and of all the bitter words which impious offenders have spoken against him.
065	JUD	001	016	These men are murmurers, complainers at their lot in life, walking after their own corrupt passions; and their mouth utters hyperbolically pompous expressions, pretending high personal admiration, in order to make their advantage.
065	JUD	001	017	But ye, beloved, remember the words which have been spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ,
065	JUD	001	018	how they told you that in the last time there will be scoffers, walking after their own ungodly passions.
065	JUD	001	019	These are the men who separate themselves, sensual, destitute of the Spirit.
065	JUD	001	020	But ye, beloved, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying by the Holy Ghost,
065	JUD	001	021	preserve yourselves in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.
065	JUD	001	022	And of some have compassion, distinguishing their case;
065	JUD	001	023	and others save with trembling, snatching them out of the fire; though hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.
065	JUD	001	024	Now to him who is able to guard you from stumbling, and to present you blameless before the presence of his glory with exultation,
065	JUD	001	025	to the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, might and dominion, both now and unto all eternity. Amen.

066	REV	001	001	THE revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to shew to his servants the things which must shortly come to pass; and sending by his angel, he shewed them to his servant John:
066	REV	001	002	who was a witness for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ, and for the things which he saw.
066	REV	001	003	Blessed is he that readeth, and they who hear the words of this prophecy, and observe the things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.
066	REV	001	004	John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be with you, and peace from him, who is, and who was, and who is coming; and from the seven spirits which are before the throne of God,
066	REV	001	005	and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, and first-born from the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth: to him who loved us, and washed us from our sins by his blood,
066	REV	001	006	and made us kings and priests to his God and Father; to him be glory and might for ever and ever. Amen.
066	REV	001	007	Behold! he is coming with clouds, and every eye shall see him, and they also who pierced him; and all the tribes of the earth shall lament bitterly, smiting their bosoms, because of him: even so! Amen.
066	REV	001	008	I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, saith the Lord, who is, and who was, and who is coming―the Almighty.
066	REV	001	009	I John, your brother and companion also with you in the tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the island which is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.
066	REV	001	010	I was rapt in spirit on the Lord’s day, and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet,
066	REV	001	011	saying, I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last; and what thou seest write in a book, and send to the churches which are in Asia: to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.
066	REV	001	012	And I turned to see what voice spake to me. And when I turned round I saw seven lamps of gold;
066	REV	001	013	and in the midst of the seven lamps one like unto a son of man, clothed to the very feet, and girded about the breasts with a golden zone;
066	REV	001	014	his head and flowing locks white as a white fleece of wool, even as the snow; and his eyes as a flame of fire;
066	REV	001	015	and his feet resembled molten brass, as though they glowed in the furnace; and his voice was as the roar of many waters.
066	REV	001	016	And he held in his right hand seven stars; and out of his mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword; and his countenance was as when the sun shineth in his meridian lustre.
066	REV	001	017	And when I beheld him, I fell at his feet as dead: and he laid his right hand upon me, saying to me, Fear not; I am the first and the last,
066	REV	001	018	and I am the living one, though I was dead and lo! I am alive for evermore, Amen; and I hold the keys of hell and of death.
066	REV	001	019	Write the things which thou seest, and the things which are, and the things which shall be in future after these,
066	REV	001	020	the mystery of the seven stars which thou seest in my right hand, and the seven golden lamps. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lamps which thou seest are the seven churches.
066	REV	002	001	TO the angel of the Ephesian church write; These things saith he who grasps the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh round in the midst of the seven golden lamps;
066	REV	002	002	I know thy works, and thy travail, and thy patience, and that thou canst not bear the wicked; and hast tried those who give themselves out as apostles, yet are not, and hast found them liars;
066	REV	002	003	and hast borne, and hast exercised patience, and for my name sake hast endured great toil, and hast not fainted.
066	REV	002	004	Yet have I a charge against thee, that thou art gone back from thy first love.
066	REV	002	005	Remember then from whence thou hast fallen, and repent, and practise thy first works; but if not, I am coming to thee quickly, and I will remove thy lamp out of its place, except thou repent.
066	REV	002	006	But this thou holdest, that thou abhorrest the deeds of the Nicolatans, which I also abhor.
066	REV	002	007	He that hath ears, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches, To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.
066	REV	002	008	And to the angel of the church of the Smyrnians write, These things saith the first and the last, who was dead, and is alive:
066	REV	002	009	I know thy works, and thy tribulation, and thy poverty (though thou art rich), and the calumnies of those who say they are Jews, yet are not, but are Satan’s synagogue.
066	REV	002	010	Fear nothing from the things which thou shalt suffer: lo! the devil will cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have a ten day’s tribulation: be thou faithful until death, and I will give thee a crown of life.
066	REV	002	011	He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. He that overcometh shall receive no injury from the second death.
066	REV	002	012	And to the angel of the church at Pergamos write, These things saith he who holdeth the sharp two-edged sword;
066	REV	002	013	I know thy works and where thou hast thy abode, even where Satan’s throne is erected: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days when Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was put to death among you, where Satan dwelleth.
066	REV	002	014	Yet I have a few things against thee, that thou hast there some who hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to lay a stumbling-block before the children of Israel, to eat of idol sacrifices, and to commit whoredom.
066	REV	002	015	Thou hast also some who hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which I abhor.
066	REV	002	016	Repent! but if not, I am coming to thee quickly, and will war against them with the sword of my mouth.
066	REV	002	017	He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches, To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white pebble, and upon the pebble a new name inscribed, which no man knoweth except the person who receiveth it.
066	REV	002	018	And to the angel of the church which is at Thyatira write, These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes as a flame of fire, and his feet like the molten brass;
066	REV	002	019	I know thy deeds, and thy love, and thy charity to the poor, and thy faith, and thy patience, and thy works, and that the last are more abundant than the first.
066	REV	002	020	Yet I have a few things against thee, because thou hast suffered that woman Jezabel, calling herself a prophetess, to teach, and to lead my servants into error, to commit whoredom, and eat the idol sacrifices.
066	REV	002	021	And I gave her a space that she should repent of her whoredom, and she hath not repented.
066	REV	002	022	Behold, I am about to cast her on a bed, and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation, unless they repent of their deeds.
066	REV	002	023	And I will slay her children by death; and all the churches shall know that I am he who searcheth the reins and the hearts: and I will give to you, even to every one, according to your works.
066	REV	002	024	But to you I say, and to the rest that are at Thyatira, as many as do not hold this doctrine, and who have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak, I will lay upon them no other burden.
066	REV	002	025	Nevertheless that which you have, hold fast till I come.
066	REV	002	026	And he who overcometh, and perseveres in my works unto the end, to him will I give authority over the nations;
066	REV	002	027	he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as a potter’s vessels they shall be broken in pieces, even as I have received authority from my Father:
066	REV	002	028	and I will give him the star of the morning.
066	REV	002	029	He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.
066	REV	003	001	AND to the angel of the church in Sardis write, These things saith he that hath the seven spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, and that thou hast a name, as though thou wert alive, yet art dead.
066	REV	003	002	Be vigilant and strengthen the things which remain, which are ready to die; for I have not found thy works complete before God.
066	REV	003	003	Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and observe, and repent. If then thou art not found watching, I will come upon thee as a thief, and thou shalt in no wise know at what hour I will come upon thee.
066	REV	003	004	Thou hast a few names even in Sardis, which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white robes, for they are worthy.
066	REV	003	005	He that overcometh, this man shall be clothed in white robes; and I will in no wise blot his name out of the book of life, and I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.
066	REV	003	006	He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.
066	REV	003	007	And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write, These things saith the Holy One, he that is true, who hath the key of David, who openeth, and none shutteth, and shutteth, and no man openeth.
066	REV	003	008	I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it; because thou hast but little strength, yet hast thou kept my word, and hast not denied my name.
066	REV	003	009	Behold, I give thee out of Satan’s synagogue those who say they are Jews, yet they are not, but do lie. Lo! I will make them that they shall come and prostrate themselves at thy feet, and they shall know that I have loved thee.
066	REV	003	010	Because thou hast keep the word of my patience, I also will preserve thee from the hour of temptation, which is coming upon the whole habitable globe to try the dwellers upon earth.
066	REV	003	011	Behold, I come quickly: hold fast that thou hast, that no man take thy crown.
066	REV	003	012	He that overcometh, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall never more go out from thence: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God, and my own new name.
066	REV	003	013	He that hath an ear to hear, let him ear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.
066	REV	003	014	And to the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write, These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the origin of the creation of God;
066	REV	003	015	I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot:
066	REV	003	016	I wish thou wert cold or hot. So because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will vomit thee out of my mouth:
066	REV	003	017	because thou sayest, I am rich, and wallow in wealth, and have no want unsupplied; yet thou knowest not that thou art wretched, and pitiable, and poor, and blind, and naked.
066	REV	003	018	I advise thee to buy of me gold purified by the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white robes, that thou mayest be completely clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness may not appear; and anoint thine eyes with a collyrium, that thou mayest see.
066	REV	003	019	As many as I love, I rebuke and correct: be zealous then, and repent.
066	REV	003	020	Lo! I stand at the door, and knock: if any person hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and I will sup with him, and he with me.
066	REV	003	021	He that overcometh, I will give to him to sit on my throne, as I also have overcome, and have sat down with my Father on his throne.
066	REV	003	022	He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.
066	REV	004	001	AFTER these things I beheld, and, lo! a door was opened in heaven, and a voice, the first which I heard, as of a trumpet, speaking to me, said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee what things will be after these.
066	REV	004	002	And immediately I was rapt in spirit: and, lo! a throne was placed in heaven, and upon the throne a person sitting.
066	REV	004	003	And he that sat was in appearance like a stone of jasper and sardine: and a rainbow encircled the throne, like in hue to an emerald.
066	REV	004	004	And around the throne were twenty-four thrones; and upon these thrones I saw twenty-four presbyters seated, clothed in white robes; and they had on their heads golden crowns.
066	REV	004	005	And out of the throne issued forth lightnings, and thunder, and loud voices; and seven lamps of fire burned before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God.
066	REV	004	006	And before the throne was a sea of glass like crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and within the circle of the throne, were four living beings full of eyes before and behind.
066	REV	004	007	And the first living being was like a lion, and the second living being was like a calf, and the third living being had a face as a man, and the fourth living being was like an eagle with wings expanded.
066	REV	004	008	And the four living beings had each for himself six wings encircling him, and within they were full of eyes; and they never cease day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is coming.
066	REV	004	009	And when these living beings give glory, and honour, and thanksgiving to him that sitteth on the throne, to him who liveth for ever and ever,
066	REV	004	010	the four and twenty presbyters prostrate themselves before him who is Seated on the throne, and worship him who liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,
066	REV	004	011	Worthy art thou, O Lord, to receive glory, and honour, and power; for thou hast created all things, and by thy will they exist, and were created.
066	REV	005	001	AND I saw on the right hand of him who was seated on the throne a volume of a book written within, and on the back sealed with seven seals.
066	REV	005	002	And I saw mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to break the seals thereon?
066	REV	005	003	And no man was able in heaven, nor upon earth, nor under the earth, to open the book, nor to look into it.
066	REV	005	004	And I wept much because no man was found worthy either to open or read the book, or even to look upon it.
066	REV	005	005	And one of the presbyters said unto me, Weep not: behold the lion who is of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, hath prevailed, to open the book, and to break the seven seals upon it.
066	REV	005	006	And I beheld, and lo! in the midst of the throne, and of the four living beings, and in the midst of the presbyters, stood a lamb as just slaughtered, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God that are sent forth into all the world:
066	REV	005	007	and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that was seated upon the throne.
066	REV	005	008	And when he had taken the book, the four living beings and the four and twenty presbyters prostrated themselves before the lamb, having each harps, and vases of gold, full of perfumes smoaking, which are the prayers of the saints.
066	REV	005	009	And they sung a new song, saying, Worthy art thou to take the book, and to open the seals thereon; because thou hast been slaughtered, and hast redeemed us for God by thy blood, out of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation;
066	REV	005	010	and hast made us for our God kings and priests, and we shall reign upon the earth.
066	REV	005	011	And I looked, and heard the voice of many angels around the throne, and the living beings, and the presbyters, and their number was myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands,
066	REV	005	012	crying with a loud voice, Worthy is the slaughtered lamb to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and might, and honour, and glory, and blessing.
066	REV	005	013	And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and those who are on the sea, and all things which are therein, heard I, saying, To him who is seated on the throne, and to the lamb, be blessing, and honour, and glory, and might for ever and ever.
066	REV	005	014	And the four living beings said, Amen. And the four and twenty presbyters prostrated themselves, and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.
066	REV	006	001	AND I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard one of the four living beings, saying, as with a voice of thunder, Come, and see.
066	REV	006	002	And I looked, and lo! a white horse; and he who sat on it held a bow, and a crown was given to him, and he went forth conquering and to conquer.
066	REV	006	003	And when he opened the second seal, I heard the second living being say, Come and see.
066	REV	006	004	And there went out another horse flame-coloured; and to him who sat thereon there was power given to take peace from the earth, and that men should kill each other; and there was given to him a great sword.
066	REV	006	005	And when he opened the third seal, I heard the third living being say, Come and see. And I saw, and lo! a black horse; and he that sat upon it had a pair of scales in his hand.
066	REV	006	006	And I heard a voice from amidst the four living beings saying, A choenix of wheat for a denarius, and three choenixs of barley for a denarius; yet to the oil and the wine do no injury.
066	REV	006	007	And when he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living being saying, Come and see.
066	REV	006	008	And I looked, and lo! a pale coloured horse, and one sat on it, whose name was Death, and the grave followed after him: and power was given to them to kill the fourth part of the earth with the sword, and with famine, and with death, and with the wild beasts of the earth.
066	REV	006	009	And when he opened the fifth seal I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they maintained.
066	REV	006	010	And they cried with a loud voice, How long will it be, O sovereign, the holy one and the true, ere thou judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?
066	REV	006	011	And to each of them were given white robes, and it was told them that they should wait yet a little longer space, until the number of their fellow-servants and their brethren, who should be slain as well as they, should be completed.
066	REV	006	012	And I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and lo! there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;
066	REV	006	013	and the stars of heaven fell to the earth, as the fig-tree sheddeth her early ripe figs when shaken by a mighty wind:
066	REV	006	014	and the heaven was removed away as a volume rolled up and every mountain and island were removed out of their places:
066	REV	006	015	and the kings of the earth, and the grandees, and the rich, and the military commanders, and the men in power, and every slave, and every free man, hid themselves in the caves, and in the rocks of the mountains;
066	REV	006	016	and said to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him who sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:
066	REV	006	017	for the great day of his wrath is come, and who is able to stand?
066	REV	007	001	AND after these things I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, to hold back the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, neither on the sea, nor on any tree.
066	REV	007	002	And I saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun, having the seal of the living God; and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom power was given for them to hurt the earth and the sea,
066	REV	007	003	saying, Hurt not the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, until we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.
066	REV	007	004	And I heard the number of those who were sealed; one hundred and forty and four thousand were sealed out of every tribe of the children of Israel.
066	REV	007	005	Of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand.
066	REV	007	006	Of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Nephtalim were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Manasseh were sealed twelve thousand.
066	REV	007	007	Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand.
066	REV	007	008	Of the tribe of Zebulon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand.
066	REV	007	009	After these things I looked, and beheld a great multitude, which no man could number, out of every nation, and tribe, and people, and tongue, standing before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, and palm branches in their hands
066	REV	007	010	and crying with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God that sitteth on the throne, and to the Lamb.
066	REV	007	011	And all the angels stood in a circle about the throne, and the presbyters and the four living beings, and fell on their faces before the throne, and worshipped God,
066	REV	007	012	saying, Amen: blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might be to our God for ever and ever. Amen.
066	REV	007	013	And one of the presbyters addressed me, saying, Who are these persons who are clothed in white robes? and from whence came they?
066	REV	007	014	And I said to him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are persons who are come out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made their robes white in the blood of the Lamb.
066	REV	007	015	Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them.
066	REV	007	016	They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun scorch them, nor any burning heat.
066	REV	007	017	Because the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will feed them, as a shepherd, and lead them unto living fountains of waters; and God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes.
066	REV	008	001	AND when he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about half an hour.
066	REV	008	002	And I saw the seven angels which stood before God, and there were given to them seven trumpets.
066	REV	008	003	And another angel came, and stood by the altar, holding a golden censer; and there were given to him many perfumes, to offer with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.
066	REV	008	004	And the smoke of the perfumes went up with the prayers of the saints, out of the angel’s hand before God.
066	REV	008	005	And the angel took the censer, and filled it from the fire of the altar, and cast it upon the earth: and there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings, and an earthquake.
066	REV	008	006	And the seven angels holding the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.
066	REV	008	007	And the first angel blew the trumpet, and there were hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast on the earth; and a third part of the trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.
066	REV	008	008	And the second angel sounded, and there was cast into the sea as it were a vast mountain burning with fire: and the third part of the sea became blood;
066	REV	008	009	and a third part of the creatures having life, which are in the sea, died; and a third part of the ships was destroyed.
066	REV	008	010	And the third angel blew the trumpet, and there fell from heaven a great star, burning as a torch, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of water;
066	REV	008	011	and the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters was turned into wormwood, and multitudes of men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.
066	REV	008	012	And the fourth angel sounded, and a third part of the sun was smitten, and a third part of the moon, and a third part of the stars; so that a third part of them was darkened, and the day had no light during a third part of it, and the night likewise.
066	REV	008	013	And I saw and heard one angel flying in the mid-heavens, saying with a loud voice, Wo, wo, wo, to the dwellers upon earth, because of the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three angels, which are ready to sound.
066	REV	009	001	AND the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven to the earth; and to him was given the key of the pit of the abyss of hell.
066	REV	009	002	And he opened the pit of the abyss; and a smoke ascended out of the pit like the smoke of a vast furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke of the pit.
066	REV	009	003	And out of the smoke came forth locusts upon the earth; and power was given to them, such power as the scorpions of the earth possess.
066	REV	009	004	And it was told them, Hurt not the grass of the earth, nor any herb, nor any tree, but only those men who have not the seal of God in their foreheads.
066	REV	009	005	And it was given them in charge that they should not kill these men outright, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment is as the torment of a scorpion when he striketh a man.
066	REV	009	006	And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall earnestly desire to die, and death shall fly from them.
066	REV	009	007	And the figures of the locusts were like horses equipped for war; and upon their heads there were as crowns, like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men.
066	REV	009	008	And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were like the teeth of lions.
066	REV	009	009	And they had breastplates, as breastplates of iron: and the sound of their wings was as the rumbling of chariots of many horses rushing to battle.
066	REV	009	010	And they had tails like scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and they had power to hurt men five months.
066	REV	009	011	And they had over them a king, the angel of the abyss of hell, whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek he is called Appollyon.
066	REV	009	012	One woe is past; and, behold, there are coming yet two woes after these.
066	REV	009	013	And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a great voice from the four horns of the altar of gold which is before God,
066	REV	009	014	saying to the sixth angel who held the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound at the great river Euphrates.
066	REV	009	015	And the four angels were loosed, who were ready at the hour, and day, and month, and year, to kill the third part of mankind.
066	REV	009	016	And the number of the armies of cavalry was two myriads of myriads and I heard the number of them.
066	REV	009	017	And in this manner saw I the horses in the vision, and those who were mounted upon them, having breastplates of the colour of fire, and jacinth, and sulphur; and the horses’ heads were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths proceeded fire and smoke and brimstone.
066	REV	009	018	By these three were slain the third part of mankind, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the sulphur, which proceeded out of their mouths.
066	REV	009	019	For their powers are in their mouth, and in their tails; for their tails are like serpents, having heads, and with them they do hurt.
066	REV	009	020	And the residue of mankind, who were not slain by these plagues, repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship demons, and idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of wood, and of stone: which can neither see nor hear, nor walk:
066	REV	009	021	and they repented not of their murders, nor of their magical arts, nor of their whoredom, nor of their thefts.
066	REV	010	001	AND I saw another mighty angel descending from heaven, clothed with a cloud; and a rainbow on his head, and his countenance as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:
066	REV	010	002	and he held in his hand a little book open; and he placed his right foot on the sea, and his left on the land,
066	REV	010	003	and cried with a loud voice, as a lion roareth: and when he had cried, the seven thunders uttered their voices.
066	REV	010	004	And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Seal up the things, which the seven thunders have spoken, and write them not down.
066	REV	010	005	And the angel which I saw standing upon the sea and upon the land lifted up his hand towards heaven,
066	REV	010	006	and he swore by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created the heaven and the things which are therein, and the earth and the things which are in it, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that time shall be no longer:
066	REV	010	007	but that in the days of the blast of the seventh angel, when he shall sound, then shall the mystery of God be completed, as he spake by his own servants the prophets.
066	REV	010	008	And the voice which I heard out of heaven again spoke to me, and said, Go take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel that standeth upon the sea and upon the land.
066	REV	010	009	And I went up to the angel, saying unto him, Give me that little book. And he saith to me, Take it, and eat it up; and it will make thy belly bitter, though in thy mouth it will be sweet as honey.
066	REV	010	010	And I took the little book out of the angel’s hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth as honey sweet; yet when I had eaten it, my belly was made bitter.
066	REV	010	011	And he said to me, Thou must prophesy again before many people, and nations, and tongues, and monarchs.
066	REV	011	001	AND there was given me a cane like a measuring staff; and the angel stood by, saying, Arise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and those who worship therein.
066	REV	011	002	But the exterior court of the temple leave out, and measure it not; because it is given to the Gentiles: and they shall trample under foot the holy city forty-two months.
066	REV	011	003	And I will give charge to my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.
066	REV	011	004	These are the two olive trees, and the two lamps which stand before the face of the God of the earth.
066	REV	011	005	And if any person attempts to hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any person attempts to injure them, he must thus be slain.
066	REV	011	006	These have power to shut up the heaven, that no rain water the earth during the days of their prophecy: and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to smite the earth with every plague, as often as they will.
066	REV	011	007	And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast which ascendeth out of hell shall make war with them, and shall overcome them, and put them to death.
066	REV	011	008	And their corpses shall be exposed in the streets of the great city, which is called spiritually Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.
066	REV	011	009	And they of the people and tribes and tongues and nations will look upon their corpses three days and half, and they will not permit their corpses to be laid in sepulchres.
066	REV	011	010	And the dwellers upon earth will rejoice over them, and be very glad, and will send gifts to each other; because these two prophets were a torment to those who dwell on the earth.
066	REV	011	011	And after three days and half, the spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood up on their feet; and great terror fell on those who beheld them.
066	REV	011	012	And they heard a great voice out of heaven, saying unto them, Ascend up hither. And they ascended into heaven in a cloud: and their enemies beheld them.
066	REV	011	013	And in the same hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and there were slain in the earthquake seven thousand men of note: and the rest were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.
066	REV	011	014	The second woe is past; behold the third woe is coming quickly.
066	REV	011	015	And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of the world are become our Lord’s, and his Messiah’s, and he shall reign for ever and ever.
066	REV	011	016	And the four and twenty presbyters, who were seated before God upon their thrones, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,
066	REV	011	017	saying, We give thanks to thee, Lord the Almighty God, who is and who was, and who is coming, because thou hast assumed thy great power, and hast set up the throne of thy kingdom.
066	REV	011	018	Though the nations were incensed, yet thy wrath came, and the time of the dead to be judged, and to give the reward to thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and to all who fear thy name, to the small and to the great; and to destroy those who have destroyed the earth.
066	REV	011	019	And the temple of God was opened in the heaven, and there appeared the ark of his covenant in his temple: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and earthquake, and a great hail.
066	REV	012	001	AND there appeared a great sign in the heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:
066	REV	012	002	and being with child, she cried out in travailing pain, and in anguish to be delivered.
066	REV	012	003	And there appeared another sign in the heaven; and lo! a great fiery dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his heads seven crowns.
066	REV	012	004	And his tail drew a third part of the stars of heaven, and cast them on the earth: and the dragon placed himself before the woman who was ready to be delivered, that when she should bring forth, he might devour her babe.
066	REV	012	005	And she brought forth a male child, who should rule the nations with an iron sceptre: and her infant was caught up to God, and his throne.
066	REV	012	006	And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that she might there be fed during a thousand two hundred and sixty days.
066	REV	012	007	Then was there war in the heaven: Michael and his angels warred against the dragon; and the dragon warred and his angels,
066	REV	012	008	and they could not prevail; neither was there any more place found for them in the heaven.
066	REV	012	009	And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, who is called the Devil, and Satan, who deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.
066	REV	012	010	And I heard a great voice saying in the heaven, Now is come the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ; because the accuser of our brethren is cast down, who accused them before our God day and night.
066	REV	012	011	And they have vanquished him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto death.
066	REV	012	012	Therefore be exceeding glad ye heavens, and ye who dwell in them. Wo to the inhabitants of the earth and the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, knowing that he hath but a short time.
066	REV	012	013	And when the dragon saw that he was cast out into the earth, he persecuted the woman which had brought forth the male child.
066	REV	012	014	And there were given to the woman two wings of a great eagle, that she should fly into the wilderness, unto her place, where she is supported there for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.
066	REV	012	015	And the serpent cast out after the woman, from his mouth water, as a river, that he might sweep her away with the flood.
066	REV	012	016	And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth.
066	REV	012	017	And the dragon was incensed against the woman, and went forth to make war against the remnant of her seed, who keep the commandments of God, and hold the testimony of Jesus Christ.
066	REV	013	001	AND I stood upon the sand of the sea, and I saw a beast rising up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon the horns ten diadems, and upon the heads a title of blasphemy.
066	REV	013	002	And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his throne, and great authority.
066	REV	013	003	And I saw one of his heads as if wounded unto death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the earth wondered after the beast.
066	REV	013	004	And they worshipped the dragon who had given authority to the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like to the beast? who is able to wage war with him?
066	REV	013	005	And there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and there was given to him authority to make war forty-two months.
066	REV	013	006	And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven.
066	REV	013	007	And it was given to him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and authority was given to him over every tribe, and tongue, and nation.
066	REV	013	008	And all the inhabitants who dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.
066	REV	013	009	He that hath an ear, let him hear.
066	REV	013	010	If any person leads others into captivity, he shall be led into captivity; if any person kills with the sword, he must be slain by the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.
066	REV	013	011	And I saw another beast rising up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb, though he spake as the dragon.
066	REV	013	012	And he exerciseth all the authority of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth, and those who inhabit therein, to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was healed.
066	REV	013	013	And he performeth great signs, so that he even causeth fire to come down from heaven to the earth, in the sight of men,
066	REV	013	014	and deceiveth the inhabitants of the earth by the signs, which he is enabled to perform before the beast, saying to the dwellers upon the earth, that they should make an image for the beast who had the stroke of the sword, and survived.
066	REV	013	015	And he is enabled to impart life to the image of the beast that even the image of the beast should speak, and cause as many as will not worship the image of the beast to be put to death.
066	REV	013	016	And he causeth all the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the freemen and the slaves, to receive a brand upon their right hand, and upon their foreheads:
066	REV	013	017	and that no man may buy or sell, but he that hath the mark impressed, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
066	REV	013	018	Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding calculate the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred sixty-six.
066	REV	014	001	AND I saw, and lo, a lamb stood upon the mount Zion, and with him an hundred forty-four thousand, having the name of his Father inscribed on their foreheads.
066	REV	014	002	And I heard a voice from heaven, as the sound of many waters, and as the roar of loud thunder; and I heard the sound of harpers harping on their harps:
066	REV	014	003	and they sang as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four living beings, and the presbyters: and no person could learn that song, but the hundred forty-four thousand, who were redeemed from the earth.
066	REV	014	004	These are they who have not defiled themselves with women; for they are virgins: these are they who follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth: these have been redeemed among men, as first-fruits to God, and to the Lamb.
066	REV	014	005	And in their mouth no guile is found; for they are blameless before the throne of God.
066	REV	014	006	And I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach the glad tidings to the inhabitants of the earth, to every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people,
066	REV	014	007	saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give him glory; for the hour of his judgment is come; and worship him that made the heaven and the earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.
066	REV	014	008	And another angel followed, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because all nations have been made to drink of the wine of the wrath of her whoredom.
066	REV	014	009	And a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any person worship the beast, and his image, and receive the brand upon his forehead, and upon his right hand,
066	REV	014	010	he also shall drink of the wine of the fury of God, which is mixed undiluted with water in the cup of his wrath; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:
066	REV	014	011	and the smoke of their torment ascendeth for ever and ever: and they have no respite day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the brand of his name.
066	REV	014	012	Here is the patience of the saints: here are they who keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.
066	REV	014	013	And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Write, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord, from henceforward: yea, saith the Spirit, that they may have rest from their labours; but their works follow after them.
066	REV	014	014	And I saw, and, lo! a white cloud, and upon the cloud sat one like to a son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.
066	REV	014	015	And anther angel came forth out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat upon the cloud, Put in thy sickle, and reap: for the hour is come for thee to reap; because the harvest of the earth is fully ripe.
066	REV	014	016	And he who sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle upon the earth, and the earth was reaped.
066	REV	014	017	And another angel came forth out of the temple which is in heaven, having also himself a sharp sickle.
066	REV	014	018	And another angel came forth from the altar, having authority over fire; and he cried with a loud voice to him who held the sharp sickle, saying, Put in thy sharp sickle, and gather the bunches of the vine of the earth; for her clusters are ripe.
066	REV	014	019	And the angel thrust in his sickle upon the earth, and gathered the grapes of the vine of the earth, and cast them into the great winepress of the wrath of God.
066	REV	014	020	And the wine-press was trodden without the city, and blood issued from the wine-press, as high as the horses’ bridles, for the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs.
066	REV	015	001	AND I saw another sign in the heaven, great and wonderful, seven angels having the seven last plagues because by them is the wrath of God completely executed.
066	REV	015	002	And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire; and those who had obtained the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name standing upon the sea of glass, holding the harps of God.
066	REV	015	003	And they sung the sacred ode of Moses the servant of the Lord, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works, O Lord God Almighty; righteous and true are thy ways, O King of saints.
066	REV	015	004	Who should not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? because thou only art holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee, because thy righteous judgments are made evident.
066	REV	015	005	And after these things I beheld, and, lo! the temple of the tabernacle of witness in heaven was opened:
066	REV	015	006	and the seven angels having the seven plagues came forth out of the temple, clothed in linen white and shining, and girded about the breasts with golden girdles.
066	REV	015	007	And one of the four living beings gave unto the seven angels seven golden vases full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever.
066	REV	015	008	And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no person was able to enter into the temple, until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completely executed.
066	REV	016	001	AND I heard a loud voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels, Go and pour out the vases of the wrath of God upon the earth.
066	REV	016	002	And the first angel went, and poured out his vase upon the earth; and there came an ulcer malignant and painful upon the men that had the brand of the beast, and upon those who worshipped his image.
066	REV	016	003	And the second angel poured his vase upon the sea and it became blood as of a dead man: and every living creature died in the sea.
066	REV	016	004	And the third angel poured out his vase upon the rivers and upon the fountains of waters; and they became blood.
066	REV	016	005	And I heard the angel of the waters saying, Righteous art thou, O Lord, who art, and who wast, even the holy one, because thou hast judged these things.
066	REV	016	006	For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.
066	REV	016	007	And I heard another angel from the altar saying, Yea, Lord God Almighty, true and just are thy judgments.
066	REV	016	008	And the fourth angel poured out his vase upon the sun; and there was given to it a charge to burn men with fire.
066	REV	016	009	And the men were scorched with a fierce heat, and they blasphemed the name of God, who had power over these plagues: and they repented not, to give him glory.
066	REV	016	010	And the fifth angel poured out his vase upon the throne of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness, and they gnawed their own tongues from anguish,
066	REV	016	011	and they blasphemed the God of heaven, in the midst of their anguish, and of their ulcers, and repented not of their works.
066	REV	016	012	And the sixth angel poured out his vase upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings who come from the rising of the sun might be prepared.
066	REV	016	013	And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs.
066	REV	016	014	For they are the spirits of demons doing wonders, which go forth unto the kings of the earth, and of the whole habitable globe, to gather them together unto the battle of that great day of God Almighty.
066	REV	016	015	Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he who watcheth, and keepeth his garments, that he walk not about naked, and men see his shame.
066	REV	016	016	And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew, Armageddon.
066	REV	016	017	And the seventh angel poured out his vase into the air; and a loud voice come out from the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.
066	REV	016	018	And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not from the day that men were upon the earth, an earthquake of such a kind, and so great.
066	REV	016	019	And the great city was cleft into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and Babylon the great came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fury of his wrath.
066	REV	016	020	And every island fled, and the mountains were no more found.
066	REV	016	021	And a great storm of hail, each about a talent weight, fell from heaven upon men: and men blasphemed God for the plague of hail: for great was the plague of it, exceedingly great.
066	REV	017	001	AND one of the seven angels who had the seven vases, came to me, and talked with me, saying to me, Come hither, I will shew thee the judgment of the great harlot, who sitteth upon many waters:
066	REV	017	002	with whom the kings of the earth have committed whoredom, and all the inhabitants of the world have intoxicated themselves with the wine of her whoredom.
066	REV	017	003	And he bore me away in spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads, and ten horns.
066	REV	017	004	And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and all over decked with gold, precious stones, and pearls, holding a golden cup in her hand, full of abominations and of the impurity of her whoredom.
066	REV	017	005	And upon her forehead was there a name written, Mystery, Babylon the great, the mother or harlots, and of the abominations of the earth.
066	REV	017	006	And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great amazement.
066	REV	017	007	And the angel said unto me, Wherefore dost thou wonder? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast which carrieth her, which hath seven heads and ten horns.
066	REV	017	008	The beast which thou seest was, and is not; and shall come up out of the abyss of hell, and shall go into perdition: and the dwellers upon earth will wonder, (whose names are not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, ) when they shall see the beast which was, and is not, though he is.
066	REV	017	009	Here is the mind that hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, where the woman is seated even upon them.
066	REV	017	010	And these are seven kings: five have fallen, and the one exists, the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must abide but a little while.
066	REV	017	011	And the beast which was, and is not, though he is himself the eighth, yet is of the seven, and shall go away into perdition.
066	REV	017	012	And the ten horns which thou sawest, are ten kings, who have not yet received their kingdoms; but will receive authority as kings for one hour with the beast.
066	REV	017	013	They hold one sentiment, and will give their own power and authority to the beast.
066	REV	017	014	They shall make war against the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: because he is Lord of lords, and King of kings and they that are with him, are called, and elect, and faithful.
066	REV	017	015	And he saith to me, The waters which thou sawest, on which the whore sat, are people, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.
066	REV	017	016	And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, they shall hate the whore, and make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and shall burn her up with fire.
066	REV	017	017	For God hath put it into their hearts to do his will, to perform one purpose, even to give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God are fulfilled.
066	REV	017	018	And the woman which thou sawest is the great city, which holds dominion over the kings of the earth.
066	REV	018	001	AND after these things I saw an angel descending from heaven, having great authority; and the earth was enlightened by his glory.
066	REV	018	002	And he cried mightily with a great voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of demons, and the hold of every impure spirit, and the cage of every unclean and hateful bird.
066	REV	018	003	Because all nations have drunk of the wine of the rage of her whoredom, and the kings of the earth have committed whoredom with her, and the merchants of the earth have been enriched by the excess of her profligate luxury.
066	REV	018	004	And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come forth out of her, my people, that ye have no share in her sins, and that so ye may not receive of her plagues.
066	REV	018	005	For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.
066	REV	018	006	Render to her as she also hath done to you, and repay her double according to her works; in the cup which she hath mingled mingle for her double.
066	REV	018	007	As much as she hath glorified herself, and rioted in luxury, so much torment and sorrow give her: because she hath said in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.
066	REV	018	008	Therefore in one hour shall all her plagues come, death, and mourning, and famine: and she shall be consumed with fire; because mighty is the Lord God, who judgeth her.
066	REV	018	009	And the kings of the earth who have committed whoredom with her, and shared in her luxuries, shall bewail her, and lament bitterly over her, when they see the smoke of her burning,
066	REV	018	010	standing afar off through terror of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that strong city! how in one hour is thy judgment come upon thee!
066	REV	018	011	And the merchants of the earth wept and wailed over her: because no man buyeth their merchandise any more:
066	REV	018	012	the merchandise of gold and of silver, and of precious stones, and of pearl, and of fine linen, and of purple, and of silk, and of scarlet, and every sweet scented wood, and every ivory vessel, and every vessel of most precious wood, and of gold, and of iron, and of marble,
066	REV	018	013	and cinnamon, and perfumes, and myrrh, and libanum, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and cattle, and sheep, and of horses, and of chariots, and of bodies, and the souls of men.
066	REV	018	014	And the delicate autumnal fruit of thy soul’s earner longing is gone from thee, and all things that are dainty and that are splendid are departed from thee, and never shalt thou find them any more.
066	REV	018	015	The merchants of these things who enriched themselves by her, shall stand afar off through terror of her torment, weeping and wailing,
066	REV	018	016	and saying, Alas, alas, the great city, which was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and overlaid with gold, and precious stones, and pearls! how in one hour is so great wealth laid waste!
066	REV	018	017	And every pilot, and all the crew in the ships, and the mariners, and as many as exercise their labours on the sea, stood afar off,
066	REV	018	018	and cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What is like that great city!
066	REV	018	019	And they cast dust upon their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, by which all who occupied ships on the sea were enriched from her opulence! how in one hour is she made desolate!
066	REV	018	020	Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye the holy apostles and prophets, for God hath adjudged her to punishment, for the judgment inflicted on you by her.
066	REV	018	021	And a mighty angel took up a stone as a great milestone, and cast it into the sea, saying, So with rapidity shall the great city Babylon be hurled into the deep, and never shall be found more.
066	REV	018	022	And the sound of harpers, and musicians, and flute players, and trumpeters, shall never be heard in thee more; and no artificer of whatever trade shall be found in thee any more; and the sound of a milstone shall be heard in thee no more;
066	REV	018	023	and never shall the light of a lamp shine in thee any more; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard in thee no more: because thy merchants were the grandees of the earth; because all nations were deluded by thy magical incantation.
066	REV	018	024	And in her was found the blood of prophets, and holy men, and of all who have been slaughtered upon the earth.
066	REV	019	001	AND after these things I heard a loud sound as of a vast multitude in heaven, saying, Hallelujah: Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power be to the Lord our God:
066	REV	019	002	because true and righteous are his judgments; for he hath judged the great harlot, that corrupted the earth with her whoredom, and hath avenged the blood of his servants shed by her hand.
066	REV	019	003	And the second time they said, Hallelujah. And her smoke ascended up for ever and ever.
066	REV	019	004	And the four and twenty presbyters fell prostrate, and the four living beings, and they worshipped God who was seated on the throne, saying, Amen; Hallelujah.
066	REV	019	005	And there came a voice out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye servants of his, and all that fear him, both the small and the great.
066	REV	019	006	And I heard as it were the voice of a vast multitude, and as the noise of many waters, and as the roar of mighty thunderings, saying, Hallelujah: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.
066	REV	019	007	Let us rejoice and exult, and give him glory: because the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his bride hath made herself ready.
066	REV	019	008	And it was granted her to be clothed in fine linen, clean and splendid: for the fine linen is the emblem of the righteousness of the saints.
066	REV	019	009	And he said to me, Write, Blessed are they that are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he said to me, These are the true sayings of God.
066	REV	019	010	And I fell down before his feet to worship him: and he said unto me, See thou dost not so: I am thy fellow-servant, and of thy brethren who hold the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the spirit of prophecy is the testimony of Jesus.
066	REV	019	011	And I saw heaven opened, and lo a white horse; and he that sat upon it, is called Faithful and True, and with righteousness doth he judge and make war.
066	REV	019	012	And his eyes were as a flame of fire, and upon his head were many diadems; and he hath a name inscribed which no man knoweth but himself.
066	REV	019	013	And he was clothed in a garment dipt in blood, and his name is styled the word of God.
066	REV	019	014	And the hosts which are in heaven followed him on white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.
066	REV	019	015	And out of his mouth proceeded a sharp sword, that therewith he may smite the heathen and he will rule them with an iron sceptre: and he will tread the wine-press of the fury and of the wrath of God Almighty.
066	REV	019	016	And he hath upon his vesture and upon his thigh this name written, king of kings, and lord of lords.
066	REV	019	017	And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls which fly in the midst of heaven, Come hither and flock together unto the supper of the great God:
066	REV	019	018	that ye may eat the carcasses of kings, and the carcasses of military commanders, and the carcasses of mighty men, and the carcasses of horses, and of those who ride upon them, and the carcasses of all, freemen and slaves, both small and great.
066	REV	019	019	And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war with him that was sitting upon the horse, and with his army.
066	REV	019	020	And the beast was seized upon, and with him the false prophet who performed the wonders before him, by which he deceived those who received the brand of the beast, and those who worshipped his image. They were both hurled alive into the lake of fire which burneth with brimstone.
066	REV	019	021	And all the rest were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which issued from his mouth: and all the fowls were gorged with their carcasses.
066	REV	020	001	AND I saw an angel descending from heaven, having the key of the abyss of hell, and a great chain in his hand:
066	REV	020	002	and he seized on the dragon, the old serpent, which is the devil and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,
066	REV	020	003	and cast him into the abyss, and shut him up, and put a seal upon it, that he might deceive the nations no more until the thousand years are completed: and after that he must be loosed a short time.
066	REV	020	004	And I saw thrones, and persons were seated upon them, and authority to judge was given to them: and I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus, and for the word of God, and who had not worshipped the beast, nor his image, and had not received the brand in their foreheads, and upon their right hand; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.
066	REV	020	005	But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years are completed. This is the first resurrection.
066	REV	020	006	Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection; over these the second death hath no dominion: but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and they shall reign with him a thousand years.
066	REV	020	007	And when the thousand years shall be completed, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison;
066	REV	020	008	and he shall go forth to deceive the nations that are in the four corners of the earth, Gog, and Magog, to gather them together to battle, whose number is as the sand of the sea.
066	REV	020	009	And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and encircled the camp of the saints, and the beloved city: and there came down fire from God out of heaven, and devoured them up.
066	REV	020	010	And the devil who deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and they shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.
066	REV	020	011	And I saw a great white throne, and one sat upon it, from whose presence fled the earth and the heaven, and no place was found for them.
066	REV	020	012	And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and the books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of the things written in the books according to their works.
066	REV	020	013	And the sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and the grave gave up the dead that were in them; and every one was judged according to his works.
066	REV	020	014	And death and the grave were cast into the lake of fire: this is the second death.
066	REV	020	015	And if any one was not found inscribed on the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire.
066	REV	021	001	AND I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.
066	REV	021	002	And I John saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, descending from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
066	REV	021	003	And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, Behold the tabernacle of God is with men, and he shall pitch his tent with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, their own God.
066	REV	021	004	And God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more; nor shall mourning, nor crying, nor toil be any more: because the former things are passed away.
066	REV	021	005	And he that sat upon the throne said, Lo! I make all things new: and he said unto me, Write that these sayings are true and faithful.
066	REV	021	006	And he said to me, It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end; I will give to him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.
066	REV	021	007	He that overcometh shall inherit all things, and I will be to him a God, and he shall be to me a son.
066	REV	021	008	But to those who shrink back through fear, and to the infidels, and to the abominable, and to murderers, and to whoremongers, and to those who use magical incantations, and to idolaters, and to all liars, is their portion appointed in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone; which is the second death.
066	REV	021	009	And there came to me one of the seven angels who held the seven vases full of the seven last plagues, and he talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb’s wife.
066	REV	021	010	And he bore me away in spirit unto a great and exceeding high mountain, and shewed me the great city, the holy Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,
066	REV	021	011	having the glory of God: and her brilliance was like the most precious gem, as a jasper stone, transparent as crystal;
066	REV	021	012	and she had a great wall and lofty, having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names inscribed on them, which are those of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel.
066	REV	021	013	From the east three gates; from the north three gates; from the south three gates; from the west three gates.
066	REV	021	014	And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
066	REV	021	015	And he that talked with me held a golden cane to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.
066	REV	021	016	And the city is a quadrangle, and the breadth of it is just as much as the length of it; and he measured the city with the cane, twelve thousand furlongs: the breadth, and the length, and the height of it, are exactly proportioned.
066	REV	021	017	He measured also the wall of it a hundred and forty-four cubits, according to the measure of a man, for such is that of an angel.
066	REV	021	018	The structure of the wall of it was jasper, and the city pure gold, like clear glass.
066	REV	021	019	And the foundations of the walls of the city were adorned with every precious stone: the first foundation a jasper; the second a sapphire; the third a chalcedony; the fourth an emerald;
066	REV	021	020	the fifth a sardonyx; the sixth a sardius; the seventh a chrysolite; the eighth a beryl; the ninth a topaz; the tenth a chrysoprasus; the eleventh a jacinth; the twelfth an amethyst.
066	REV	021	021	And the twelve gates were twelve several pearls; every one of the gates was of one pearl; and the street of the city was pure gold, as transparent glass.
066	REV	021	022	And I saw no temple therein; for the Lord God Almighty is the temple thereof, even the Lamb.
066	REV	021	023	And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon to shine upon it: for the glory of God illuminates it, and the Lamb is the lamp thereof.
066	REV	021	024	And the nations of those that are saved shall walk about in the light thereof; and the kings of the earth shall bring their glory and their honour into it;
066	REV	021	025	and her gates shall be never shut by day (for there is no night there);
066	REV	021	026	and they shall bring the glory and the honour of the nations into it.
066	REV	021	027	And there shall no more enter into it any thing unclean, or that practises abomination and lying; but only those who are written in the book of life of the Lamb.
066	REV	022	001	AND he shewed me a clear river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.
066	REV	022	002	In the midst of the street of it, even on this side, and on that of the river, grew the tree of life, producing twelve crops of fruit, and ripening its fruit in succession every month; and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.
066	REV	022	003	And no accursed thing is there any more; and the throne of God and of the Lamb are in it, and his servants will pay divine worship to him.
066	REV	022	004	And they shall see his face; and his name shall be on their foreheads.
066	REV	022	005	And there shall be no night there, and they have no need of a lamp, or the light of the sun; because the Lord God illumines them: and they shall reign for ever and ever.
066	REV	022	006	And he said to me, These words are faithful and true. And the Lord God of the holy prophets hath sent his angel to shew to his servants the things which must shortly come to pass.
066	REV	022	007	Behold, I come quickly! blessed is he that observeth the words of the prophecy of this book.
066	REV	022	008	And I John saw and heard these things. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who shewed me these things.
066	REV	022	009	And he said to me, See thou do it not; for I am a fellow-servant of thine, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of those who observe the words of this book: worship God.
066	REV	022	010	And he said to me, Seal not up the words of the prophecy of this book; for the time is at hand.
066	REV	022	011	He that is unjust, let him be unjust still; and he that is filthy, let him be filthy still; and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still; and he that is holy, let him be holy still.
066	REV	022	012	And behold, I come quickly: and my reward is with me, to give to every man as his work shall be.
066	REV	022	013	I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.
066	REV	022	014	Blessed are they who keep his commandments, that they may have authority to approach unto the tree of life, and that they may enter in by the gates into the city.
066	REV	022	015	But without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and every one who loveth and maketh a lie.
066	REV	022	016	I Jesus have sent my angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, the bright and morning star.
066	REV	022	017	And the spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him who is athirst come: and whosoever is desirous, let him take of the water of life freely.
066	REV	022	018	For I testify to every one who heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man add to these things, God will lay upon him the plagues that are written in this book:
066	REV	022	019	and if any take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the book of life, and from the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.
066	REV	022	020	He that testifieth these things saith, Verily, I come quickly. Amen. Yea come, Lord Jesus!
066	REV	022	021	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen THE END.
