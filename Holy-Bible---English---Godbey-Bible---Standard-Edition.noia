# BOOK	040	MAT	Matthew	Matthew
040	MAT	001	001	The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
040	MAT	001	002	Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judah and his brothers;
040	MAT	001	003	And Judah begat Phares and Zara from Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;
040	MAT	001	004	and Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;
040	MAT	001	005	and Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;
040	MAT	001	006	and Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her who was the wife of Uriah;
040	MAT	001	007	and Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;
040	MAT	001	008	and Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; Joram begat Hozias;
040	MAT	001	009	Hozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; Achaz begat Hezekiah;
040	MAT	001	010	and Hezekiah begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josiah;
040	MAT	001	011	and Josiah begat Jechonias and his brothers in the captivity of Babylon.
040	MAT	001	012	And after the captivity of Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorababbel;
040	MAT	001	013	Zorababbel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;
040	MAT	001	014	and Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Acheim; Acheim begat Eliud;
040	MAT	001	015	and Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;
040	MAT	001	016	and Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, from whom Jesus, who is called Christ, was born.
040	MAT	001	017	Therefore all the generations from Abraham unto David are fourteen generations; from David unto the captivity of Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the captivity of Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.
040	MAT	001	018	The birth of Jesus Christ was thus: His mother Mary, having been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, was found having gestation from the Holy Ghost.
040	MAT	001	019	And Joseph her husband, being righteous and not wishing to expose her publicly, determined to send her away secretly.
040	MAT	001	020	And he meditating on these things, behold an angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying; Joseph, son of David, do not fear to receive Mary thy wife; for that which is begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit;
040	MAT	001	021	she shall bring forth a son; and thou shalt call his name Jesus; for He will save His people from their sins.
040	MAT	001	022	And all this took place in order that the Word, having been spoken by the Lord through the prophet, might be fulfilled, saying;
040	MAT	001	023	Behold, the virgin shall have gestation and bring forth a son, and they will call his name Emmanuel, which is interpreted, God is with us.
040	MAT	001	024	And Joseph rising from sleep did as the angel of the Lord commanded him;
040	MAT	001	025	and he took his wife to himself, and did not know her until she brought forth a son, and called his name Jesus.
040	MAT	002	001	Jesus having been born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came into Jerusalem saying;
040	MAT	002	002	Where is He that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen His star in the east, and have come to worship Him-
040	MAT	002	003	And Herod the king having heard, was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him,
040	MAT	002	004	and gathering together all the chief priests and scribes, inquired with them where Christ should be born.
040	MAT	002	005	And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judea; for thus it has been written by the prophet;
040	MAT	002	006	And thou, Bethlehem, the land of Judea, art by no means the least among the princes of Judah; for out of thee shall come a leader, who will shepherd my people, Israel.
040	MAT	002	007	Then Herod secretly calling the wise men, inquired with them the time of the appearing of the star,
040	MAT	002	008	and sending them to Bethlehem he said; Having gone search diligently for the young child; and when you may find Him, notify me, in order that I, having gone, may worship Him also.
040	MAT	002	009	And hearing the king they departed, and, behold, the star which they saw in the east went before them, until having come, it stood above where the young child was.
040	MAT	002	010	And seeing the star they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.
040	MAT	002	011	And having come into the house they saw the young child with Mary His mother, and having fallen down they worshiped Him, and opening their treasures they offered Him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.
040	MAT	002	012	And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed into their own country by another way.
040	MAT	002	013	And they having gone away, behold, the angel of the Lord appears in a dream to Joseph, saying; Having arisen, take the young child and His mother, and fly into Egypt; and be thou there until I may speak to thee; for Herod is about to seek the young child in order to destroy Him.
040	MAT	002	014	And having arisen, he took with him the young child and His mother by night and departed into Egypt;
040	MAT	002	015	and was there until the death of Herod: in order that the Word, having been spoken by the Lord through the prophet, might be fulfilled, saying; Out of Egypt have I called my son.
040	MAT	002	016	Then Herod, seeing that he was mocked by the wise men, became exceedingly angry; and having sent forth, he slew all the boys in Bethlehem and in all its boundaries, from two years old and under, according to the time which he inquired with the wise men.
040	MAT	002	017	Then the word having been spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying:
040	MAT	002	018	A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation and weeping and great mourning; Rachel weeping for her children; and was not willing to be comforted, because they are not.
040	MAT	002	019	And Herod having died, behold, the angel of the Lord appears to Joseph in Egypt in a dream, saying;
040	MAT	002	020	Having arisen, take with you the young child and His mother, and depart into the land of Israel; for those seeking the life of the young child are dead.
040	MAT	002	021	And having arisen he took with him the young child and His mother and came into the land of Israel.
040	MAT	002	022	And having heard that Archelaus reigns over Judea instead of Herod his father, he was afraid to depart thither; and being warned in a dream he departed into the regions of Galilee.
040	MAT	002	023	And having come, he went down into the city called Nazareth, in order that the words spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled, that He shall be called a Nazarene.
040	MAT	003	001	In those days comes John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judea,
040	MAT	003	002	saying, Repent ye, for the kingdom of the heavens is at hand.
040	MAT	003	003	This is the one, who is spoken of by Isaiah the prophet saying, The voice of one roaring in the wilderness; Prepare ye the way of the Lord; make straight His paths.
040	MAT	003	004	And the same John had his raiment from camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his food was locusts and wild honey.
040	MAT	003	005	Then Jerusalem and all Judea, and all the region about the Jordan, were coming out to him,
040	MAT	003	006	and were being baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
040	MAT	003	007	And seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said unto them; O generations of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
040	MAT	003	008	Therefore bring forth fruit worthy of repentance;
040	MAT	003	009	and think not to say among yourselves; We have Abraham, our father; for I say unto you that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.
040	MAT	003	010	But already the ax is laid to the root of the trees; therefore every tree not producing good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire.
040	MAT	003	011	I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but there is One coming after me more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry; He will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and fire.
040	MAT	003	012	Whose fan is in His hand, and He will thoroughly purify His threshing-floor, and gather His wheat into the garner, and will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.
040	MAT	003	013	Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, in order to be baptized by him.
040	MAT	003	014	And John continued to forbid Him saying, I have need to be baptized by thee, and comest thou unto me?
040	MAT	003	015	And Jesus responding said to him; Suffer it now; for thus it is becoming us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffers Him.
040	MAT	003	016	And Jesus having been baptized, came up straightway from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened and He saw the Spirit of God, descending like a dove, coming on Him.
040	MAT	003	017	And behold, a voice from the heavens, saying; This is my beloved Son in whom I delight.
040	MAT	004	001	Then Jesus was led up into the wilderness by the Spirit, to be tempted by the devil.
040	MAT	004	002	And having fasted forty days and forty nights, He afterward hungered.
040	MAT	004	003	And the tempter having come to Him, said; If thou art the Son of God, speak in order that these stones may become bread.
040	MAT	004	004	And He responding said; It has been written, A man shall not live upon bread alone, but upon every word coming forth through the mouth of God.
040	MAT	004	005	Then the devil takes Him into the holy city and stood Him on the pinnacle of the temple,
040	MAT	004	006	and says to Him; If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down; for it has been written, That He will give His angels charge concerning thee, and upon their hand they will bear thee, lest thou mayest dash thy foot against a stone.
040	MAT	004	007	Jesus said to him; Again it has been written, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.
040	MAT	004	008	Again the devil takes Him into an exceedingly high mountain, and shows Him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of the same,
040	MAT	004	009	and said to Him; All these things will I give unto thee,
040	MAT	004	010	If having fallen down thou mayest worship me: then Jesus says to him, Get behind me, Satan; for it has been written; Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.
040	MAT	004	011	Then the devil leaveth Him; and behold, the angels came to Him and continued to minister unto Him.
040	MAT	004	012	And Jesus having heard that John was cast into prison, departed into Galilee.
040	MAT	004	013	And having left Nazareth, having come into Capernaum, by the seaside, in the borders of Zabulon and Naphtali, He dwelt there;
040	MAT	004	014	in order that the word having been spoken by Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, saying,
040	MAT	004	015	Thou land Zabulon and land Naphtali, way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles,
040	MAT	004	016	the people sitting in darkness saw a great light, and to those sitting in the valley and shadow of death, light sprang up.
040	MAT	004	017	From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent; for the kingdom of the heavens draweth nigh.
040	MAT	004	018	And He walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting their net into the sea; for they were fishers.
040	MAT	004	019	And He says to them, Follow after me, and I will make you fishers of men.
040	MAT	004	020	And immediately, having left their nets, they followed Him.
040	MAT	004	021	And going forth from thence, He saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and He called them.
040	MAT	004	022	And immediately having left the ship and their father, they followed Him.
040	MAT	004	023	And Jesus was going round all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every malady among the people.
040	MAT	004	024	And His fame went forth into all Syria: and they brought Him all who were sick, afflicted with various diseases and torments, and the demonized, and the lunatics, and the paralytics; and He healed them.
040	MAT	004	025	And many multitudes followed Him from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and beyond the Jordan.
040	MAT	005	001	And seeing the multitudes, He went up into the mountain; and having sat down, His disciples came to Him.
040	MAT	005	002	And having opened His mouth He taught them, saying;
040	MAT	005	003	Blessed are the poor in spirit: because the kingdom of the heavens is theirs.
040	MAT	005	004	Blessed are the meek, because they shall inherit the earth.
040	MAT	005	005	Blessed are they that mourn: because they shall be comforted.
040	MAT	005	006	Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness: because they shall be filled.
040	MAT	005	007	Blessed are the merciful: because they shall receive mercy.
040	MAT	005	008	Blessed are the pure in heart: because they shall see God.
040	MAT	005	009	Blessed are the peacemakers: because they shall be called the sons of God.
040	MAT	005	010	Blessed are they, who are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for the kingdom of the heavens is theirs.
040	MAT	005	011	Blessed are ye when they may despise you, and shall persecute you, and may say all evil against you, falsifying, for my sake.
040	MAT	005	012	Rejoice, and he exceedingly glad: because your reward is great in the heavens: for in this manner they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
040	MAT	005	013	Ye are the salt of the earth; and if the salt may lose its savor, in what shall it be salted? It is yet without value, except having been cast out, to be trodden under feet by the people.
040	MAT	005	014	Ye are the light of the world. A city sitting on a mountain is unable to be hidden.
040	MAT	005	015	Neither do they light a candle, and place it under a bushel, but on the candlestick; and it shineth to all who are in the house.
040	MAT	005	016	Let your light so shine before the people, in order that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in the heavens.
040	MAT	005	017	Think not that I came to destroy the law of the prophets: I came not to destroy, but to fulfill.
040	MAT	005	018	For truly I say unto you, Until heaven and earth may pass away, one jot or tittle can not pass from the law, until all things may be accomplished.
040	MAT	005	019	Therefore if any one may break one of the least of these commandments, and so teach the people, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of the heavens: but whosoever may do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of the heavens.
040	MAT	005	020	For I say unto you, that if your righteousness may not abound more than that of the scribes and Pharisees, you can not enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
040	MAT	005	021	You have heard that it was said to the ancients, Thou shalt not murder; and whosoever may murder shall be in danger of the judgment;
040	MAT	005	022	but I say unto you that every one being angry with his brother, shall be in danger of the judgment; and whosoever may say to his brother, Thou scoundrel, shall be in danger of the council; and whosoever may say, Thou fool, shall be liable unto a hell of fire.
040	MAT	005	023	Therefore if you may bring your gift to the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you,
040	MAT	005	024	leave there your gift before the altar, and go, first be reconciled to your brother, then having come offer your gift.
040	MAT	005	025	Be reconciled with your adversary quickly, while you are in the way with him; lest the adversary may deliver you to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you may be cast into prison.
040	MAT	005	026	Truly I say unto you, You can not go out from thence until you have paid the last farthing.
040	MAT	005	027	You have heard that it was said, Thou shalt not commit adultery.
040	MAT	005	028	But I say unto you that every one looking on a woman in order to lust after her hath already committed adultery with her in his heart.
040	MAT	005	029	And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable to thee that one of thy members may perish, and not that thy whole body may go away into hell.
040	MAT	005	031	And it was said, Whosoever may send away his wife, let him give her a divorcement.
040	MAT	005	032	But I say unto you, that every one sending away his wife, except on account of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever may marry her who has been cast off commits adultery.
040	MAT	005	033	Again you have heard that it was said to the ancients, Thou shalt not swear falsely, but shall perform unto the Lord thine oaths.
040	MAT	005	034	But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven, because it is the throne of God;
040	MAT	005	035	nor by the earth, because it is the footstool of His feet; neither by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King.
040	MAT	005	036	Neither swear by thy head, because thou art unable to make one hair white or black.
040	MAT	005	037	But let your speech be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay; but that which aboundeth more than these is of the evil one.
040	MAT	005	038	You have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.
040	MAT	005	039	But I say unto you, Resist not him that is evil: but whosoever smites thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also:
040	MAT	005	040	to him wishing to prosecute thee at law, and take away thy coat, let him have the cloak also.
040	MAT	005	041	Whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him two.
040	MAT	005	042	Give to the one asking thee, and do not turn away from the one wishing to borrow from thee.
040	MAT	005	043	You have heard that it was said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy.
040	MAT	005	044	But I say unto you, Love your enemies with a divine love, bless those who curse you and pray for those who despitefully use you and persecute you:
040	MAT	005	045	in order that you may be the sons of your Father who is in the heavens: because He raises up His sun on the wicked and on the good, and rains on the righteous and on the unrighteous.
040	MAT	005	046	For if you love those that love you, what reward have ye? because the publicans also do the same.
040	MAT	005	047	If you salute your brethren only, what do ye more abundantly? do not the heathens also the same thing?
040	MAT	005	048	Therefore ye shall be perfect, as your Father who is in heaven is perfect.
040	MAT	006	001	But take heed that you do not your righteousness before the people, in order to be seen by them: else you have no reward with your Father who is in the heavens:
040	MAT	006	002	therefore when you may do alms, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, in order that they may be glorified by the people: truly I say unto you, They exhaust their reward.
040	MAT	006	003	But thou doing alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:
040	MAT	006	004	in order that thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father who sees in secret will reward thee openly.
040	MAT	006	005	And when you pray, be not like the hypocrites: because they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, in order that they may appear unto the people. Truly I say unto you, They exhaust their reward.
040	MAT	006	006	But when thou mayest pray, enter into thy closet, and having closed thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret, and thy Father who seeth in secret will reward thee openly.
040	MAT	006	007	And praying do not use vain repetitions as the heathen do: for they think they shall be heard in their much speaking.
040	MAT	006	008	Therefore be not like unto them: for your Father knows of what things you have need, before you ask him.
040	MAT	006	009	Therefore pray ye after this manner: Our Father who art in the heavens, let thy name be hallowed:
040	MAT	006	010	let thy kingdom come: let thy will be done, as in heaven, even so upon earth:
040	MAT	006	011	give us this day our daily bread:
040	MAT	006	012	and forgive us our debts, as we have also forgiven our debtors:
040	MAT	006	013	lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.
040	MAT	006	014	For if you may not forgive the people their trespasses, your heavenly Father will not forgive you:
040	MAT	006	015	and if you do not forgive the people, your Father will not forgive you your trespasses.
040	MAT	006	016	And when you may fast, be not like the hypocrites, of a sad contenance: for they disfigure their faces, in order that they may appear unto the people fasting. Truly I say unto you, They exhaust their reward.
040	MAT	006	017	But thou, fasting, anoint thy head, and wash thy face;
040	MAT	006	018	in order that thou mayest not appear unto the people fasting, but to thy Father who is in secret: and thy Father, who seeth in secret, will reward thee openly.
040	MAT	006	019	Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where moth and rust corrupt, and thieves break through and steal:
040	MAT	006	020	but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not corrupt, and thieves do not break through and steal:
040	MAT	006	021	for where your treasure is, there will be your heart also.
040	MAT	006	022	For the light of the body is the eye. If thine eye may be clear, thy whole body will he lighted.
040	MAT	006	023	If thine eye may be bad, thy whole body will be dark. Then if the light which is in you is darkness, the darkness is so great.
040	MAT	006	024	No one is able to serve two masters: for he will hate the one, and love the other; or cleave to the one, and despise the other. You are not able to serve God and mammon.
040	MAT	006	025	Therefore I say unto you, Be not solicitous for your soul what you may eat, nor for your body what you may put on. Is not your soul more valuable than food, and your body than raiment?
040	MAT	006	026	Look unto the fowls of heaven, how they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; and your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are you not more excellent than they?
040	MAT	006	027	And which one of you being solicitous is able to add one moment to his existence?
040	MAT	006	028	And why are you solicitous concerning raiment? Know the lilies of the field how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin.
040	MAT	006	029	But I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed as one of these.
040	MAT	006	030	But if God so clothed the verdure of the field, existing today and tomorrow cast into the oven, how much more you, O ye of little faith?
040	MAT	006	031	Therefore be not solicitous, saying, What can we eat? or what can we drink? or with what can we be clothed?
040	MAT	006	032	For after all these things the heathen were seeking; for your heavenly Father knoweth that you need all these things.
040	MAT	006	033	But seek first the kingdom, and His righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.
040	MAT	006	034	Therefore be not solicitous unto the morrow: for the morrow will be solicitous for itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.
040	MAT	007	001	Criticise not, that you may not be criticised.
040	MAT	007	002	For with what criticism you criticise, you will be criticised: and with what measure you measure, it will be measured unto you.
040	MAT	007	003	But why do you see the mote which is in the eye of your brother, and do not recognize the beam which is in your own eye?
040	MAT	007	004	Or how will you say to your brother, Permit me, I will cast out the mote from your eye; and behold, there is a beam in your own eye?
040	MAT	007	005	O hypocrite, first cast out the beam from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to cast out the mote from the eye of your brother.
040	MAT	007	006	Give not that which is holy to the dogs, neither cast your pearls before the swine, lest they may trample them under their feet, and having turned round tear you to pieces.
040	MAT	007	007	Ask, and it shall be given unto you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.
040	MAT	007	008	For every one asking receives; and the one seeking finds; and to the one knocking it shall be opened.
040	MAT	007	009	What man is there of you, whom, if his son shall ask bread, he will give him a stone?
040	MAT	007	010	And if he may ask a fish, whether will he give him a serpent?
040	MAT	007	011	Therefore if you, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father who is in the heavens give good things to them that ask Him?
040	MAT	007	012	Therefore all things whatsoever you may wish that the people may do unto you, do ye even so unto them: for this is the law and the prophets.
040	MAT	007	013	Enter ye in through the narrow gate: because wide is the gate and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there are, who are going in through it.
040	MAT	007	014	Because narrow is the gate, and contracted the way, that leadeth into life, and few there are who find it.
040	MAT	007	015	But beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are rapacious wolves.
040	MAT	007	016	You shall know them by their fruits. Do the people gather the grape-bunches from thorns, or figs from thistles?
040	MAT	007	017	So every good tree produces good fruits; and a corrupt tree produces evil fruits.
040	MAT	007	018	A good tree is not able to produce evil fruits, neither is a corrupt tree able to produce beautiful fruits.
040	MAT	007	019	Every tree not producing beautiful fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.
040	MAT	007	020	Therefore you shall know them perfectly by their fruits.
040	MAT	007	021	Not every one saying to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens; but he that doeth the will of my Father who is in the heavens.
040	MAT	007	022	Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, and in thy name cast out demons, and in thy name done many mighty works?
040	MAT	007	023	Then I will confess unto them that I never knew you: depart from me, ye who work iniquity.
040	MAT	007	024	Then every one who hears these words of mine, and does them, I will liken him unto a wise man, who built his house upon the rock.
040	MAT	007	025	And the rain came down, and the rivers came, and the winds blew, and fell against that house; and it did not fall; for it was founded upon the rock.
040	MAT	007	026	And every one hearing these words of mine, and doing them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand.
040	MAT	007	027	And the rain came down, and the rivers came, and the winds blew, and beat against that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.
040	MAT	007	028	And it came to pass when Jesus finished these discourses, the multitudes were astonished at His teaching:
040	MAT	007	029	for He was teaching them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.
040	MAT	008	001	And many multitudes followed Him, coming down from the mountain.
040	MAT	008	002	And behold, a leper, having come, continued to worship Him, saying; Lord, if you may be willing, you are able to cleanse me.
040	MAT	008	003	And Jesus, reaching forth His hand, touched him, saying, I am willing; be thou cleansed. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
040	MAT	008	004	And Jesus says to him, See that you may tell no one; but go, show thyself to the priest, and offer the gift which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.
040	MAT	008	005	And He having come into Capernaum, a centurion came to Him, entreating Him,
040	MAT	008	006	and saying; Lord, my servant lies in the house paralyzed, terribly tormented.
040	MAT	008	007	And Jesus says to him, Having come I will heal him.
040	MAT	008	008	And the centurion responding said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou mayest come in under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant will be healed.
040	MAT	008	009	For I am also a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.
040	MAT	008	010	And Jesus hearing, was astonished, and said to those following, Truly I say unto you, I did not find so great faith in Israel.
040	MAT	008	011	And I say unto you, that many will come from the east and from the west, and sit up with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of the heavens:
040	MAT	008	012	but the sons of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: and there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
040	MAT	008	013	And Jesus said to the centurion, Go; and let it be done unto thee as thou hast believed. And his servant was healed at that hour.
040	MAT	008	014	And Jesus having come into the house of Peter, saw his mother-in-law prostrated and burning with fever.
040	MAT	008	015	And He touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she arose, and began to minister unto them.
040	MAT	008	016	And it being evening, they brought to Him many demonized people: and He cast out the demons by His word, and healed all the sick;
040	MAT	008	017	in order that the word spoken by Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, He took our infirmities, and carried our sicknesses.
040	MAT	008	018	And Jesus seeing the multitudes about Him, gave command to go away to the other side.
040	MAT	008	019	And one scribe having come, said to Him, Teacher, I will follow thee whithersoever thou mayest go.
040	MAT	008	020	And Jesus says to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of heaven nests; but the Son of man has not where He may recline His head.
040	MAT	008	021	And another of His disciples said to Him, Lord, permit me first to go away and bury my father.
040	MAT	008	022	And Jesus says to him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead.
040	MAT	008	023	And His disciples followed Him, having come into the ship.
040	MAT	008	024	And behold, there was a great storm on the sea, so that the ship was covered by the waves: and He was asleep.
040	MAT	008	025	And the disciples having come, awoke Him, saying, Lord, save us; we are perishing.
040	MAT	008	026	And He says to them, Why are you afraid, O ye of little faith? Then having arisen, He rebuked the wind and the sea; and there was a great calm.
040	MAT	008	027	And the men were astonished, saying, What sort of a man is this, because winds and the sea obey him?
040	MAT	008	028	Two demoniacs met Him, having come to the other side into the country of the Gadarenes, coming out from the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that no one was able to pass through that way.
040	MAT	008	029	And behold, they cried out, saying, What is there to us and thee, O Son of God? have you come hither to torment us before the time?
040	MAT	008	030	And a herd of many swine was feeding a great way from them.
040	MAT	008	031	And the demons continued to intreat him, saying, If you cast us out, permit us to depart into the herd of swine.
040	MAT	008	032	And He said to them, Go. And they having gone out, went away into the herd of swine; and the whole herd rushed down the precipice into the sea, and perished in the waters.
040	MAT	008	033	And the herders fled, and having gone away into the city, proclaimed all things, and those appertaining to the demonized.
040	MAT	008	034	And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus; and seeing Him, intreated Him, that He should depart from their coasts.
040	MAT	009	001	And having embarked into the ship, He crossed over, and came into His own city.
040	MAT	009	002	And behold, they were bringing to Him a paralyzed man, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said to the paralytic, Be of good cheer, child, thy sins are forgiven thee.
040	MAT	009	003	And behold, certain ones of the scribes said among themselves; This man blasphemeth.
040	MAT	009	004	And Jesus seeing their thoughts said, Why do you think evil in your hearts?
040	MAT	009	005	For whether is it easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee; or, Arise, and walk about?
040	MAT	009	006	But in order that you may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, (then He says to the paralytic), Having arisen, take thy bed, and depart into thy house.
040	MAT	009	007	And having arisen, he came away to his own house.
040	MAT	009	008	And the multitude seeing, were astonished, and glorified God, who giveth such power to men.
040	MAT	009	009	And Jesus passing along from thence, saw a man sitting at the toll, called Matthew; and He says to him, Follow me. And having arisen up, he followed Him.
040	MAT	009	010	And it came to pass, He was sitting at the table in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners, having come were sitting along with Jesus and His disciples.
040	MAT	009	011	And the Pharisees seeing, said to His disciples, Wherefore does your teacher eat with publicans and sinners?
040	MAT	009	012	And Jesus hearing said to them, They that are whole have no need of a physician, but they that are sick.
040	MAT	009	013	But having gone, learned what this is, I wish mercy and not sacrifice: for I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
040	MAT	009	014	Then the disciples of John come to Him, saying, Wherefore do we and the Pharisee fast, but thy disciples do not fast?
040	MAT	009	015	And Jesus said to them, The sons of the bride-chamber are not able to fast, so long as the bridegroom is with them. But the day will come, when the bride-groom must be taken from them, and then they will fast.
040	MAT	009	016	But no one puts a piece of new cloth on an old garment; for it takes its fullness from the garment, and the rent is made worse.
040	MAT	009	017	Neither do they put new wine in old bottles: lest the bottles are broken, and the wine poured out, and the bottles shall perish: but they put the new wine into the new bottles, and both are preserved.
040	MAT	009	018	And He speaking these things to them, behold a certain ruler having come, continued to worship Him, saying, My daughter just now died: but having come put your hand on her, and she shall live.
040	MAT	009	019	And Jesus having risen, follows him, and His disciples.
040	MAT	009	020	And behold, a woman, having an issue of blood twelve years, and coming to Him behind, touched the hem of His garment.
040	MAT	009	021	For she continued to say within herself, If I may only touch His garment, I will be saved.
040	MAT	009	022	And the woman was saved from that hour. And Jesus turning and seeing her said, Be of good cheer, daughter; thy faith hath saved thee.
040	MAT	009	023	And Jesus having come into the house of the ruler, and seeing the flute-players, and the weeping crowd,
040	MAT	009	024	says to them; Retire: for the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth. And they hooted at Him.
040	MAT	009	025	And when the crowd was put out, coming to her, He took her by the hand, and the damsel arose.
040	MAT	009	026	And this news went out into that whole country.
040	MAT	009	027	And two blind men followed Him, going thence, crying out, and saying,
040	MAT	009	028	Have mercy on us, thou Son of David. And the blind men came to Him, having come into the house: and Jesus says to them, Do you believe that I am able to do this? They say to Him, Yea, Lord.
040	MAT	009	029	Then He touched their eyes, saying, Be it unto you according to your faith.
040	MAT	009	030	And their eyes were opened. And Jesus charged them, saying, See that no one know it.
040	MAT	009	031	But they having gone out, spread abroad His fame in all that country.
040	MAT	009	032	And they going out, behold, they brought to Him a dumb man, demonized.
040	MAT	009	033	And the demon having been cast out, the dumb spoke. And the multitudes were astonished, saying,
040	MAT	009	034	Never did it so appear in Israel. And the Pharisees continued to say, He casts out the demons through the prince of the demons.
040	MAT	009	035	And Jesus was going around all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and ailment.
040	MAT	009	036	And seeing the multitudes, He was moved in compassion in their behalf, because they were fleeced and deserted, as sheep having no shepherd.
040	MAT	009	037	Then He says to His disciples, The harvest truly is great and the laborers are few;
040	MAT	009	038	therefore pray the Lord of the harvest that he may send forth laborers into His harvest.
040	MAT	010	001	And calling His twelve disciples, He gave them power over unclean spirits, so as to cast them out, and heal every disease, and every malady.
040	MAT	010	002	And these are the names of the apostles: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;
040	MAT	010	003	Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alpheus, and Lebbeus called Thaddeus;
040	MAT	010	004	Simon the Zealot; and Judas Iscariot, the one also having betrayed Him.
040	MAT	010	005	And Jesus sent out the twelve, commanding them, Go not in the way of the Gentiles, and enter not into a city of the Samaritans.
040	MAT	010	006	But go ye rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
040	MAT	010	007	And going, preach, saying, That the kingdom of the heavens is at hand.
040	MAT	010	008	Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons: freely you did receive, freely give.
040	MAT	010	009	Take not gold, nor silver, nor copper in your girdles;
040	MAT	010	010	nor valise for your journey, neither two coats, nor sandals, nor staff: for the laborer is worthy of his food.
040	MAT	010	011	And into whatsoever city or village you may enter, investigate who in it is worthy; and there abide until you may go hence.
040	MAT	010	012	And going into a house, salute it.
040	MAT	010	013	And if the house may be worthy, let your peace come on it: but if it may be unworthy, let your peace return unto you.
040	MAT	010	014	And whosoever may not receive you, nor hear your words, going out from that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet.
040	MAT	010	015	Truly I say unto you, It will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.
040	MAT	010	016	Behold, I send you forth like sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.
040	MAT	010	017	Beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the sanhedrins, and will beat you in their synagogues;
040	MAT	010	018	and they will lead you before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony unto them and the Gentiles.
040	MAT	010	019	And when they may deliver you, be not solicitous how or what you may speak: for it will be given unto you in that hour what you may say.
040	MAT	010	020	For you are not those speaking, but the Spirit of your Father is speaking in you.
040	MAT	010	021	And brother will deliver brother unto death, and the father the child: and children will rise up against parents, and put them to death.
040	MAT	010	022	And you will be hated by all on account of my name: but he that persevereth unto the end, the same shall be saved.
040	MAT	010	023	And when they may persecute you in this city, fly to another: for truly I say unto you, You may not complete the cities of Israel, until the Son of man may come.
040	MAT	010	024	The disciple is not above his teacher, nor the servant above his lord.
040	MAT	010	025	It is sufficient for the disciple that he may be as his teacher, and the servant, as his lord: if they call the landlord Beelzebul, how much more the inmates of his house?
040	MAT	010	026	Therefore fear them not; for there is nothing hidden, that shall not be revealed; nothing secret, that shall not be known.
040	MAT	010	027	What I say unto you in the darkness, speak ye in the light: and whatsoever you hear in the ear, proclaim upon the housetops.
040	MAT	010	028	Be not afraid of those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but fear ye, rather him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
040	MAT	010	029	Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? and one of them will not fall to the ground without your Father.
040	MAT	010	030	But the hairs of your head are all numbered.
040	MAT	010	031	Then fear not; you are of more value than many sparrows.
040	MAT	010	032	Therefore every one who shall confess me before the people, I will also confess him before my Father, who is in the heavens.
040	MAT	010	033	But whosoever may deny me before the people, I will also deny him before my Father who is in the heavens.
040	MAT	010	034	Think not that I came to send peace on the earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.
040	MAT	010	035	For I came to divide a man against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law:
040	MAT	010	036	and the enemies of a man will be the inmates of his own house.
040	MAT	010	037	He that loveth father and mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
040	MAT	010	038	Whosoever does not take his cross and follow after me, is not worthy of me.
040	MAT	010	039	The one having found his soul shall lose it; and the one losing his soul for my sake shall find it.
040	MAT	010	040	The one receiving you will receive me, and the one receiving me will receive Him that sent me.
040	MAT	010	041	The one receiving a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive the reward of a prophet; and the one receiving a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive the reward of a righteous man.
040	MAT	010	042	And whosoever may give one of these little ones only a cup of cold water, in the name of a disciple, truly I say unto you, He can not lose his reward.
040	MAT	011	001	And it came to pass, when Jesus finished teaching His twelve disciples, He departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities.
040	MAT	011	002	And John hearing in the prison the works of Christ, sending two of his disciples,
040	MAT	011	003	said to Him, Art thou He who is coming, or must we expect another?
040	MAT	011	004	Jesus responding said to them, Having gone, proclaim unto John the things which you hear and see.
040	MAT	011	005	The blind are looking up, and the lame are walking about, the lepers are being cleansed, and the deaf are hearing, the dead are being raised, and the poor are having the gospel preached unto them:
040	MAT	011	006	and blessed is he, whosoever may not be offended in me.
040	MAT	011	007	And they departing, Jesus began to speak to the multitudes concerning John, What went you out in the wilderness to see? a reed shaken by the wind?
040	MAT	011	008	But what went you out to see? a man clothed in soft raiment? Behold those wearing soft raiment are in the houses of the kings.
040	MAT	011	009	But what went you out to see? a prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet:
040	MAT	011	010	for this is he, concerning whom it has been written, Behold, I send my messenger before my face, who will prepare thy way before thee.
040	MAT	011	011	Truly I say unto you, Among those having been born of women there has not risen a greater than John the Baptist: nevertheless the least in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he.
040	MAT	011	012	From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of the heavens suffers violence, and the violent are taking it by force.
040	MAT	011	013	For all the prophets and the law prophesied till John.
040	MAT	011	014	And if you wish to receive it, he is Elijah, who is to come.
040	MAT	011	015	Let the one having ears to hear, hear.
040	MAT	011	016	But to whom shall I liken this generation? It is like little children sitting in the market-place, and calling to their comrades, and saying,
040	MAT	011	017	We piped unto you, and you did not dance; we mourned unto you, and you did not lament.
040	MAT	011	018	For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has a demon.
040	MAT	011	019	The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold, a gluttonous and wine-drinking man, a friend of publicans and sinners. Wisdom is truly justified by her children.
040	MAT	011	020	Then He began to upbraid the cities in which the most mighty works of His were performed, because they did not repent.
040	MAT	011	021	Woe unto thee, Chorazin! Woe unto thee, Bethsaida! because if the mighty works which were wrought in you had been in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
040	MAT	011	022	Moreover I say unto you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you.
040	MAT	011	023	And thou, Capernaum, art thou not exalted up to heaven? thou shall be cast down to Hades: because if the mighty works which were wrought in thee had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
040	MAT	011	024	Moreover I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.
040	MAT	011	025	At that time Jesus responding said, I praise thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and of earth, because thou hast hidden these things from the wise and the prudent, and reveal them unto babes.
040	MAT	011	026	Yea, Father, because it was so well pleasing in thy sight.
040	MAT	011	027	All things were delivered unto me by my Father: and no one perfectly knows the Son, except the Father; neither does any one perfectly know the Father, except the Son; and he to whom the Son may wish to reveal Him.
040	MAT	011	028	Come unto me, all ye who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
040	MAT	011	029	Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; because I am meek and lowly in heart: and you shall find rest unto your souls.
040	MAT	011	030	For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.
040	MAT	012	001	At that time Jesus went on the Sabbath through the cornfields; and His disciples were hungry, and began to pluck the ears, and eat.
040	MAT	012	002	And the Pharisees, seeing, said to Him, Behold thy disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.
040	MAT	012	003	And He said to them, Have you not read what David did, when he was hungry, and those with him?
040	MAT	012	004	How he came into the house of God, and ate the shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, nor those with him, except the priests only?
040	MAT	012	005	Have you not read in the law, that the priests in the temple do profane the Sabbath, and are blameless?
040	MAT	012	006	But I say unto you, that there is One here greater than the temple.
040	MAT	012	007	But if ye had known what this is, I wish mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the innocent.
040	MAT	012	008	For the Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath.
040	MAT	012	009	And having passed on thence, He came into their synagogue.
040	MAT	012	010	And behold, there was a man having a withered hand. And they asked Him saying, Whether is it lawful to heal on Sabbath? that they might accuse Him.
040	MAT	012	011	And He said to them; What man shall there he of you, who shall have one sheep, and if it shall fall into a pit on the Sabbath, will he not lay hold of it and lift it up?
040	MAT	012	012	Therefore how much more valuable is a man than a sheep? So it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.
040	MAT	012	013	Then He says to the man, Reach forth thy hand. And he reached it forth and it was restored.
040	MAT	012	014	And the Pharisees, having gone out, took counsel against I Him that they might destroy Him.
040	MAT	012	015	And Jesus having known it departed thence: and many multitudes followed him, and he healed them all.
040	MAT	012	016	And He charged them much that they should not make Him known.
040	MAT	012	017	In order that the word spoken by Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, saying,
040	MAT	012	018	Behold, my servant whom I have chosen; my beloved in whom my soul took delight: I will place my Spirit upon Him, and He will proclaim judgment to the Gentiles.
040	MAT	012	019	He will not strive, nor scream, nor shall any one hear His voice in the streets.
040	MAT	012	020	The bruised reed He will not break, and He will not quench the smoking wick, until He may send forth judgment unto victory.
040	MAT	012	021	And in his name shall the Gentiles hope.
040	MAT	012	022	Then a demonized man was brought to Him, blind and dumb: and He healed him, so that the blind and dumb man both spake and saw.
040	MAT	012	023	And all the multitudes were astonished, and continued to say, Is not this the son of David?
040	MAT	012	024	And the Pharisees hearing, said, This man casts not out demons, except through Beelzebul the prince of the demons.
040	MAT	012	025	And Jesus knowing their thoughts said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself comes to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand.
040	MAT	012	026	And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then will his kingdom stand?
040	MAT	012	027	lf I through Beelzebul cast out demons, through whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges.
040	MAT	012	028	But if I through the Spirit of God cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come nigh unto you.
040	MAT	012	029	Or how is any one able to enter into the house of a strong man, and spoil his goods, unless he may first bind the strong man, and then he can spoil his house.
040	MAT	012	030	And the one not being with me is against me; and the one not gathering with me scatters abroad.
040	MAT	012	031	Therefore I say unto you, every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men; but the blasphemy of the Spirit shall not be forgiven unto men.
040	MAT	012	032	And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven unto him: but whosoever may speak against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven unto him, either in this age, or that which is to come.
040	MAT	012	033	Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by the fruit.
040	MAT	012	034	O ye generations of vipers, how are you, being evil, able to speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
040	MAT	012	035	The good man, out of the good treasure (heart) brings forth good things: and the wicked man out of the wicked treasure (heart) brings forth wicked things.
040	MAT	012	036	And I say unto you, that every idle word whatsoever men shall speak, they shall give an account concerning the same in the day of judgment.
040	MAT	012	037	For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shah be condemned.
040	MAT	012	038	Then certain ones of the scribes and Pharisees responded, saying, Teacher, we wish to see a sign from Thee.
040	MAT	012	039	He responding, said to them, A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and no sign shall be given unto it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.
040	MAT	012	040	For as Jonah was in the stomach of the whale three days and three nights, so shall the Son of man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.
040	MAT	012	041	The men of Nineveh will rise in judgment with this generation, and condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.
040	MAT	012	042	The queen of the south will rise in judgment with this generation, and condemn it: because she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold a greater than Solomon is here.
040	MAT	012	043	And when the unclean spirit may go out from the man, he goes through dry places seeking rest, and finds none.
040	MAT	012	044	Then he says, I will return to my own house whence I came out; and having come, he finds it empty, swept, and beautified.
040	MAT	012	045	Then he goes, and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and having come in dwells there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. So it will also be with this wicked generation.
040	MAT	012	046	And He yet speaking to the multitudes, behold, His mother and His brothers stood without, seeking to speak to Him.
040	MAT	012	047	And a certain one said to Him; Behold, thy mother and thy brothers stand without, seeking to speak to thee.
040	MAT	012	048	And He responding said to the one speaking to Him; Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?
040	MAT	012	049	And reaching forth His hand to His disciples, He said, Behold my mother and my brothers!
040	MAT	012	050	For whosoever may do the will of my Father who is in the heavens, the same is my brother, and my sister, and my mother.
040	MAT	013	001	On that day Jesus having come out from the house, was sitting by the sea:
040	MAT	013	002	and many multitudes were gathered unto Him, so that having gone into a ship, He sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.
040	MAT	013	003	And He spoke many things to them in parables, saying, Behold a sower went out to sow.
040	MAT	013	004	And while he was sowing, some seeds fell by the wayside, and the fowls came and ate them up.
040	MAT	013	005	And others fell among stones, where they had not much earth: and sprang up immediately, because they had no depth of earth:
040	MAT	013	006	and the sun having risen, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.
040	MAT	013	007	But others fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up and choked them.
040	MAT	013	008	But others fell in good ground, and gave fruit, some a hundred, some sixty, and some thirty.
040	MAT	013	009	Let him that hath ears to hear, hear.
040	MAT	013	010	And His disciples coming, said to Him; Wherefore do you speak to them in parables?
040	MAT	013	011	He responding said to them, Because it has been given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to them it has not been given.
040	MAT	013	012	But whosoever has, it shall be given to him, and he shall have more abundantly: but whosoever has not, it shall be taken from him even what he has.
040	MAT	013	013	Therefore I speak to them in parables; because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.
040	MAT	013	014	And the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled unto them, saying, By hearing ye shall hear, and may not understand; and seeing you shall see, and may not perceive.
040	MAT	013	015	Because the heart of this people is waxed gross, and they heard heavily with their ears, and closed their eyes; lest they may see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn, and I shall heal them.
040	MAT	013	016	But happy are your eyes, because they see; and your ears, because they hear.
040	MAT	013	017	Truly I say unto you, that many prophets and righteous men desired to see those things which you see, and saw them not; and to hear those things which you hear, and heard them not.
040	MAT	013	018	Therefore hear ye the parable of the sower.
040	MAT	013	019	Every one hearing the word of the kingdom, and not understanding it, the wicked one comes, and seizes away that which is sown in his heart: he is the one sown by the wayside.
040	MAT	013	020	But the one sown upon the rocks, is he who heareth the word, and immediately with joy receives it;
040	MAT	013	021	but it has no root in him, but is temporary; and tribulation or persecution arising on account of the word, immediately he is offended.
040	MAT	013	022	But the one sown among the thorns, is he who heareth the word; and the care of this age, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke out the word, and he becomes unfruitful.
040	MAT	013	023	And the one having been sown on good ground, is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; who truly bears fruit, and produces, some a hundred, some sixty, and some thirty.
040	MAT	013	024	He put forth another parable to them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens is like unto a man sowing good seed in his field.
040	MAT	013	025	And while the men slept, an enemy came, and sowed tares in the midst of the wheat, and departed.
040	MAT	013	026	And when the blades sprang up, and produced fruit, then the tares were also made manifest.
040	MAT	013	027	And the servants of the landlord having come to him said, Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? whence then hath it tares?
040	MAT	013	028	And he said to them, A hostile man did this. And the servants say to him, Then do you wish that we, having gone, may gather them?
040	MAT	013	029	And he says, No; lest gathering the tares together you may at the same time along with them root up the wheat.
040	MAT	013	030	Let both grow together till the harvest: and at the time of the harvest, I will say to the reapers, First gather the tares, and bind them in bundles, in order to burn them: and gather the wheat into my barn.
040	MAT	013	031	And He submitted another parable to them, saying; The kingdom of the heavens is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which, a man having taken, sowed in his field;
040	MAT	013	032	which indeed is the smallest of all seeds; and when it grows up, is the greatest of herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of heaven indeed lodge in its branches.
040	MAT	013	033	And he spake another parable unto them; The kingdom of the heavens is like unto the leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, until the whole was leavened.
040	MAT	013	034	Jesus spoke all of these things to the multitudes in parables; and without a parable He was not speaking to them:
040	MAT	013	035	in order that the word spoken by Isaiah, the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables: I will make known the things which have been hidden from the foundation.
040	MAT	013	036	Then leaving the multitudes, He came into the house: and His disciples came to Him saying; Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field.
040	MAT	013	037	And He responding said, The one sowing the good seed is the Son of man;
040	MAT	013	038	and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the wicked one,
040	MAT	013	039	and the enemy sowing them is the devil: and the harvest is the end of the age; and the reapers are the angels.
040	MAT	013	040	Then as the tares are gathered and burnt up with fire; so it will be in the end of the age.
040	MAT	013	041	The Son of man will send forth His angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and those who do iniquity,
040	MAT	013	042	and will cast them into the furnace of the fire: and there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
040	MAT	013	043	Then the righteous will shine as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. But let the one having ears, hear.
040	MAT	013	044	The kingdom of the heavens is like unto a treasure having been hidden in a field; which a man having found, concealed; and from his joy he goes and sells all things so many as he has, and buys that field.
040	MAT	013	045	Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like unto a man seeking beautiful pearls:
040	MAT	013	046	and having found one pearl of great price, having gone away he sold all things, so many as he had, and bought it.
040	MAT	013	047	Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like unto a net cast into the sea, and gathering of every kind;
040	MAT	013	048	which, when it was filled, drawing up on the shore, and sitting down, they gathered the good into baskets, and threw the bad away.
040	MAT	013	049	So it will be in the end of the age: the angels will go forth, and will separate the wicked from the midst of the righteous,
040	MAT	013	050	and will cast them into the furnace of the fire: and there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
040	MAT	013	051	Do you understand all these things? They say to Him, Yea.
040	MAT	013	052	And He said to them, Therefore every scribe having been discipled into the kingdom of the heavens is like unto a man who is a landlord, who bringeth out of his treasure things both new and old.
040	MAT	013	053	And it came to pass, when Jesus finished these parables, He departed thence.
040	MAT	013	054	And having come into His own country He was teaching them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, Whence this wisdom and these miracles unto Him?
040	MAT	013	055	Is not He the son of the carpenter? is not His mother called Mary? are not His brothers, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?
040	MAT	013	056	And are not His sisters all here with us? Whence then are these things to Him?
040	MAT	013	057	And they were offended in Him. And Jesus said to them; A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and in his own house.
040	MAT	013	058	And He did not many mighty works there on account of their unbelief.
040	MAT	014	001	And at that time Herod the tetrarch heard the fame of Jesus,
040	MAT	014	002	and he said to his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore miracles are wrought in him.
040	MAT	014	003	For Herod having arrested John, bound him, and put him in prison, on account of Herodias the wife of his brother Philip.
040	MAT	014	004	For John said to him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.
040	MAT	014	005	And wishing to kill him, he feared the multitude, because they esteemed him as a prophet.
040	MAT	014	006	Herod's birthday being celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst, and pleased Herod;
040	MAT	014	007	consequently with an oath he promised to give to her whatsoever she might ask.
040	MAT	014	008	And being instigated by her mother, she says, Give me the head of John the Baptist here in a charger.
040	MAT	014	009	And the king was grieved; nevertheless on account of his oaths, and those who were sitting with him, he commanded it to be given.
040	MAT	014	010	And sending, he beheaded John in prison;
040	MAT	014	011	and his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother.
040	MAT	014	012	And His disciples, having come, took the body, and buried it; and having come they proclaimed it to Jesus.
040	MAT	014	013	And Jesus hearing, departed thence in a ship privately into a desert place. And the multitudes hearing, followed Him on foot from the cities.
040	MAT	014	014	And Jesus having come out saw a great multitude; and was moved with compassion in their behalf, and healed their sick.
040	MAT	014	015	And it being evening, His disciples came to Him saying, It is a desert place, and the hour is already advanced; therefore send away the multitudes, that they having gone into the villages, may purchase for themselves victuals.
040	MAT	014	016	And Jesus said to them, They have no need to go away; you give them to eat.
040	MAT	014	017	And they say to Him, We have nothing here except five loaves and two fishes.
040	MAT	014	018	And He said, Bring them hither to me.
040	MAT	014	019	And commanding the multitudes to sit down on the grass; and taking the five loaves and the two fishes, looking up to heaven, He blessed them; and breaking, gave the bread to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.
040	MAT	014	020	And all ate, and were filled: and they took up the remainder of the fragments twelve baskets full.
040	MAT	014	021	And the men eating were about five thousand, besides women and children.
040	MAT	014	022	And Jesus immediately constrained His disciples to embark into the ship and go before Him to the other side, until he can send away the multitudes.
040	MAT	014	023	And having dismissed the multitudes He went up into the mountain alone, to pray. And it being evening He was there alone.
040	MAT	014	024	And the ship was already midsea, laboring by the waves; for the wind was contrary.
040	MAT	014	025	And at the fourth watch of the night, He came to them, walking on the sea.
040	MAT	014	026	And the disciples seeing Him walking on the sea, were afrighted, saying, It is a specter; and they cried out from fear.
040	MAT	014	027	And immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, Be of good cheer; I am here; fear not.
040	MAT	014	028	And Peter responding said, Lord, if thou art there, command me to come to thee on the waters.
040	MAT	014	029	And He said, Come. And Peter having come down from the ship, walked on the waters, and came toward Jesus.
040	MAT	014	030	And seeing the wind strong, became alarmed; and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save me.
040	MAT	014	031	And Jesus immediately reaching out His hand, received him, and says to him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?
040	MAT	014	032	And they having come into the ship, the wind ceased.
040	MAT	014	033	And those in the ship having come worshiped Him, saying, Truly thou art the Son of God.
040	MAT	014	034	And crossing over, they came into the land of Gennesaret.
040	MAT	014	035	And the men of that place recognizing Him, sent into all the surrounding country and brought to Him all the sick;
040	MAT	014	036	and they continued to intreat Him that they should only touch the hem of His garment: and so many as touched were thoroughly saved.
040	MAT	015	001	Then the scribes and Pharisees, who are from Jerusalem, come to Jesus, saying,
040	MAT	015	002	Wherefore do thy disciples transgress the traditions of the elders? for they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.
040	MAT	015	003	And responding He said to them; Wherefore do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition?
040	MAT	015	004	For God commanded saying, Honor thy father and mother: and, He that speaketh evil of father or mother, let him die with death.
040	MAT	015	005	But you say, Whosoever may say to father or mother, It is a gift, whatsoever you may be profited by me; and he shall no longer honor his father or his mother.
040	MAT	015	006	You made void the commandment of God by your tradition.
040	MAT	015	007	Ye hypocrites, beautifully did Isaiah prophesy concerning you, saying,
040	MAT	015	008	This people honor me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.
040	MAT	015	009	But in vain they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.
040	MAT	015	010	And calling the multitude to Him, He said to them, Hear and understand:
040	MAT	015	011	That if which cometh into the mouth does not defile the man; but that which cometh out from the mouth, that defiles the man.
040	MAT	015	012	Then His disciples having come to Him say, Do you not know that the Pharisees hearing your word, were offended?
040	MAT	015	013	And He responding said, Every plant which my heavenly Father did not plant, shall be rooted up.
040	MAT	015	014	Let them alone: the blind are leaders of the blind: if the blind may lead the blind, both will fall into the ditch.
040	MAT	015	015	Peter responding said to Him, Explain unto us the parable.
040	MAT	015	016	And Jesus said, Are you indeed still without understanding?
040	MAT	015	017	Do you know that everything entering into the mouth goes into the stomach, and is cast out into excrement?
040	MAT	015	018	But those things going out from the mouth come forth from the heart; and these pollute the man.
040	MAT	015	019	For out of the heart proceed evil reasonings, murders, fornications, adulteries, thefts, false testimonies, blasphemies.
040	MAT	015	020	These are the things which defile the man: but to eat bread with unwashed hands does not defile the man.
040	MAT	015	021	And Jesus having come out thence, departed into the regions of Tyre and Sidon.
040	MAT	015	022	And behold, a Canaanitish woman having come out from those coasts, cried unto Him saying, Have mercy on me, Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is terribly demonized.
040	MAT	015	023	And He responded to her not a word; and His disciples, having come to Him, asked Him, saying, Send her away; because she cries after us.
040	MAT	015	024	And He responding said, I am not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
040	MAT	015	025	And having come she continued to worship Him, saying, Lord, assist me.
040	MAT	015	026	He responding said, It is not good to take the children's bread and cast it to the little dogs.
040	MAT	015	027	And she said, Yea, Lord: for the little dogs eat of the crumbs falling from their master's table.
040	MAT	015	028	Then Jesus responding said to her, O woman, great is thy faith; let it be done unto thee as thou dost wish. And her daughter was healed from that hour.
040	MAT	015	029	And Jesus having departed thence, came to the Sea of Galilee; and having gone up into the mountain, He was sitting there.
040	MAT	015	030	And many multitudes came to Him, having with them the lame, the blind, the deaf, the maimed, and many others, and laid them down at the feet of Jesus; and He healed them:
040	MAT	015	031	so that the multitudes were astonished, seeing the dumb speaking, the maimed whole, the lame walking about, and the blind seeing: and they glorified the God of Israel.
040	MAT	015	032	And Jesus calling His disciples to Him, said, I sympathize with the multitude, because already three days abide unto me, and they have nothing which they may eat; I do not wish to send them away fasting, lest they may faint on the road.
040	MAT	015	033	And His disciples say to Him, Whence is there to us so much bread in the wilderness, as to feed so great a multitude?
040	MAT	015	034	And Jesus says to them; How much bread have ye? And they said, Seven loaves and a few fishes.
040	MAT	015	035	He having commanded the multitudes to sit down upon the ground,
040	MAT	015	036	He took the seven loaves and the fishes; having given thanks, He broke them, and gave to His disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
040	MAT	015	037	And they all ate, and were filled: and they took up the residue of fragments, seven baskets full.
040	MAT	015	038	And those eating were about tour thousand men, besides women and children.
040	MAT	015	039	And having sent away the multitudes, He went into a ship and came into the coasts of Magdala.
040	MAT	016	001	And the Pharisees and Sadducees having come to Him, tempting Him, asked Him to show them a sign from heaven.
040	MAT	016	002	And He responding said to them, It being evening, you say, It will be fair weather: because the sky is red:
040	MAT	016	003	and in the morning, It will be stormy to-day: for the lowering sky is red: ye hypocrites, you know how to discern the face of the sky: but are you not able to discern the signs of the times?
040	MAT	016	004	A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign. And no sign shall be given it, except the sign of the prophet Jonah. And leaving them, He departed.
040	MAT	016	005	His disciples having come to the other side forgot to take bread.
040	MAT	016	006	And Jesus said to them; See and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
040	MAT	016	007	And they were reasoning among themselves, saying, That it is because we did not take bread.
040	MAT	016	008	And Jesus knowing said to them, Why do you reason among yourselves, O ye of little faith, because you did not take bread?
040	MAT	016	009	Do you not yet understand? do you not remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
040	MAT	016	010	Nor the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets you took up?
040	MAT	016	011	How do you not understand that I did not speak to you concerning bread, to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.
040	MAT	016	012	Then they understood that He did not say to beware of the leaven of the (bread) of the Pharisees and Sadducees, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
040	MAT	016	013	And Jesus having come into the regions of Caesarea Philippi, asked His disciples, saying, Whom do the people say that I, the Son of man, am?
040	MAT	016	014	And they said, Some, John the Baptist; and some, Elijah; and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.
040	MAT	016	015	And He says to them, But whom do you say that I am?
040	MAT	016	016	And Simon Peter responding said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.
040	MAT	016	017	And Jesus responding said to him, Blessed art thou, Simon the son of Jonah: because flesh and blood did not reveal it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens.
040	MAT	016	018	And I say to thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock will I build my Church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.
040	MAT	016	019	And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens: and whatsoever you may bind on the earth, shall be bound in the heavens; and whatsoever you may loose on earth shall be loosed in the heavens.
040	MAT	016	020	Then He commanded His disciples that they should tell no one that He is the Christ.
040	MAT	016	021	And from this time Jesus began to show to His disciples, that it behooves Him to go away to Jerusalem, and to suffer many things from the elders and the chief priest and the scribes, and to be killed, and rise the third day.
040	MAT	016	022	And Peter taking Him to him, began to rebuke Him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord; because this shall not be unto thee.
040	MAT	016	023	And turning He said to Peter, Get behind me, adversary: thou art my stumbling-block; because thou art not thinking about the things of God, but those of men.
040	MAT	016	024	Then Jesus said to His disciples, If any one wishes to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
040	MAT	016	025	For whosoever may wish to save his soul shall lose it: and whosoever may lose his soul for my sake shall find it.
040	MAT	016	026	For what is a man profited, if he may gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?
040	MAT	016	027	For the Son of man is about to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will give to each one according to his works.
040	MAT	016	028	Truly I say unto you, There are some of those standing here, who may not taste of death, until they may see the Son of man coming in His kingdom.
040	MAT	017	001	And after six days Jesus takes Peter, and James, and John his brother, and carries them up into an exceedingly high mountain privately.
040	MAT	017	002	And was transfigured before them, and His face shone like the sun, and His garments became white as the light.
040	MAT	017	003	And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared unto them, talking with Him.
040	MAT	017	004	And Peter responding, said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: it you will, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.
040	MAT	017	005	He still speaking, behold, a white cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am delighted; hear ye Him.
040	MAT	017	006	And the disciples, hearing, fell on their face, and feared exceedingly.
040	MAT	017	007	And Jesus came to them and touching them said, Arise, and fear not.
040	MAT	017	008	And lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, except Jesus only.
040	MAT	017	009	And they coming down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no one, until the Son of man may rise from the dead.
040	MAT	017	010	And His disciples asked Him, saying, Why then do the scribes say that it behooves Elijah to come first?
040	MAT	017	011	And Jesus responding said to them, Elijah indeed comes, and will restore all things:
040	MAT	017	012	but I say unto you, that Elijah has already come, and they recognized Him not, but did unto Him so many things as they wished; thus the Son of man is also about to suffer by them.
040	MAT	017	013	Then the disciples understood that He spoke to them concerning John the Baptist.
040	MAT	017	014	And they having come to the multitude, the man came to Him, worshiping Him on his knees,
040	MAT	017	015	and saying, Lord, have mercy on my son, because he is a lunatic and suffers terribly: for frequently he falls into the fire, and frequently into the water.
040	MAT	017	016	And I brought him to thy disciples, and they were not able to heal him.
040	MAT	017	017	And Jesus responding said: O, faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? bring him hither to me.
040	MAT	017	018	And Jesus rebuked him, and the demon came out from him, and the child was healed from that hour.
040	MAT	017	019	Then the disciples coming to Jesus privately, said, Wherefore were we not able to cast him out?
040	MAT	017	020	and Jesus says to them, On account of your unbelief. For truly I say unto you, If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible to you.
040	MAT	017	022	And they sojourning in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men.
040	MAT	017	023	And they will kill Him; and He will rise the third day. And they were grieved exceedingly.
040	MAT	017	024	And they having come into Capernaum, those receiving the double drachma came to Peter, and said, Does your teacher pay the double drachma?
040	MAT	017	025	He says, Yes. And when he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What seems to you, Simon? from whom do the kings of the earth receive toll or tribute? from their own sons or aliens?
040	MAT	017	026	And he saying from aliens, Jesus said to him, Then the sons are free.
040	MAT	017	027	But in order that we may not offend them, going to the sea, cast in a hook, and take the first fish coming up; and opening its mouth, you will find a stater: having received it, give it to them for me and thee.
040	MAT	018	001	At that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Then which one is the greater in the kingdom of the heavens?
040	MAT	018	002	And Jesus calling a little child to Him, placed it in the midst of them,
040	MAT	018	003	and said, Truly I say unto you, unless you may be converted, and become as little children, you can not enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
040	MAT	018	004	Therefore whosoever shall humble himself as this little child, the same is the greater in the kingdom of the heavens;
040	MAT	018	005	and whosoever shall receive such little child in my name, receives me.
040	MAT	018	006	But whosoever may offend one of these little ones, who believe in me, it is good for him that a millstone may be hanged to his neck, and he may be drowned in the depth of the sea.
040	MAT	018	007	Woe unto the world on account of offensives, for it is necessary that offensives come; but woe unto that man through whom the offense comes!
040	MAT	018	008	If thy hand or thy foot offends thee, cut them off and cast them from thee: it is good for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into eternal fire.
040	MAT	018	009	And if thine eye offend thee, cast it from thee: it is good for thee having one eye entering into life, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of the fire.
040	MAT	018	010	See that you do not despise one of these little ones; for I say unto you, that their angels in heaven do always behold the face of my Father who is in the heavens.
040	MAT	018	012	What seems to you? if there may be a hundred sheep to one man, and one of them may go astray, does he not, leaving the ninety and nine, going to the mountains, seek that which has gone astray?
040	MAT	018	013	And if it maybe that he finds it, truly I say unto you, that he rejoiceth more over it than over the ninety and nine that went not astray.
040	MAT	018	014	So it is not the will of your Father who is in the heavens, that one of these little ones may perish.
040	MAT	018	015	But if thy brother may sin, go, and convict him between thee and him alone: if he may hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother:
040	MAT	018	016	if he may not hear thee, take with thyself one or two, in order that in the mouth of two or three witnesses the word may stand.
040	MAT	018	017	But if he may not hear them, tell the church: and if indeed he may not hear the church, let him be to thee as a heathen and publican.
040	MAT	018	018	Truly I say unto you, that whatsoever things you may bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever things you may loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
040	MAT	018	019	Again I say unto you, that if two of you may agree upon the earth concerning everything which you may ask, it shall be done unto you by my Father, who is in the heavens.
040	MAT	018	020	For where two or three are assembled in my name, there I am in the midst of them.
040	MAT	018	021	Then Peter, coming to Him, said, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? until seven times?
040	MAT	018	022	Jesus says to him, I say not unto thee, Until seven time; but Until seventy times seven.
040	MAT	018	023	Therefore the kingdom of the heavens is like unto a kingly man, who wished to make a reckoning with his servants.
040	MAT	018	024	And he beginning to reckon, one was brought to him owing him myriads of talents.
040	MAT	018	025	And he not having wherewith to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all things so many as he had, and payment to be made.
040	MAT	018	026	Then that servant falling down, continued to worship him, saying, Be patient with me, and I will pay you all.
040	MAT	018	027	The lord of that servant, being moved with compassion, sent him away, and forgave him the debt.
040	MAT	018	028	And that servant having gone out, found one of his fellow-servants, who owed him one hundred denaria: seized him, throttled him, saying, Pay me what you owe me.
040	MAT	018	029	Then his fellow-servant falling down, continued to intreat him, saying, Be patient with me and I will pay thee.
040	MAT	018	030	And he was not willing: but having gone away he cast him into prison, until he could pay that which was owing.
040	MAT	018	031	Then his fellow-servants seeing those things which had taken place, were grieved exceedingly, and coming related to their lord all the things which transpired.
040	MAT	018	032	Then his lord calling him says to him, Thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, since thou didst intreat me:
040	MAT	018	033	did it not behoove thee also to have mercy on thy fellow-servant, as I had mercy on thee?
040	MAT	018	034	And his lord being angry delivered him to the tormenters, until he should pay all that was due him.
040	MAT	018	035	Thus my Heavenly Father will also do unto you, if you do not forgive each one his brother from your hearts.
040	MAT	019	001	And it came to pass when Jesus finished these sermons, He departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judea, beyond the Jordan.
040	MAT	019	002	And many multitudes followed Him; and He healed them there.
040	MAT	019	003	And the Pharisees came to Him, tempting Him, and saying to Him; Is it lawful for a man to send away his wife for any cause?
040	MAT	019	004	And He responding said to them, Have you not read, that the one having made them from the beginning made them male and female?
040	MAT	019	005	And He said, On account of this a man shall leave father and mother, and cleave unto his wife; and they two shall be one flesh.
040	MAT	019	006	So they are no longer two, but one flesh: therefore what God joined together, let no man separate.
040	MAT	019	007	They say to Him, Then why did Moses command to give a book of divorcement, and to send her away?
040	MAT	019	008	He says to them, Moses on account of the hardness of your heart permitted you to send away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.
040	MAT	019	009	But I say unto you, That whosoever may send away his wife, not for fornication, and may marry another, commits adultery.
040	MAT	019	010	His disciples say to Him, If the cause of a man with his wife is thus, it is better not to marry.
040	MAT	019	011	And He said to them, All do not receive this word, but those to whom it has been given.
040	MAT	019	012	For there are eunuchs, who have been so born from the womb of their mother. And there are eunuchs, who have been eunuchized by men: and there are eunuchs, who eunuchized themselves for the sake of the kingdom of the heavens. He who is able to receive it, let him receive it.
040	MAT	019	013	Then little children were brought to Him, that He might put His hands on them, and pray. And the disciples rebuked them.
040	MAT	019	014	But Jesus said, Suffer the little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of the heavens.
040	MAT	019	015	And putting His hands on them, he departed thence.
040	MAT	019	016	Behold, one coming to Him said, Good Teacher, what good thing shall I do, in order that I may have eternal life?
040	MAT	019	017	And He said to him, Why do you ask me concerning the good One? One is good. If you wish to enter into life, keep the commandments.
040	MAT	019	018	He says to Him, What? And Jesus said to him, Thou shalt not murder, thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt hot steal, thou shalt not bear false witness,
040	MAT	019	019	honor the father and the mother, and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
040	MAT	019	020	The young man says to Him, All these have I kept from my youth: what lack I yet?
040	MAT	019	021	Jesus said to him, If you wish to be perfect, go, sell your possessions, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.
040	MAT	019	022	And the young man hearing the word, went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.
040	MAT	019	023	And Jesus said to His disciples, Truly I say unto you, that a rich man will hardly enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
040	MAT	019	024	And again I say to you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to go into the kingdom of God.
040	MAT	019	025	And the disciples hearing, were astonished exceedingly, saying, Who then is able to be saved?
040	MAT	019	026	And Jesus looking on them said; With men this is impossible; but all things are possible with God.
040	MAT	019	027	Then Peter responding said to Him, Behold, we have left all things, and followed Thee; what then shall be to us?
040	MAT	019	028	And Jesus said to them, Truly I say unto you, that you who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man may sit upon the throne of His glory, you shall also sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
040	MAT	019	029	And every one who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, on account of my name, shall receive a hundred-fold, and inherit eternal life.
040	MAT	019	030	But many who are first shall be last, and the last first.
040	MAT	020	001	For the kingdom of the heavens is like unto a landlord man, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
040	MAT	020	002	And having agreed with the laborers for a denarion per day, sent them into his vineyard.
040	MAT	020	003	And having gone out about the third hour, he saw others standing idle in the forum:
040	MAT	020	004	and he said to them, Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they departed.
040	MAT	020	005	Again having gone out about the sixth and ninth hours, he did likewise.
040	MAT	020	006	And about the eleventh hour having gone out, he found others standing; and says to them, Why stand ye here idle all the day?
040	MAT	020	007	They say to him, Because no one hired us. He says to them, Go ye also into the vineyard.
040	MAT	020	008	And it being evening, the lord of the vineyard says to his steward, Call the laborers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last even unto the first.
040	MAT	020	009	And those having come about the eleventh hour, received each man a denarion.
040	MAT	020	010	But the first having come supposed that they shall receive more; and themselves also received each one a denarion.
040	MAT	020	011	But receiving it, they murmured against the landlord,
040	MAT	020	012	saying, These labored one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, who bore the burden of the day and the heat.
040	MAT	020	013	But he responding said to one of them, Comrade, I do thee no wrong; didst thou not agree with me for a denarion?
040	MAT	020	014	Take thine own, and go. I wish to give unto this last one, even as unto thee.
040	MAT	020	015	Is it not lawful for me to do as I wish with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?
040	MAT	020	016	So the last shall be first, and first last.
040	MAT	020	017	And Jesus going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples privately, on the way and said to them,
040	MAT	020	018	Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed to the chief priests and scribes; and they will condemn Him to death,
040	MAT	020	019	and they will deliver Him to the Gentiles to mock, and scourge, and crucify Him: and on the third day He will rise.
040	MAT	020	020	Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Him with her sons, worshiping and asking something from Him.
040	MAT	020	021	And He said to her, What do you wish? She says to Him, Tell me that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right, and one on thy left, in thy kingdom.
040	MAT	020	022	And Jesus responding said, You know not what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup which I am about to drink? They say to Him, We are able.
040	MAT	020	023	And He says to them, You shall indeed drink my cup, but to sit on my right, and on my left, this is not mine to give, but it belongs to those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.
040	MAT	020	024	And the ten hearing were indignant concerning the two brothers.
040	MAT	020	025	But Jesus calling them to Him, said, You know that the rulers of the Gentiles domineer over them, and the great ones exercise authority over them.
040	MAT	020	026	It shall not be so among you; but whosoever may wish to be great among you, shall be your servant;
040	MAT	020	027	and whosoever may wish to be first among you, shall be your slave:
040	MAT	020	028	as the Son of man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give His soul a ransom for many.
040	MAT	020	029	And they going out from Jericho, a great multitude followed Him.
040	MAT	020	030	And behold, two blind men sitting by the wayside, hearing that Jesus is passing by, cried out, saying; Have mercy on us, O son of David.
040	MAT	020	031	And the multitude rebuked them, that they should keep silent. And they cried out the more, saying; Have mercy on us, O Lord, son of David.
040	MAT	020	032	Jesus standing, called them, and said, What do you wish that I shall do unto you?
040	MAT	020	033	They say unto Him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
040	MAT	020	034	And Jesus being moved with compassion, touched their eyes: and immediately they looked up; and followed Him.
040	MAT	021	001	When they drew near to Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage, to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent away two disciples,
040	MAT	021	002	saying to them, Go into the village over against you, and you will immediately find a donkey tied, and the colt with her: loosing, lead her to me.
040	MAT	021	003	And if any one may say any thing to you, tell him, that the Lord hath need of them; and immediately he will send them away.
040	MAT	021	004	And all this took place, that the word spoken by the prophet might be fulfilled, saying,
040	MAT	021	005	Say to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy King cometh, meek, and seated upon a donkey, even a colt, the progeny of the work-beast.
040	MAT	021	006	And the disciples, having gone and done as Jesus commanded them,
040	MAT	021	007	led the donkey, and the colt, and put their garments on them; and He sat on them.
040	MAT	021	008	A great multitude strewed their garments in the road: and others cut down the branches from the trees, and were strewing them in the road.
040	MAT	021	009	And the multitudes going forward, and following, continued to cry out, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest!
040	MAT	021	010	And He having come into Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred, saying; Who is He?
040	MAT	021	011	And the multitudes continued to say, He is the prophet Jesus, the one from Nazareth of Galilee.
040	MAT	021	012	And Jesus came into the temple of God, and cast out all the buying and selling in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money-exchangers, and the seats of those selling the doves;
040	MAT	021	013	and He says to them, It has been written, My house shall be called a house of prayer: but you make it a den of thieves.
040	MAT	021	014	And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple: and He healed them.
040	MAT	021	015	And the chief priests and scribes seeing the wonderful things which He did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying; Hosanna to the son of David, were indignant,
040	MAT	021	016	and said to Him, Do you hear what they are saying? And Jesus says to them, Yes: have you not read, That out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?
040	MAT	021	017	And having left them, He went out of the city into Bethany, and there spent the night.
040	MAT	021	018	And in the morning going into the city, He was hungry.
040	MAT	021	019	And seeing one fig-tree near the road, He went to it, and found nothing on it, except leaves only. And He says to it, Let no fruit ever be from thee; and immediately the fig-tree withered away.
040	MAT	021	020	And the disciples seeing, were astonished, saying, How did the fig-tree immediately wither away?
040	MAT	021	021	And Jesus responding said to them, Truly I say unto you, if you may have faith, and doubt not, not only shall you do that of the fig-tree, but you shall say to this mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea, and it will be done.
040	MAT	021	022	All things whatsoever you may ask in prayer, believing, you shall receive.
040	MAT	021	023	And the chief priests and elders of the people came to Him, while teaching, He having come into the temple, saying, By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave you this authority?
040	MAT	021	024	And Jesus responding, said to them, I ask you also one word, which if you may speak to me, I also will tell you by what authority I am doing these things:
040	MAT	021	025	Whence was the baptism of John? from heaven or from men? And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we may say, From heaven; He will say to us, Why then did you not believe on him?
040	MAT	021	026	But if we may say, From men: we fear the multitude, for all hold John as a prophet.
040	MAT	021	027	And responding they said to Jesus, We do not know. He also said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.
040	MAT	021	028	What seems to you? A man had two sons; and going to the first, he said, Child, go to-day, work in my vineyard.
040	MAT	021	029	And he responding said, I am not willing: but afterward, having regretted, he went.
040	MAT	021	030	And coming to the second, he spoke likewise. And he responding said, I, lord: and went not.
040	MAT	021	031	Which one of the two did the will of the father? They say to Him, The first. Jesus says to them, Truly I say unto you, that the publicans and harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.
040	MAT	021	032	For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you believed him not: but the publicans and harlots believed him, and you, seeing, did not afterward regret it, in order that you might believe him.
040	MAT	021	033	Hear ye another parable. A man was a landlord, who planted a vineyard, and placed a hedge around it, and dug a wine-trough in it, and built a tower, and gave it out to husbandmen, and went away.
040	MAT	021	034	And when the time of the fruits drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, to receive his fruits;
040	MAT	021	035	and the husbandmen taking his servants, beat one, and slew one, and stoned another.
040	MAT	021	036	Again he sent other servants, more than the first: and they did unto them likewise.
040	MAT	021	037	And afterward he sent to them his own son, saying, They will reverence my son.
040	MAT	021	038	But the husbandmen, seeing the son, said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and take possession of his inheritance.
040	MAT	021	039	And taking him, they cast him out of the vine-yard, and slew him.
040	MAT	021	040	Then when the lord of the vine-yard may come, what will he do to those husbandmen?
040	MAT	021	041	They say to Him, He will certainly destroy those wicked men, and give the vineyard to other husband-men, who will render to him the fruits in their seasons.
040	MAT	021	042	Jesus says, Have you not read in the Scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same has come to be the head of the corner: this was with the Lord, and is marvelous in our eyes?
040	MAT	021	043	Therefore I say unto you, that the kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits of it.
040	MAT	021	045	And the chief priests and Pharisees hearing His parables, knew that He speaks concerning them.
040	MAT	021	046	And seeking to arrest Him, they feared the multitudes, since they held Him as a prophet.
040	MAT	022	001	And Jesus responding, again spoke to them in parables, saying,
040	MAT	022	002	The kingdom of the heavens is like a king-man, who made a marriage for his son.
040	MAT	022	003	And he sent his servants to invite those who had been called to the marriage: and they were not willing to come.
040	MAT	022	004	And again he sent other servants, saying; Speak to those who have been called, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatling are slain, and all things are ready: come to the marriage.
040	MAT	022	005	And they being careless, went away, one to his farm, and another to his merchandise:
040	MAT	022	006	but the rest, taking his servants, insulted, and slew them.
040	MAT	022	007	And the king was angry; and sending his armies, he destroyed those murderers, and burnt up their cities.
040	MAT	022	008	Then he says to his servants, The wedding is ready, but those having been invited were not worthy.
040	MAT	022	009	Go ye therefore to crossings of the roads, and so many as you may find, invite to the marriage.
040	MAT	022	010	And those servants having gone out into the ways, led in all whom they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was filled with guests.
040	MAT	022	011	And the king having come in to look upon the guests, saw there a man not having on a wedding-garment.
040	MAT	022	012	And he says to him, Comrade, how did you come in hither, not having the wedding-garment? And he was silent.
040	MAT	022	013	Then the king said to the servants, Having bound him feet and hands, cast him into the darkness which is without; and there shall be weeping and gnashing of the teeth.
040	MAT	022	014	For many are called, but few elected.
040	MAT	022	015	Then the Pharisees going forth, took counsel how they might ensnare Him in His speech.
040	MAT	022	016	And they send to Him their own disciples along with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that thou art true, and that thou art teaching the way of God in truth, and there is not a care to thee for any one; for thou dost not look into the face of men.
040	MAT	022	017	Then tell us, what seems good to thee? is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?
040	MAT	022	018	And Jesus knowing their wickedness, said, Why tempt ye me, O ye hypocrites?
040	MAT	022	019	Show me the tribute money: and they brought Him a denarion.
040	MAT	022	020	And He says to them, Whose is this image and superscription?
040	MAT	022	021	They say to Him, Caesar's. Then He says to them, Therefore render Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things which are God's.
040	MAT	022	022	And hearing they are astonished, and leaving Him, they went away.
040	MAT	022	023	On that day the Sadducees came to Him, saying, there is no resurrection: and asked Him,
040	MAT	022	024	saying, Teacher, Moses said, If any man may die, not having children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.
040	MAT	022	025	But there were among us seven brothers: the first marrying died, and having no seed left his wife to his brother.
040	MAT	022	026	Likewise also, the second, and third, even unto seven.
040	MAT	022	027	And last of all the woman also died.
040	MAT	022	028	Therefore in the resurrection, of which one of the seven shall she be the wife? for they all had her.
040	MAT	022	029	and Jesus responding said to them, You err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.
040	MAT	022	030	For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but they are as angels of God in heaven:
040	MAT	022	031	concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,
040	MAT	022	032	I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
040	MAT	022	033	And the multitudes hearing, were delighted with His teaching.
040	MAT	022	034	And the Pharisees, hearing that He silenced the Sadducees, gathered themselves together.
040	MAT	022	035	And one of them, a theologian, tempting Him, asked Him also, saying,
040	MAT	022	036	Teacher, what is the great commandment in the law?
040	MAT	022	037	And He said to him; Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
040	MAT	022	038	This is the first and great commandment.
040	MAT	022	039	And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
040	MAT	022	040	On these two commandments hang all the law, and the prophets.
040	MAT	022	041	And the Pharisees being assembled, Jesus asked them,
040	MAT	022	042	saying, What seems to you concerning the Christ? whose son is He? They say to Him, Of David.
040	MAT	022	043	He says to them, How then does David in the Spirit call Him Lord, saying,
040	MAT	022	044	The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, until I may make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet?
040	MAT	022	045	Then if David calls Him Lord, how is He his son?
040	MAT	022	046	And no one was able to respond a word to Him, neither did any one from that day dare to ask Him anything more.
040	MAT	023	001	Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and His disciples,
040	MAT	023	002	saying, The scribes and Pharisees sat upon the seat of Moses;
040	MAT	023	003	therefore do and keep all things so many as they may speak to you, but do not according to their works; for they say, and do not.
040	MAT	023	004	But they bind heavy burdens, and place them on the shoulders of the people; and they themselves are not willing to touch them with their finger.
040	MAT	023	005	And they do all their works to be seen by the people: for they broaden their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,
040	MAT	023	006	and they love the first couch at the suppers, and the first seats in the synagogues,
040	MAT	023	007	and salutations in the forums, and to be called by the people, ""Doctor.""
040	MAT	023	008	But be ye not called Doctor: for One is your teacher; and you are all brothers.
040	MAT	023	009	And call no man father upon the earth: for One is your Heavenly Father.
040	MAT	023	010	Be not called teachers: because One is your teacher, Christ.
040	MAT	023	011	And the great of you shall be your deacon.
040	MAT	023	012	But whosoever shall exalt himself, shall be abased; and whosoever shall humble himself shall be exalted.
040	MAT	023	013	But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you shut up the kingdom of the heavens against the people: for you do not go in, neither do you permit those coming in to enter.
040	MAT	023	015	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you compass the sea and the dry land to make one proselyte, and when it may be done, you make him twofold more the son of hell than yourselves.
040	MAT	023	016	Woe unto you, blind guides, who are saying, Whosoever may swear by the temple it is nothing; but whosoever may swear by the gold of the temple, he is debtor.
040	MAT	023	017	Ye fools and blind: for which is the greater, the gold, or the temple sanctifying the gold?
040	MAT	023	018	And, Whosoever may swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever may swear by the gift upon it, is debtor.
040	MAT	023	019	Ye blind: for which is the greater, the gift, or the altar which sanctifies the gift?
040	MAT	023	020	Therefore the one swearing by the altar, swears by it, and by all things which are on it.
040	MAT	023	021	And the one swearing by the temple, swears by it, and by Him who inhabited it.
040	MAT	023	022	And the one swearing by heaven, swears by the throne of God, and by Him that sitteth upon it.
040	MAT	023	023	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you tithe mint and anise and cummin, and pass by the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: it behooves to do these and not to neglect those.
040	MAT	023	024	Ye blind guides, who strain out the gnat, and swallow down the camel.
040	MAT	023	025	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you purify the exterior of the cup and the plate, and within they are full of extortion and impurity.
040	MAT	023	026	Ye blind Pharisee, first purify the inside of the cup, in order that its outside may be clean.
040	MAT	023	027	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you are like whitened sepulchers, which are beautiful indeed externally, but within they are full of the hones of the dead people, and every impurity.
040	MAT	023	028	So you also appear unto the people indeed righteous, but within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
040	MAT	023	029	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you build the tombs of the prophets, and ornament the sepulchers of the righteous,
040	MAT	023	030	and you say, If we were in the days of our fathers we would not have been their fellow-partakers in the blood of the prophets.
040	MAT	023	031	So you witness to yourselves, that you are the sons of those who murdered the prophets.
040	MAT	023	032	And you fill up the measure of your fathers.
040	MAT	023	033	Ye serpents, generations of vipers, how can you escape from the judgment of hell?
040	MAT	023	034	Therefore I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: you will kill and crucify some of them; and will scourge some of them in your synagogues, and will persecute them from city to city;
040	MAT	023	035	in order that all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel, unto the blood of Zachariah the son of the blessed, whom they slew between the temple and the altar, may come upon you.
040	MAT	023	036	Truly I say unto you, all these things shall come upon this generation.
040	MAT	023	037	O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them that have been sent unto thee! how frequently did I wish to gather together thy children, in the manner in which a hen gathers her brood under her wings, but ye were not willing!
040	MAT	023	038	Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.
040	MAT	023	039	For I say unto you, that ye can see me no more until you can say; Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord.
040	MAT	024	001	Jesus having gone out departed from the temple, and His disciples came to Him to show Him the buildings of the temple.
040	MAT	024	002	And responding, He said to them, Do you not see all these? Truly, I say unto you, that stone may not be left here upon stone, which shall not be thrown down.
040	MAT	024	003	And He sitting upon the Mount of Olives; the disciples came to Him privately, saying, Tell us, when these things shall be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming and the end of the age?
040	MAT	024	004	And Jesus responding said to them, See, lest any one may deceive you.
040	MAT	024	005	For many will come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and they will deceive many.
040	MAT	024	006	And you will be about to hear of wars and rumors of wars: see that you are not disturbed: for it behooveth all these things to be, but the end is not yet.
040	MAT	024	007	For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines and earthquakes in divers places.
040	MAT	024	008	And all these things are the beginning of travails.
040	MAT	024	009	Then they will deliver you into tribulation, and will kill you, and you will be hated by all nations on account of my name,
040	MAT	024	010	and then many will be offended; and they will betray one another, and hate one another.
040	MAT	024	011	And many false prophets will arise and deceive many.
040	MAT	024	012	And because iniquity doth abound, the divine love of many will grow cold.
040	MAT	024	013	But the one persevering to the end, the same shall be saved.
040	MAT	024	014	And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world, for a testimony to all the nations; and then the end shall come.
040	MAT	024	015	Then when you may see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let him that readeth know),
040	MAT	024	016	then let those who are in Judea fly to the mountains:
040	MAT	024	017	and let him who is on the housetop not come down to take things out of his house:
040	MAT	024	018	and let not the one in the field turn back to take his garment.
040	MAT	024	019	But alas unto those who are in gestation and nursing in those days.
040	MAT	024	020	But pray that your flight may not be in the winter, nor on the Sabbath.
040	MAT	024	021	For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world even until now nor ever may be.
040	MAT	024	022	And if those days were not shortened, no life would be saved: but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened.
040	MAT	024	023	Then if any one may say to you, Lo, here is Christ, or, there: believe him not:
040	MAT	024	024	for false Christs and false prophets will rise up, and give great signs and wonders; so as to deceive even the elect, if possible.
040	MAT	024	025	Behold, I have foretold you.
040	MAT	024	026	Therefore if they may say to you, Behold, He is in the desert; go not out: Behold, He is in the secret chambers; believe them not.
040	MAT	024	027	For as the lightning comes from the east, and shines even unto the west; so also shall the coming of the Son of man be.
040	MAT	024	028	For where the carcass is, there the eagles will be gathered together.
040	MAT	024	029	And immediately, after the desolation of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give her light, and the stars will fall from the heavens, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.
040	MAT	024	030	And then the sign of the Son of man will appear in the heaven: and all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and will see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and much glory.
040	MAT	024	031	And He will send forth His angels with a great trumpet, and they will gather His elect out of the four winds, from the extremities of the heavens, unto the extremities of the same.
040	MAT	024	032	But learn the parable from the fig-tree: when her branch may now be tender, and she may grow out leaves, know that the summer is nigh.
040	MAT	024	033	So you also, when you may see all these things know that it is at the doors.
040	MAT	024	034	Truly I say unto you, This race may not pass away until all these things may be fulfilled.
040	MAT	024	035	Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words can not pass away.
040	MAT	024	036	Concerning that day or hour no one knows, neither the angels of the heavens, except my Father only.
040	MAT	024	037	But as were the days of Noah, so indeed shall be the coming of the Son of man.
040	MAT	024	038	For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day on which Noah entered into the ark,
040	MAT	024	039	and they did not know until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall be the coming of the Son of man.
040	MAT	024	040	Then two men shall be in the field; one is taken, and one is left.
040	MAT	024	041	Two women will be grinding at the mill; one is taken, and one is left.
040	MAT	024	042	Watch therefore: because you do not know on what day your Lord cometh.
040	MAT	024	043	But know this, that if the landlord knew at what watch the thief cometh, he would have watched, and would not have permitted his house to be broken into.
040	MAT	024	044	Therefore be ye also ready: because the Son of man cometh in an hour at which you do not think.
040	MAT	024	045	Then who is the faithful and wise servant, whom the lord placed over his household to give them their food in season?
040	MAT	024	046	Happy is that servant whom, his lord having come, will find so doing.
040	MAT	024	047	Truly I say unto you, that he will appoint him over all his possessions.
040	MAT	024	048	But if the wicked servant may say in his heart,
040	MAT	024	049	My lord delayeth; and may begin to smite his fellow-servants, and eat and drink with the drunken;
040	MAT	024	050	the lord of that servant will come in a day in which he does not expect, and an hour in which he does not know,
040	MAT	024	051	and he will cut him off, and will appoint his part with hypocrites: and there shall be weeping and gnashing of the teeth.
040	MAT	025	001	Then shall the kingdom of the heavens be likened unto ten virgins, who taking their lamps, went out to meet the bridegroom.
040	MAT	025	002	And five of them were foolish, and five were wise.
040	MAT	025	003	For the foolish, taking their lamps, took no oil with themselves:
040	MAT	025	004	and the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
040	MAT	025	005	But the bridegroom tarrying, they all nodded and slept.
040	MAT	025	006	And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom! go ye out to meet him.
040	MAT	025	007	Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.
040	MAT	025	008	And the foolish said to the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are going out.
040	MAT	025	009	And the wise responded, saying, No, lest there may not be a sufficiency for us and you: go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.
040	MAT	025	010	And they going to buy, the bridegroom came; and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage, and the door was shut.
040	MAT	025	011	And afterwards the other virgins come, saying; Lord, lord, open unto us.
040	MAT	025	012	And he responding, said; Truly I say unto you, I know you not.
040	MAT	025	013	Watch therefore, because you know neither the day nor the hour.
040	MAT	025	014	For as a man going away, called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods,
040	MAT	025	015	to one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to each one according to his own ability; and departed.
040	MAT	025	016	The one having received the five talents going immediately, operated with the same, and made other five talents.
040	MAT	025	017	Likewise the one having received two gained two others.
040	MAT	025	018	And he having received one, having gone away, digged up the earth, and buried the money belonging to his lord.
040	MAT	025	019	And after a long time the lord of those servants comes, and makes a reckoning with them.
040	MAT	025	020	And the one having received the five talents coming to him brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou didst deliver unto me five talents: behold, I have gained other five talents.
040	MAT	025	021	His lord said to him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou wast faithful over few things, and I will make thee ruler over many things: come thou into the joy of thy lord.
040	MAT	025	022	And the one having received two talents, coming to him, said, Lord, thou didst deliver unto me two talents: behold, I have gained other two talents.
040	MAT	025	023	And his lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou wast faithful over few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: come thou into the joy of thy lord.
040	MAT	025	024	And the one having received one talent also coming, said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strewn:
040	MAT	025	025	and being afraid, having gone away, I hid thy talent in the earth: behold, thou hast thine own.
040	MAT	025	026	And his Lord responding said to him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, didst thou know that I gather where I have not sown, and reap where I have not strewn?
040	MAT	025	027	Therefore it behooved thee to put my money in the bank, and having come, I would receive my own with the product.
040	MAT	025	028	Therefore take the talent from him, and give it to the one having ten talents.
040	MAT	025	029	For to every one having it shall be given, and he shall superabound: but from the one not having shall be taken away even that which he has.
040	MAT	025	030	And cast ye the unprofitable servant into the darkness which is without: and there shall be weeping and gnashing of the teeth.
040	MAT	025	031	But when the Son of min may come in His glory, and all His angels with Him, then will He sit upon the throne of His glory:
040	MAT	025	032	and all nations shall be gathered before Him: and He will separate them from one another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats:
040	MAT	025	033	and He will place the sheep on His right, and the goats on His left.
040	MAT	025	034	Then the King will say to those on His right, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom which has been prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
040	MAT	025	035	For I was hungry, and you gave me to eat: I was thirsty, and you gave me drink: I was a stranger, and you took me in;
040	MAT	025	036	was naked, and ye clothed me: was sick, and ye visited me: was in prison, and ye came unto me.
040	MAT	025	037	Then the righteous will respond to Him, saying; Lord, when saw we thee then hungry, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?
040	MAT	025	038	And when saw we thee then a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?
040	MAT	025	039	But when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?
040	MAT	025	040	And the King responding will say unto them, Truly I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did these things to one of the least of these my brethren, you did them unto me.
040	MAT	025	041	Then will He also say unto those on the left, Depart from me, ye cursed, into eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels.
040	MAT	025	042	For I was hungry, and you gave me nothing to eat: I was thirsty, and you gave me nothing to drink:
040	MAT	025	043	I was a stranger and you took me not in; was naked, and you clothed me not; was sick, and in prison, and you visited me not.
040	MAT	025	044	Then will they also respond, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and ministered not unto thee?
040	MAT	025	045	Then will He respond to them, saying, Truly I say unto you, Inasmuch as you did not these things to one of the least of these, you did them not unto me.
040	MAT	025	046	And these shall go away into eternal punishment: and the righteous into eternal life.
040	MAT	026	001	And it came to pass, when Jesus finished these discourses, He said to His disciples,
040	MAT	026	002	You know that after two days is the passover, and the Son of man is delivered to be crucified.
040	MAT	026	003	Then the chief priests, and scribes, and elders of the people, were assembled in the hall of the high priest, called Caiaphas.
040	MAT	026	004	And they immediately passed the verdict that they would take Jesus by stratagem, and kill Him.
040	MAT	026	005	But they said, Not at the feast, lest there be an uproar among the people.
040	MAT	026	006	And Jesus being in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
040	MAT	026	007	a woman having an alabaster box of myrrh, very valuable, came to Him and poured it on His head, while sitting at the table.
040	MAT	026	008	And His disciples, seeing, were indignant, saying, For what was this waste?
040	MAT	026	009	For this was able to be sold for much, and given to the poor.
040	MAT	026	010	And Jesus knowing, said to them, Why do you give the woman trouble? because she hath wrought a beautiful work in me.
040	MAT	026	011	For you have the poor with you always; but you have not me always.
040	MAT	026	012	For she pouring this myrrh on my body, did it in order to my burial.
040	MAT	026	013	Truly I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel may be preached in all the world, that which she did shall indeed be spoken of for a memorial of her.
040	MAT	026	014	Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, going to the chief priests,
040	MAT	026	015	said, What do you wish to give me, and I will deliver Him to you? And they offered him thirty pieces of silver.
040	MAT	026	016	And from that time he was seeking opportunity that he might betray Him.
040	MAT	026	017	On the first day of the unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to Him; Where do you wish that we may prepare for you to eat the passover?
040	MAT	026	018	And He said; Go into the city to a certain one, and say to him; The Teacher says; My time is nigh; I make the passover with you along with my disciples.
040	MAT	026	019	And the disciples did as Jesus commanded them, and prepared the passover.
040	MAT	026	020	And it being evening, He sat down at the table with the twelve.
040	MAT	026	021	And they eating, He said; Truly, I say unto you, that one of you will betray me.
040	MAT	026	022	And they being exceedingly sorrowful, began each one of them to say to Him, Lord, whether am I the one?
040	MAT	026	023	And responding He said, The one dipping his hand in the dish with me, the same shall betray me.
040	MAT	026	024	Indeed the Son of man goeth, as has been written concerning Him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It was good for him if that man had never been born.
040	MAT	026	025	But Judas, the one betraying Him, responding said, Master, whether am I the one? He says to him, Thou hast said it.
040	MAT	026	026	And they eating, Jesus taking the bread, and blessing it, broke, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.
040	MAT	026	027	Also taking the cup, and blessing it, He gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all, of it;
040	MAT	026	028	for this is my blood which belongs to the new covenant, which is shed for many unto the remission of sin.
040	MAT	026	029	And I say unto you, that I shall no more drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I may drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father.
040	MAT	026	030	Having sung a hymn, they went out into the Mount of Olives.
040	MAT	026	031	Then Jesus says to them, You will all be offended in me this night: for it has been written, I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered.
040	MAT	026	032	And after I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.
040	MAT	026	033	But Peter responding said to Him, If all shall be offended in thee, I will never be offended.
040	MAT	026	034	Jesus said to him, Truly I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock shall crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.
040	MAT	026	035	And Peter says to Him, If it may be necessary for me to die with thee, I will not deny thee. Likewise also all the disciples said.
040	MAT	026	036	Then Jesus comes with them into a place called Gethsemane, and He says to His disciples, Sit here, until I having gone may pray there.
040	MAT	026	037	And taking Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, He began to grieve and to be dejected.
040	MAT	026	038	Then He says to them, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even unto death: abide here, and pray with me.
040	MAT	026	039	And having gone forward a little, He fell on His face, praying, and saying, My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me: moreover not as I will, but as thou wilt.
040	MAT	026	040	And He comes to the disciples, and finds them sleeping, and says to Peter, Were you not able to watch with me one hour?
040	MAT	026	041	Watch and pray, that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
040	MAT	026	042	And again the second time, having gone away, He prayed, saying, My Father, if it is possible that this cup pass from me, if I shall not drink it, let thy will be done.
040	MAT	026	043	And having come He finds them again sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.
040	MAT	026	044	And leaving them, having gone away, He prayed again the third time, speaking the same word.
040	MAT	026	045	Then He comes to His disciples, and says to them, Sleep on, and take your rest, behold, the hour is nigh, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners:
040	MAT	026	046	arise, let us go: behold, the one having betrayed me is nigh.
040	MAT	026	047	And He still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.
040	MAT	026	048	And the one having betrayed Him gave them a sign, saying, The one whom I shall kiss, is He: hold Him fast.
040	MAT	026	049	And immediately coming forward to Jesus, he said, Hail, Master; and kissed Him copiously.
040	MAT	026	050	And Jesus said to him, Comrade, unto what do you come? Then having come forward they laid hands on Him, and bound Him.
040	MAT	026	051	And behold, one of those along with Jesus, reaching out his hand, drew his sword, and smiting the servant of the high priest, cut off his ear.
040	MAT	026	052	Then Jesus says to him, Turn away thy sword into its place; for all taking the sword shall perish by the sword.
040	MAT	026	053	Whether do you think that I am not able now to call upon my Father, and He will send me more than twelve legions of angels?
040	MAT	026	054	How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled, because it is necessary thus to be done?
040	MAT	026	055	And at that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, You have come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to take me: daily did I sit with you, teaching in the temple, and you did not arrest me:
040	MAT	026	056	but all this took place that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then the disciples all leaving Him, fled away.
040	MAT	026	057	Taking Jesus they led Him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the chief priests and elders were assembled together.
040	MAT	026	058	And Peter followed Him a long way off, into the court of the high priest, and having come in, was sitting with the officers, to see the end.
040	MAT	026	059	And the high priests and all the sanhedrim were seeking false testimony against Jesus, in order that they might kill Him.
040	MAT	026	060	And they found none. And many false witnesses having come forward, they found none.
040	MAT	026	061	And afterwards two false witnesses having come forward, said, He said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and build it in three days.
040	MAT	026	062	And the high priest rising, said to Him, Do you respond nothing? what are they witnessing against you?
040	MAT	026	063	And Jesus was silent; and the high priest responding said to Him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us if thou art the Christ, the Son of God.
040	MAT	026	064	Jesus says to him, Thou didst say it. Moreover I say unto you, that, Hereafter you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.
040	MAT	026	065	Then the high priest tore his robes, saying, He blasphemed: why have we yet need of witnesses? behold, now you heard His blasphemy:
040	MAT	026	066	what seems to you? They responding said, He is worthy of death.
040	MAT	026	067	They spat in His face, and buffeted Him: and they slapped Him,
040	MAT	026	068	saying, Prophesy unto us, who is the one smiting thee?
040	MAT	026	069	And Peter was sitting without in the court. And a certain maidservant came to him, saying, Truly, thou wast with Jesus the Galilean.
040	MAT	026	070	And he denied before all, I know not what you say.
040	MAT	026	071	And another maidservant saw him, having come to the gate, and says to them there, This man was with Jesus the Nazarene.
040	MAT	026	072	And again he denied with an oath, I know not the man.
040	MAT	026	073	And after a little the bystanders coming to Peter, said, Truly, thou art also one of them, for indeed thy speech betrays thee.
040	MAT	026	074	Then he began to anathematize and to swear, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.
040	MAT	026	075	And Peter remembered the word of Jesus having spoken to him, That before the cock shall crow, thou wilt deny me thrice. And having gone out, he wept bitterly.
040	MAT	027	001	And it being morning, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put Him to death.
040	MAT	027	002	And having bound Him, took Him away, and delivered Him to Pontius Pilate, the governor.
040	MAT	027	003	Then Judas, the one having betrayed Him, seeing that He was condemned, being seized with remorse, returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
040	MAT	027	004	saying, I sinned betraying the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? See thou to it.
040	MAT	027	005	And throwing down the money in the temple, he departed; and having gone away hung himself.
040	MAT	027	006	And the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, It is not lawful to put them in the treasury, because it is the price of blood.
040	MAT	027	007	And taking counsel, they purchased with them the field of the potter, for a burying place for strangers.
040	MAT	027	008	Therefore that field has been called, The field of blood, to this day.
040	MAT	027	009	Then the word having been spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, was fulfilled, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him that was valued, whom they of the sons of Israel did value;
040	MAT	027	010	and they gave them for the field of the potter, as the Lord appointed me.
040	MAT	027	011	And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked Him, saying; Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said to him, Thou sayest it.
040	MAT	027	012	And while He is accused by the chief priests and elders, He responded nothing.
040	MAT	027	013	Then Pilate says to Him, Do you not hear, bow many things they witness against you?
040	MAT	027	014	And He responded to him not one word, so that the governor marveled exceedingly.
040	MAT	027	015	And the governor during the feast was accustomed to release to the multitude one prisoner, whom they wished.
040	MAT	027	016	But they had at that time a noted prisoner called Barabbas.
040	MAT	027	017	Then they being assembled, Pilate said to them, Whom do you wish that I may release unto you? Barabbas? or Jesus who is called Christ?
040	MAT	027	018	For he knew that they delivered Him on account of envy.
040	MAT	027	019	And he sitting on his tribunal, his wife sent to him, saying, Let there be nothing to thee and that just man: for this day I suffered many things in a dream on account of Him.
040	MAT	027	020	And the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.
040	MAT	027	021	And the governor responding said to them, Which of the two do you wish that I shall release unto you? And they said Barabbas.
040	MAT	027	022	Pilate says to them, Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ? They all say to him, Let Him be crucified.
040	MAT	027	023	And the governor said, For what evil hath He done? And they continued to cry out more vociferously, saying, Let Him be crucified.
040	MAT	027	024	And Pilate seeing that he profits nothing, but rather an uproar supervenes, having taken water, washed his hands in the presence of the multitude, saying, For I am free from the blood of this just one: you shall see to it.
040	MAT	027	025	And all the people responding said, His blood be upon us, and upon our children.
040	MAT	027	026	Then he released unto them Barabbas. And having scourged Jesus, delivered Him up that He should be crucified.
040	MAT	027	027	Then the soldiers of the governor taking Jesus into the judgment hall, gathered to Him the whole band.
040	MAT	027	028	And having divested Him, put on Him a scarlet robe:
040	MAT	027	029	and plaiting a crown of thorns put it on His head, and a reed in His right hand; and bowing the knee to Him, continued to mock Him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!
040	MAT	027	030	And spitting on Him, they took the reed and struck Him on the head repeatedly.
040	MAT	027	031	And when they mocked Him, divesting Him of the robe, they put on Him His own raiment, and led Him away to crucify Him.
040	MAT	027	032	And going out they found a Cyrenean man, Simon by name: they compelled him that he should bear His cross.
040	MAT	027	033	Having come to the place called Golgotha, which is called the place of a skull.
040	MAT	027	034	And they gave Him vinegar mingled with gall to drink: and tasting, He was not willing to drink it.
040	MAT	027	035	And crucifying Him, they divided His garments, casting the lot,
040	MAT	027	036	and sitting down, they continued to watch Him there.
040	MAT	027	037	And they placed over His head, His accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
040	MAT	027	038	Then two thieves are crucified along with Him, the one on the right and one on the left.
040	MAT	027	039	And going by they continued to blaspheme Him, wagging their heads,
040	MAT	027	040	and saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself: if thou art the Son of God, come down from the cross.
040	MAT	027	041	Likewise also the chief priests mocking, with the scribes and elders, continued to say,
040	MAT	027	042	He saved others; He is not able to save Himself: if He is the King of Israel, let Him now come down from the cross, and we will believe on Him.
040	MAT	027	043	He trusted in God; let Him now deliver Him, if He wishes Him; for He said, I am the Son of God.
040	MAT	027	044	And the thieves being crucified along with Him were also reproaching Him in the same manner.
040	MAT	027	045	And from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.
040	MAT	027	046	And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
040	MAT	027	047	And certain ones of those standing there hearing, said, He is calling Elijah.
040	MAT	027	048	And one of them running and taking a sponge, and filling it with vinegar, and extending it on a reed, gave Him drink.
040	MAT	027	049	And others were saying, Let Him alone; let us see if Elijah comes about to save Him.
040	MAT	027	050	And Jesus again crying with a loud voice, gave up His spirit.
040	MAT	027	051	And behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from top to bottom, and the earth did quake; and the rocks were rent;
040	MAT	027	052	and the tombs were opened; and many bodies of the sleeping saints arose;
040	MAT	027	053	and having come out of the tombs after His resurrection came into the holy city and appeared unto many.
040	MAT	027	054	And the centurion and those watching Jesus with him, seeing the earthquake, and the things which took place, feared exceedingly, saying, Surely this was the Son of God.
040	MAT	027	055	And many women were there looking on from a distance, who followed Jesus from Galilee to minister unto Him,
040	MAT	027	056	among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary, the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
040	MAT	027	057	And it being evening, a rich man came from Arimathea, whose name was Joseph, who himself also was a disciple to Jesus.
040	MAT	027	058	He having come to Pilate, begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded that the body should be given:
040	MAT	027	059	and Joseph having received the body, wrapped it in clean linen,
040	MAT	027	060	and placed it in a new sepulcher, which he hewed in the rock: and having rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulcher, departed.
040	MAT	027	061	And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting in front of the tomb.
040	MAT	027	062	And on the following day, which is after the Preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together to Pilate, saying,
040	MAT	027	063	Lord, we remember that that deceiver, while yet living, said, After three days I will rise.
040	MAT	027	064	Command therefore that the tomb be made safe until the third day, lest His disciples having come, may steal Him away, and say to the people, He is risen from the dead: and the last error shall be worse than the first.
040	MAT	027	065	Pilate said to them, You have a watch: go, make it safe as you know.
040	MAT	027	066	And having gone, they secured the tomb, sealing the stone, with the guard.
040	MAT	028	001	And late on the Sabbath-day, on the dawn toward the first of the Sabbaths, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the sepulcher.
040	MAT	028	002	And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel descending from heaven, having come rolled away the stone from the door, and sat upon it.
040	MAT	028	003	And his countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow.
040	MAT	028	004	And from fear of him the keepers did quake, and they became like dead men.
040	MAT	028	005	And the angel responding, said to the women, Be ye not afraid: for I know that you are seeking Jesus, who has been crucified.
040	MAT	028	006	He is not here; for He is risen, as He said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.
040	MAT	028	007	And going quickly, tell His disciples, that He is risen from the dead; and behold, He goes before you into Galilee; and there you shall see Him; lo, I have told you.
040	MAT	028	008	And having come out quickly from the sepulcher with fear and great joy, they were running to tell His disciples.
040	MAT	028	009	And behold, Jesus met them, saying, Hail. And they having come forward, took hold of His feet, and worshiped Him.
040	MAT	028	010	Then Jesus says to them, Fear not: go tell my brethren, that they may depart into Galilee, and there they shall see me.
040	MAT	028	011	And they going, behold, certain ones of the watch having come into the city, proclaimed to the chief priests all things which had taken place.
040	MAT	028	012	And being assembled along with the elders, and taking counsel, they gave much money to the soldiers,
040	MAT	028	013	saying, You tell, that His disciples, having come by night, stole Him away while we slept.
040	MAT	028	014	And if this may be heard by the governor, we will persuade him and make you secure.
040	MAT	028	015	And they having received the money, did as they were instructed: and this report is current among the Jews until this day.
040	MAT	028	016	And the eleven disciples went away into Galilee into the mountain where Jesus commanded them:
040	MAT	028	017	and seeing Him, they worshiped Him: but some doubted.
040	MAT	028	018	And Jesus having come spoke to them, saying, All authority is given unto me in heaven and upon earth.
040	MAT	028	019	Going, disciple all nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost:
040	MAT	028	020	teaching them to observe all things which I commanded you. And lo, I am with you all the days, unto the end of the age.

# BOOK	041	MAR	Mark	Mark
041	MAR	001	001	The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
041	MAR	001	002	As has been written in the prophets; Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who will prepare thy way before thee;
041	MAR	001	003	the voice of one roaring in the wilderness; Prepare ye the way of the Lord; make His paths straight.
041	MAR	001	004	John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness the baptism of repentance unto the remission of sins.
041	MAR	001	005	And all the Judean country and the Jerusalemites were going out unto him, and were being baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
041	MAR	001	006	And John was clothed with camel's hair and a leathern girdle about his loins, and eating locusts and wild honey;
041	MAR	001	007	And he proclaimed, saying, I indeed baptized you with water; but One cometh after me more powerful than I; the latchet of His sandals I am not worthy, having stooped down, to loose,
041	MAR	001	008	and He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.
041	MAR	001	009	And it came to pass in those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
041	MAR	001	010	And coming up straightway from the water, He saw the heavens open and the Spirit like a dove descending on Him.
041	MAR	001	011	And there was a voice from the heavens: Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I delight.
041	MAR	001	012	And immediately the Spirit casts Him out into the wilderness.
041	MAR	001	013	And he was in the wilderness forty days being tempted by Satan, and was with the wild beasts; and the angels continued to minister unto Him.
041	MAR	001	014	After that John was cast into prison, Jesus came into Galilee preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,
041	MAR	001	015	and saying, That the time is fulfilled: the kingdom of God is at hand: repent, and believe the gospel.
041	MAR	001	016	And walking by the sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting their net in the sea: for they were fishers.
041	MAR	001	017	Jesus said to them, Come after me, and I will make you to be fishers of men.
041	MAR	001	018	And immediately, having left their nets, they followed Him.
041	MAR	001	019	And going forth thence a little, He saw James, the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, themselves also in a ship mending their nets,
041	MAR	001	020	and immediately He called them. And having left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired hands, they departed after Him.
041	MAR	001	021	And they come into Capernaum; and immediately on the Sabbath, He was teaching in the synagogue.
041	MAR	001	022	And they were astonished at His teaching; for Ile was teaching them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.
041	MAR	001	023	And there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,
041	MAR	001	024	saying, Let me alone; what is there to us and thee, thou Jesus, the Nazarene? You have come to destroy us; I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.
041	MAR	001	025	And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be silent, and come out from him.
041	MAR	001	026	And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a great voice, came out from him.
041	MAR	001	027	And they were all astonished, so that they were inquiring one to another, saying, What is this? what new teaching is this? Because according to authority He commands the unclean spirits, and they obey Him;
041	MAR	001	028	and His fame went out immediately into all the surrounding country of Galilee.
041	MAR	001	029	And immediately, having come out from the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
041	MAR	001	030	And the mother-in-law of Simon was lying down burning with fever; and immediately they speak to Him concerning her:
041	MAR	001	031	And having come to her, taking her by the hand, He raised her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she continued to minister unto them.
041	MAR	001	032	And it being evening, when the sun went down, they were carrying to Him all the sick and demonized;
041	MAR	001	033	and the whole city was gathered to the door.
041	MAR	001	034	And He healed many who were afflicted with various diseases, and He cast out many demons; and did not suffer the demons to speak, because they knew Him.
041	MAR	001	035	And in the morning, exceedingly early, while it was yet night, having arisen up He came out, and went away into a desert place, and was praying there.
041	MAR	001	036	And Simon and those who were with him followed Him.
041	MAR	001	037	And they found Him, and say to Him, All are seeking after thee.
041	MAR	001	038	And He says to them, Let us go into the surrounding villages and cities, that I may preach there; for unto this I have come out.
041	MAR	001	039	And He was preaching in their synagogues in all Galilee, and casting out the demons.
041	MAR	001	040	And a leper comes to Him, entreating Him, and bowing the knee to Him, and saying to Him, That if thou mayest be willing, thou art able to cleanse me.
041	MAR	001	041	And Jesus being moved with compassion, reaching forth His hand, touched him, and says to him, I will; be thou cleansed.
041	MAR	001	042	And He speaking, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.
041	MAR	001	043	And charging him, He immediately sent him away,
041	MAR	001	044	and says to him, See that you may speak nothing to any one: but go, show thyself unto the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.
041	MAR	001	045	And he having gone out, began to proclaim many things, and to publish abroad the word, so that He was no longer able openly to come into the city, but was out in desert places: and they continued to come to Him from all directions.
041	MAR	002	001	And again He having come into Capernaum during those days; and it was heard that He was in the house.
041	MAR	002	002	And immediately many were assembled together, so that there was no room, even at the door; and He was speaking the word to them.
041	MAR	002	003	And they come to Him, carrying a paralytic, borne by four.
041	MAR	002	004	And not being able to come near Him on account of the crowd, they opened the roof where He was: and having lifted it up, they let down the bed on which the paralytic was lying.
041	MAR	002	005	And Jesus seeing their faith says to the paralytic, Child, thy sins are forgiven thee.
041	MAR	002	006	And certain ones of the scribes were sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,
041	MAR	002	007	Why does He speak blasphemies? Who is able to forgive sins, except the one God?
041	MAR	002	008	And Jesus immediately knowing in His spirit that they are thus reasoning among themselves, said to them, Why do you thus reason in your hearts?
041	MAR	002	009	Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, Thy sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise, and take thy bed, and walk about?
041	MAR	002	010	But in order that you may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins
041	MAR	002	011	(He says to the paralytic), I say unto thee, Arise, take thy bed, and go into thy house.
041	MAR	002	012	And he arose immediately, and having taken the bed, went out before them all. So that all were astonished, and glorified God, saying, Never have we seen it after this sort.
041	MAR	002	013	And He came out again by the sea; and the whole multitude came to Him, and He was teaching them.
041	MAR	002	014	And passing along, he saw Levi, the son of Alpheus sitting at the toll, and says to him, Follow me. And rising up, he followed Him.
041	MAR	002	015	And it came to pass, while He was sitting at the table in his house, and many publicans and sinners were sitting along with Jesus and his disciples: for they were many, and they followed Him.
041	MAR	002	016	And the scribes and Pharisees, seeing Him eating with the publicans and sinners, were saying to His disciples, Why does He eat and drink with publicans and sinners?
041	MAR	002	017	Jesus hearing, says to them, They that are whole have no need of a physician, but they that are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
041	MAR	002	018	The disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting. And they come and say to Him; Wherefore do the disciples of John and the Pharisees fast, and thy disciples do not fast?
041	MAR	002	019	And Jesus said to them, Whether are the sons of the bride-chamber able to fast while the bridegroom is with them? So long a time as they have with them the bridegroom they are not able to fast.
041	MAR	002	020	But the days will come, when the bridegroom must be taken from them, and then they will fast in that day.
041	MAR	002	021	No one putteth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: lest the new take its fullness from the old, and the rent is made worse.
041	MAR	002	022	No one puts new wine in old bottles: lest the new wine shall break the bottles, and the wine is poured out, and the bottles shall perish: but the new wine is put in new bottles.
041	MAR	002	023	And it came to pass, that He was traveling through the corn-fields on the Sabbath-day; and His disciples began to make the journey plucking the ears.
041	MAR	002	024	And the Pharisees continued to say to Him, Behold what they are doing on the Sabbath, which is not lawful.
041	MAR	002	025	And He said to them, Have ye not read what David did, when he had need, and was hungry, and those with him?
041	MAR	002	026	How he entered into the house of God, in the days of Abiathar, the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat except for the priest, and he gave it to those being with him?
041	MAR	002	027	And He said to them, The Sabbath was made for the sake of man, and not man for the sake of the Sabbath.
041	MAR	002	028	So the Son of man is also Lord of the Sabbath.
041	MAR	003	001	He came again into the synagogue, a man was there having a withered hand.
041	MAR	003	002	And they were watching Him, if He will heal him on the Sabbath, that they might accuse Him.
041	MAR	003	003	And He says to the man having a withered hand; Rise up in the midst.
041	MAR	003	004	And He says to them; Is it lawful to do good or to do evil on the Sabbath; to save life, or to kill? And they were silent.
041	MAR	003	005	And looking round on them with indignation, being grieved over the hardness of their hearts, He says to the man; Reach forth thy hand. And he reached it forth and it was restored.
041	MAR	003	006	And the Pharisees, having gone out immediately along with the Herodians, took counsel against Him in order that they might kill Him.
041	MAR	003	007	And Jesus departed with His disciples to the sea: and a great multitude followed Him from Galilee, and from Judea,
041	MAR	003	008	and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and from beyond the Jordan, and those about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, hearing so many things that He was doing, came to Him.
041	MAR	003	009	And He said to His disciples, that a little boat should wait on Him in order that they may not tread on Him.
041	MAR	003	010	For He healed many; so that they were falling before Him so that they might touch Him, so many as had diseases.
041	MAR	003	011	And unclean spirits, when they saw Him, fell down before Him, and were crying out, saying, Thou art the Son of God.
041	MAR	003	012	And He charged them much that they should not make Him known.
041	MAR	003	013	And He goes up into the mountain, and calls whom He wished: and they went away to Him.
041	MAR	003	014	And He made twelve (apostles) that they may be with Him and that He may send them out to preach,
041	MAR	003	015	and to have power to heal diseases, and to cast out the demons.
041	MAR	003	016	And He placed the name Peter on Simon;
041	MAR	003	017	and James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and on them He placed the names Boanerges, which is, Sons of thunder:
041	MAR	003	018	and Andrew and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot,
041	MAR	003	019	who also betrayed Him.
041	MAR	003	020	And He comes into a house; and the multitude come together again so they are not able to eat bread.
041	MAR	003	021	And those along with Him hearing came out to arrest Him: for they continued to say, He is beside Himself.
041	MAR	003	022	And the scribes having come down from Jerusalem were saving, He has Beelzebul and He is casting out the demons through the prince of the demons.
041	MAR	003	023	And calling them to Him, He continued to speak to them in parables, How is Satan able to cast out Satan?
041	MAR	003	024	And if a kingdom may be divided against itself, that kingdom is not able to stand,
041	MAR	003	025	and if a house may be divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand;
041	MAR	003	026	and if Satan stand up against himself, and is divided, he is not able to stand, but has an end.
041	MAR	003	027	No one is able, having entered into the house of a strong man, to spoil his goods, unless he may first bind the strong man, and then he will spoil his house.
041	MAR	003	028	Truly I say unto you, that all sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies whatsoever they may blaspheme:
041	MAR	003	029	but whosoever may blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is subject of eternal condemnation.
041	MAR	003	030	Because they were saying, He has an unclean spirit.
041	MAR	003	031	And His mother and His brothers come; and standing without, sent to Him, calling Him.
041	MAR	003	032	And the crowd was sitting round Him; and they say to Him, Behold thy mother and thy brothers without are seeking thee.
041	MAR	003	033	And He responding to them, says, Who is my mother and my brothers?
041	MAR	003	034	And looking round on His disciples sitting about Him in a circle, He says, Behold my mother and my brothers!
041	MAR	003	035	For whosoever may do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and my mother.
041	MAR	004	001	And again He began to teach by the sea: and a great multitude is gathered unto Him, so that He having gone into a ship, sat on the sea; and the whole multitude was at the sea on the land.
041	MAR	004	002	And He was teaching them many things in parables, and in His teaching He said to them,
041	MAR	004	003	Hear: Behold, a sower went out to sow:
041	MAR	004	004	and it came to pass while he was sowing, some fell by the wayside, and the fowls came and devoured it.
041	MAR	004	005	And other fell upon stones, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:
041	MAR	004	006	and when the sun arose, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.
041	MAR	004	007	And other fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up, and choked it, and it gave no fruit.
041	MAR	004	008	And other fell in good ground, and springing up and growing, gave fruit, and produced, one thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundred.
041	MAR	004	009	And He said, Let the one having ears to hear, hear.
041	MAR	004	010	And when they were alone, and those around Him along with the twelve asked Him the parable.
041	MAR	004	011	And He said to them, To you it has been given the mystery of the kingdom of God: but to them who are without, all things are in parables:
041	MAR	004	012	in order that seeing they may see, and not know; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest they may turn, and their sins may he forgiven unto them.
041	MAR	004	013	And He says to them, Do you not understand this parable? and how will you know all parables?
041	MAR	004	014	The sower sows the word.
041	MAR	004	015	And those who are by the way-side, where the word is sown; and when they hear it, immediately Satan comes, and takes away the word which was sown in their hearts.
041	MAR	004	016	And those who are sowed upon the rocks are likewise, those who, when they may hear the word, immediately with joy receive it.
041	MAR	004	017	And they have no root in themselves, but are temporary; then tribulation or persecution arising on account of the word, they are immediately offended:
041	MAR	004	018	and others are those who are sown among the thorns; they are those hearing the word,
041	MAR	004	019	and the cares of the age, and the deceitfulness of riches, and desires concerning other things coming into them, choke out the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
041	MAR	004	020	And these are they who are sown on good ground; whosoever hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirty, some sixty, and some a hundred.
041	MAR	004	021	And He said to them; Whether does the light come, that it may be placed under a bushel, or under a bed? is it not that it may be placed on a candlestick?
041	MAR	004	022	For there is nothing hidden which may not be made manifest; neither is there any thing concealed, but that it may come into the light.
041	MAR	004	023	If any one has ears to hear, let him hear.
041	MAR	004	024	And He said to them. See what you hear: with what measure you measure it shall be measured unto you: and it shall be added unto you who hear.
041	MAR	004	025	For whosoever has, it shall be given unto him: and he who has not, it shall be taken from him even that which he has.
041	MAR	004	026	And He said, Thus is the kingdom of God, as a man may cast seed on the ground;
041	MAR	004	027	and he may sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed germinates and grows, as he does not know.
041	MAR	004	028	The earth spontaneously brings forth fruit; first the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the ear.
041	MAR	004	029	And when the fruit may develop, immediately he thrusts in the sickle, because the harvest is at hand.
041	MAR	004	030	And He said, To what may we liken the kingdom of God? or in what parable may we present it?
041	MAR	004	031	Tis like a grain of mustard seed, which when it may be sown upon the earth, is the smallest of all seeds which are upon the earth,
041	MAR	004	032	and when it may be sowed, it springs up, and becomes the greatest of herbs, and produces great branches; so that the birds of the heavens are able to lodge under its shadow.
041	MAR	004	033	And in many such parables He continued to speak the word to them, as they were able to hear.
041	MAR	004	034	And without a parable He did not speak to them: and He privately expounded all things to His disciples.
041	MAR	004	035	And He says to them, on that day, it being evening, Let us go away to the other side.
041	MAR	004	036	And leaving the multitude, they receive Him, as He was in the ship; and other ships were also with Him.
041	MAR	004	037	And there was a great storm of wind: and the waves were dashing into the ship, so that it was already filled.
041	MAR	004	038	And He was in the stern, sleeping on a pillow: and they awaken Him, and say to Him; Teacher, is there no care to thee that we perish?
041	MAR	004	039	And being awakened, He said to the sea, Be calm, be quiet. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
041	MAR	004	040	And He said to them, Why are you so cowardly? how have you not faith?
041	MAR	004	041	And they feared with a great fear, and continued to say to one another, Who then is this, because the wind and the sea obey Him?
041	MAR	005	001	And they came beyond the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes,
041	MAR	005	002	And a man from the tombs, with an unclean spirit met Him, having come out of the ship;
041	MAR	005	003	who had his dwelling among the tombs: neither was any one able to bind him with chains;
041	MAR	005	004	because frequently he had been bound with fetters and chains, and the chains were slipped off by him, and the fetters torn to pieces.
041	MAR	005	005	No one was able to tame him: and all the time, night and day, he was among the tombs in the mountains, crying, and cutting himself with stones.
041	MAR	005	006	And seeing Jesus a great way off, he ran to Him, and worshiped Him;
041	MAR	005	007	and crying with a loud voice, he says, What is there to me and to thee, O Jesus, thou Son of the Most High God? I adjure thee in the name of God, that you may not torment me.
041	MAR	005	008	For He said to him, Unclean spirit, come out from the man.
041	MAR	005	009	And He asked him, What is thy name? And he says to Him, My name is Legion; because we are many.
041	MAR	005	010	And he continued to intreat Him much, that He would not send them out of the country.
041	MAR	005	011	And there was a great herd of swine feeding in the mountain.
041	MAR	005	012	And they intreated Him, saying, Send us into the swine, in order that we may go into them.
041	MAR	005	013	And Jesus immediately permitted them. And the unclean spirits having gone out, came into the swine: and the herd rushed down a precipice into the sea, and there were about two thousand: and they were strangled in the sea.
041	MAR	005	014	And those herding them fled, and reported in the city, and in the country. And they came out to see what it was that came to pass.
041	MAR	005	015	And they come to Jesus, and see the demonized man sitting down, both clothed and in his right mind, the one called Legion; and they were afraid.
041	MAR	005	016	And those seeing, related to them how it happened to the demonized man and concerning the swine.
041	MAR	005	017	And they began to intreat Him to depart from their coasts.
041	MAR	005	018	And He having come to the ship, the demonized man intreated Him that he should be with Him.
041	MAR	005	019	And He did not permit him, but says to him, Go to thine own house to thy people, and proclaim to them how many things the Lord has done for thee, and had mercy on thee.
041	MAR	005	020	And he went away, and began to preach in Decapolis, how many things Jesus did to him. And all were astonished.
041	MAR	005	021	And Jesus crossing over in the ship again to the other side, a great multitude was gathered unto Him; and He was by the sea.
041	MAR	005	022	And one of the chief rulers of the synagogue, by name jairus, comes; and seeing Him falls at His feet,
041	MAR	005	023	and intreats Him much saying, My little daughter is at the point of death: that coming He may lay hands on her, in order that she may be saved and live.
041	MAR	005	024	And He departed with him; and a great multitude followed Him, even treading on Him.
041	MAR	005	025	And a certain woman, being in an issue of blood twelve years,
041	MAR	005	026	and having suffered much from many physicians, and expended all things which were with her, and being profited as to nothing, but rather having come to the worse,
041	MAR	005	027	hearing concerning Jesus, having come in the crowd behind, touched His garment.
041	MAR	005	028	For she was saying, If I may touch His garment, I shall be saved.
041	MAR	005	029	And immediately the issue of her blood was dried up: and she knew in her body that she is healed of her plague.
041	MAR	005	030	And immediately Jesus, knowing in Himself that the powerhas gone out from Him, turning in the crowd, said, Who touched my garments?
041	MAR	005	031	And His disciples continued to say to Him, You see the crowd treading upon you, and you say, Who touched me?
041	MAR	005	032	And He looked round to see her who did it.
041	MAR	005	033	And the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what has taken place unto herself, came and fell down before Him, and told Him the whole truth.
041	MAR	005	034	And He said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.
041	MAR	005	035	And He still speaking, they come from the house of the chief ruler of the synagogue, saying, Thy daughter is dead: why do you still trouble the Teacher?
041	MAR	005	036	And Jesus, immediately hearing the word spoken, says to the chief ruler, Fear not, only believe.
041	MAR	005	037	and He did not permit any one to accompany Him, except Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.
041	MAR	005	038	And He comes into the house of the chief ruler of the synagogue; And He sees a tumult, weeping and wailing much;
041	MAR	005	039	and having come in, He says to them, Why are you excited and weeping? The child is not dead, but sleepeth.
041	MAR	005	040	And they hooted at Him. And putting them all out, He takes the father and mother of the child and those with Him, and goes in where the child was.
041	MAR	005	041	And taking the child by the hand, says to her, Talitha cumi; which is interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, Arise.
041	MAR	005	042	And immediately the damsel stood up, and walked about; for she was twelve years old. And they were immediately delighted with great delight.
041	MAR	005	043	And He charged them much that no one should know it; and He said that something should be given to her to eat.
041	MAR	006	001	And He came out thence and comes into His own country; and His disciples follow Him:
041	MAR	006	002	and it being the Sabbath day, He began to preach in the synagogue: and many hearing were astonished, saying, Whence are these things to this one? and, What wisdom is given unto Him? Such miracles are wrought by His hands.
041	MAR	006	003	Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary? the brother of James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas? Are not His sisters here with us? And they were offended in Him.
041	MAR	006	004	And Jesus said to them; A prophet is not without honor except in his own country, and among his relatives, and in his own house.
041	MAR	006	005	And He was not able to do any miracle there, except laying hands on a few sick people, He healed them.
041	MAR	006	006	And He was astonished on account of their unbelief. And He went about the villages in a circuit teaching.
041	MAR	006	007	And He calls the twelve to Him, and began to send them out two by two; and He gave them authority over unclean spirits.
041	MAR	006	008	And He commanded them that they should take nothing for the way except staff only; no valise, no bread, no money in the girdle;
041	MAR	006	009	but having put on your sandals: and put not on two coats.
041	MAR	006	010	And He said to them, Into whatsoever house you may enter, there abide until you may go out from thence.
041	MAR	006	011	And whatsoever place may not receive you nor hear you, going forth thence, shake off the dust which is beneath your feet for a testimony unto them.
041	MAR	006	012	And having gone out they preached that they must repent;
041	MAR	006	013	and they cast out many demons; and anointed many sick with oil, and healed them.
041	MAR	006	014	And king Herod heard; for His name became known: and said, John the Baptist is risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works are wrought in Him.
041	MAR	006	015	And others continued to say, That He is Elijah; and others continued to say that He is a prophet, indeed one of the prophets.
041	MAR	006	016	But Herod hearing said, That, He is John, whom I beheaded; He is risen from the dead.
041	MAR	006	017	For Herod himself having sent, arrested John, and bound him in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip: because he married her.
041	MAR	006	018	For John said to Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have the wife of thy brother.
041	MAR	006	019	And Herodias hated him, and wished to kill him; and was not able;
041	MAR	006	020	for Herod was afraid of John, knowing him to be a just and holy man, and he continued to hold him in prison: and hearing him, he continued to do many things, and he was hearing him gladly.
041	MAR	006	021	And it being a high day, when Herod on his birthday made a feast to his mighty men, and chiliarchs, and the first men of Galilee;
041	MAR	006	022	and the daughter of Herodias herself, having come in and danced, and pleased Herod and those sitting with him; the king said to the damsel. Ask what you may wish, and I will give it to you.
041	MAR	006	023	And he promised her, I will give you whatsoever you may ask, even unto the half of my kingdom.
041	MAR	006	024	And having gone out, she said to her mother, What shall I ask And she said, The head of John the Baptist.
041	MAR	006	025	And she having come in to the king, immediately with haste asked him, saying; I wish, that you may give to me immediately, the head of John the Baptist in a charger.
041	MAR	006	026	And the king being grieved exceedingly; on account of his oaths, and those sitting with him, was not willing to reject her.
041	MAR	006	027	And the king immediately sending forth a soldier of his guard, commanded that his head should be brought.
041	MAR	006	028	And having departed, he beheaded him in prison: and brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel, and the damsel gave it to her mother.
041	MAR	006	029	And his disciples having heard, came and took his body, and put it in a sepulcher.
041	MAR	006	030	The apostles return to Jesus, and related unto Him all things, even so many as they did, and so many as they taught.
041	MAR	006	031	And He said to them, Come ye privately into a desert place, and rest a little while. For many were coming and going, neither had they leisure even to eat.
041	MAR	006	032	And they came away into a desert place privately in a ship.
041	MAR	006	033	And the multitudes saw them going, and many recognized them, and they ran together thither on foot from many cities, and came before them and came together to Him.
041	MAR	006	034	And Jesus having come out saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion in their behalf, because they were as sheep having no shepherd: and He began to teach them many things.
041	MAR	006	035	And already the hour being late, His disciples coming to Him, say, That it is a desert place, and the hour is already late:
041	MAR	006	036	send them away, that having gone into the surrounding country and the villages, they may purchase for themselves bread: for they have not what they may eat.
041	MAR	006	037	And responding He said to them, You give to them to eat. And they say to Him, Having gone away must we purchase the loaves of two hundred denaria, and give them to eat?
041	MAR	006	038	And He says to them; How many loaves have you? go and see. And having ascertained, they say, five loaves and two fishes.
041	MAR	006	039	And He commanded them all to sit down in companies on the green grass.
041	MAR	006	040	And they sat down in ranks, about one hundred, and about fifty.
041	MAR	006	041	And taking the five loaves and the two fishes, looking up to heaven, He blessed them; and broke the loaves, and gave them to His disciples, that they should dispense to them; and He divided the two fishes among all.
041	MAR	006	042	And they all ate, and were filled;
041	MAR	006	043	and they took up the fragments, twelve baskets full, and from the fishes.
041	MAR	006	044	And those eating the bread were five thousand men.
041	MAR	006	045	And immediately He constrained His disciples to embark into the ship, and go before Him to the other side to Bethsaida, until He shall send away the multitude.
041	MAR	006	046	And having dismissed them, He went away into the mountain to pray.
041	MAR	006	047	And it being evening, the ship was in the middle of the sea; and He was alone upon the land.
041	MAR	006	048	And He seeing them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary to them, and about the fourth watch of the night He comes to them, walking on the sea; and He wished to pass by them.
041	MAR	006	049	But they, seeing Him walking on the sea, thought it was a specter, and cried out.
041	MAR	006	050	For they all saw Him, and were alarmed. And immediately He spoke with them, and says to them, Be of good cheer; I am He; be not afraid.
041	MAR	006	051	And He went up to them into the ship; and the wind ceased. And they were exceedingly much astonished among themselves, and continued to marvel.
041	MAR	006	052	For they did not understand concerning the loaves, for their heart was hardened.
041	MAR	006	053	And having crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret; and they disembarked.
041	MAR	006	054	And they having come out from the ship, immediately recognizing Him,
041	MAR	006	055	they were running round all that country, and they began to carry the sick on beds, when they heard that He is there.
041	MAR	006	056	And when He departed into the villages, or cities, or countries, they placed the sick in the forums, and call upon Him, and continued to intreat Him that they should touch the hem of His garment: and so many as touched Him were saved.
041	MAR	007	001	And the Pharisees and certain ones of the scribes, having come from Jerusalem, gather to Him.
041	MAR	007	002	And seeing certain ones of His disciples eating bread with defiled, that is, unwashed hands.
041	MAR	007	003	For the Pharisees and all the Jews, unless they diligently wash their hands, do not eat, holding the tradition of the elders.
041	MAR	007	004	And from the forum, unless they may baptize themselves, they do not eat: and many other things which they have received to hold, the baptism of cups, and pots, and brazen vessels, and couches.
041	MAR	007	005	Then the Pharisees and scribes asked Him, Wherefore do not thy disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders: but they eat bread with unwashed hands?
041	MAR	007	006	And responding He said to them, Beautifully did Isaiah prophesy concerning you hypocrites, as has been written, This people honor me with lips, but their heart is far from me.
041	MAR	007	007	In vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.
041	MAR	007	008	For having left the commandment of God, you are holding the tradition of men.
041	MAR	007	009	And He said to them, Truly, you make void the commandment of God, that you may hold your own tradition.
041	MAR	007	010	For Moses said, Honor thy father and thy mother; and let the one speaking evil of father and mother die the death.
041	MAR	007	011	But you say, If a man may say to father or mother, Corban, that is a gift, whatsoever you may be profited by me;
041	MAR	007	012	and you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother;
041	MAR	007	013	making void the word of God by your tradition, which you have given: and you do many such similar things.
041	MAR	007	014	And calling the crowd to Him again, He said to them, Hear all ye, and understand.
041	MAR	007	015	There is nothing without a man coming into him, which is competent to defile him: but those things coming out from him, these are the things which defile the man.
041	MAR	007	016	If any one has ears to hear, let him hear.
041	MAR	007	017	And when He came from the multitude into the house, His disciples asked Him the parable.
041	MAR	007	018	And He says to them, Are you still without understanding? Do you not know that everything external entering into a man is not able to defile him?
041	MAR	007	019	Because it does not go into his heart, but into his stomach, and is cast out into the excrement, purifying all edibles.
041	MAR	007	020	And He said, Everything proceeding out from the man, that defiles the man.
041	MAR	007	021	For within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil reasonings, adulteries, fornications, murders,
041	MAR	007	022	thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, impurity, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, folly.
041	MAR	007	023	All these evils proceed out from within, and defile the man.
041	MAR	007	024	And rising up, He departed thence into the regions of Tyre and Sidon. And having entered into a house, and He wished no one to know it: and He was not able to be hidden.
041	MAR	007	025	For a woman hearing concerning Him, whose daughter had an unclean spirit, having come worshiped at His feet.
041	MAR	007	026	For the woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by race; and asked Him that He may cast the demon out of her daughter.
041	MAR	007	027	And He said to her, Permit the children first to be fed: for It is not good to take the children's bread and cast it to little dogs.
041	MAR	007	028	And she responded and says to Him, Yea, Lord: for even the little dogs eat the crumbs of the children under the table.
041	MAR	007	029	And He said to her, On account of this word go; the demon has already gone out from thy daughter.
041	MAR	007	030	And having come into her house, she found the demon gone out, and the daughter lying on the bed.
041	MAR	007	031	And having again come out from Tyre and Sidon, He came to the Sea of Galilee, amid the coasts of Decapolis.
041	MAR	007	032	And they bring Him a deaf man, speaking with difficulty; and intreat Him that He may lay His hand on him.
041	MAR	007	033	And taking him from the crowd privately, He put His fingers in his ears, and having spat, He touched his tongue;
041	MAR	007	034	and looking up to heaven, he groaned, and says to him, Ephphatha, which is, Be thou opened.
041	MAR	007	035	And immediately his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue loosed, and he continued to speak distinctly.
041	MAR	007	036	And He charged them that they should tell no one: and the more He charged them, the more abundantly they proclaimed it.
041	MAR	007	037	And were astonished exceedingly, saying, He has done all things well: He makes the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.
041	MAR	008	001	In those days, the multitude being large, and having nothing which they may eat, Jesus calling His disciples, says to them,
041	MAR	008	002	I sympathize with the multitude because three days already abide unto me, and they have nothing which they may eat.
041	MAR	008	003	If I shall send them away to their homes fasting, they will faint on the road; indeed some of them have come from afar.
041	MAR	008	004	And His disciples responded, Whence shall any one be able to feed these with bread in the desert?
041	MAR	008	005	And He asked them, How much bread have you? And they said, Seven loaves.
041	MAR	008	006	He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground; and taking the seven loaves, giving thanks, He broke, and gave them to His disciples, that they may dispense them; and they presented them to the multitude.
041	MAR	008	007	And they had a few fishes: and blessing them, He delivered them.
041	MAR	008	008	And they ate, and were filled: and they took up the residue of the fragments, seven baskets.
041	MAR	008	009	And those eating were about four thousand. And He sent them away.
041	MAR	008	010	And immediately having gone into the ship with His disciples, He came to the parts of Dalmanutha.
041	MAR	008	011	And the Pharisees came out, and began to question Him, seeking from Him a sign from heaven. tempting Him.
041	MAR	008	012	And groaning in spirit, He says, What sign does this generation seek after? truly I say unto you, No sign shall be given unto this generation.
041	MAR	008	013	And having left them, coming in again He departed to the other side.
041	MAR	008	014	And they forgot to take bread; and had but one loaf with them in the ship.
041	MAR	008	015	And He commanded them, saying, See, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.
041	MAR	008	016	And they were reasoning to one another, saying, It is because we have not bread.
041	MAR	008	017	And Jesus knowing says to them, Why do you reason because you have not bread? do you not yet know, nor understand? have you your heart still hardened?
041	MAR	008	018	Having eyes, do you not see? having ears, do you not hear? and do you not remember?
041	MAR	008	019	When I broke the five loaves to the five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments did you take up? They say to Him, Twelve.
041	MAR	008	020	And when the seven loaves to the four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments did you take up? And they said, Seven.
041	MAR	008	021	And He said to them, Do you not yet understand?
041	MAR	008	022	And they come into Bethsaida: and they bring Him a blind man, and they intreat Him that He may touch him.
041	MAR	008	023	And taking the blind man by the hand, He led him out of the village; and spitting in his eyes, putting His hands on him, He asked him, if he sees anything.
041	MAR	008	024	And looking up he said, I see the men walking about like trees.
041	MAR	008	025	Then again He put His hands on his eyes, and he looked up; and was restored, and saw all things distinctly.
041	MAR	008	026	And He sent him to his own house, saying, Go not into the village.
041	MAR	008	027	And Jesus and His disciples went away into the villages of Caesarea Philippi; and on the way He asked His disciples, saying to them, Whom do the people say that I am?
041	MAR	008	028	And they answered Him saying, John the Baptist: and others, Elijah; and others, One of the prophets.
041	MAR	008	029	And He asked them, Whom do you say that I am? And Peter responding says to Him, Thou art the Christ.
041	MAR	008	030	And He charged them that they should speak to no one concerning Him.
041	MAR	008	031	And He began to teach them, that it behooves the Son of man to suffer many things, and to be rejected by the elders, and the chief priests and the scribes, and to be killed, and after three days to rise.
041	MAR	008	032	And He was boldly speaking the word. And Peter taking Him to him began to rebuke Him.
041	MAR	008	033	And He turning and seeing His disciples rebuked Peter, and says, Get behind me, adversary: because thou art not thinking the things of God, but those of men.
041	MAR	008	034	And calling the multitude to Him with His disciples, He said to them, Whosoever wishes to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
041	MAR	008	035	For whosoever may wish to save his soul shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his soul for my sake and that of the gospel shall save it.
041	MAR	008	036	For what shall it profit a man to gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?
041	MAR	008	037	For what would a man give in exchange for his soul?
041	MAR	008	038	For whosoever may be ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and wicked generation, the Son of man shall also be ashamed of him, when He may come in the glory of His Father with the holy angels.
041	MAR	009	001	And He said to them, Truly I say unto you, that there are certain ones of those standing here, who may not taste of death, until they may see the kingdom of God, having come with power.
041	MAR	009	002	After six days Jesus takes Peter, and John, and James, and carries them up into an exceedingly high mountain privately alone; and was transfigured before them:
041	MAR	009	003	and His raiment became resplendent, exceedingly white like snow; as no fuller on earth is able to whiten.
041	MAR	009	004	And Elijah was seen by them with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus.
041	MAR	009	005	And Peter responding says to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah:
041	MAR	009	006	for he did not know what he might say; for they were afraid.
041	MAR	009	007	And there was a cloud overshadowing them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear ye Him.
041	MAR	009	008	And immediately looking around, they saw no one, but Jesus only with them.
041	MAR	009	009	And they coming down from the mountain, He charged them, that they should relate to no one the things which they saw, until the Son of man may rise from the dead.
041	MAR	009	010	And they held the word to themselves, inquiring, what it is to rise from the dead.
041	MAR	009	011	And they asked Him, saying, that the scribes say, that it behooves Elijah first to come.
041	MAR	009	012	He responding said to them, Elijah indeed having first come, restores all things: and how has it been written in reference to the Son of man, that he should suffer many things, and be set at naught?
041	MAR	009	013	But I say unto you, that Elijah indeed has come, and they did unto him so many things as they wished, as has been written in reference to him.
041	MAR	009	014	And having come to the disciples, He saw a great multitude around them and the scribes disputing with them!
041	MAR	009	015	And immediately the whole multitude, seeing Him, became excited, and running to Him, seized Him; and He asked the scribes,
041	MAR	009	016	Why are you disputing with them?
041	MAR	009	017	And one responding from the multitude, said, Teacher, I have brought my son to thee, having a dumb spirit.
041	MAR	009	018	And when he may take him, he lacerates him: and he froths, and gnashes his teeth, and pines away. And I said to thy disciples, that they should cast him out; and they were not able.
041	MAR	009	019	And He responding to them, says, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you? Bring him hither to me.
041	MAR	009	020	And they brought him to Him; and seeing Him, immediately the spirit convulsed him; and falling on the ground, he continued to wallow, foaming.
041	MAR	009	021	And He asked his father, How long is it since this occurred to him? And he said, from childhood:
041	MAR	009	022	and frequently he cast him into the fire and into the waters, in order that he may destroy him: but if you are able to do anything, assist us, being moved with compassion towards us.
041	MAR	009	023	And Jesus said to him, It is this, if you are able (to believe); all things are possible to him that believeth.
041	MAR	009	024	And immediately the father of the child crying out with tears, continued to say, I believe; assist thou my unbelief.
041	MAR	009	025	And Jesus seeing that the multitude are running together, rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him, Dumb and deaf spirit, I command thee, come out from him, and enter no more into him.
041	MAR	009	026	And crying out, and convulsing he came out. And he became like a corpse; so that many said, that, he is dead.
041	MAR	009	027	And Jesus, taking him by the hand, lifted him up; and he stood up.
041	MAR	009	028	And His disciples asked I Iim privately, having come into the house, Why were we not able to cast him out?
041	MAR	009	029	And He said unto them, This kind is able to come out by nothing, but by prayer.
041	MAR	009	030	And they coming out thence, traveled through Galilee; and He was not willing that any one should know it.
041	MAR	009	031	For He was teaching His disciples, and saying to them, The Son of man is betrayed into the hands of men, and they will kill Him; and having been killed, He will rise again the third day.
041	MAR	009	032	And they did not understand the word, and they were afraid to ask Him.
041	MAR	009	033	And He came into Capernaum. And He being in the house asked them, What were you disputing about to one another in the way?
041	MAR	009	034	And they were silent: for they were disputing to one another in the way, who was the greater.
041	MAR	009	035	And sitting down, He called the twelve; and says to them, If any one wishes to be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all.
041	MAR	009	036	And taking a little child, He placed it in their midst; and taking it up in His arms, He said to them,
041	MAR	009	037	Whosoever may receive one of such little children in my name, receives me: and whosoever may receive me, receives not me, but Him that sent me.
041	MAR	009	038	And John responded to Him saying, Teacher, we saw one casting out demons in Thy name, who does not follow us; and we forbade him, because he does not follow us.
041	MAR	009	039	And Jesus said, Forbid him not. For there is no one who shall do a miracle in my name, and be able quickly to speak evil of me.
041	MAR	009	040	For whosoever is not against us, is on our side.
041	MAR	009	041	For whosoever may give you a cup of water in my name, because you are Christ's, truly I say unto you, can not lose his reward.
041	MAR	009	042	Whosoever may offend one of these little ones who believe in me, rather is it good for him, if a millstone is hung about his neck, and he may be cast into the sea.
041	MAR	009	043	And if thy hand may offend thee, cut it off: it is good for thee to go into life maimed, rather than having two hands to go away into hell, into the fire that can not be quenched.
041	MAR	009	045	If thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is good for thee to go into life lame, rather than have two feet to be cast into hell.
041	MAR	009	047	If thine eye may offend thee, cast it from thee: it is good for thee entering into the kingdom of God having one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell;
041	MAR	009	048	where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.
041	MAR	009	049	For every one shall be salted with fire.
041	MAR	009	050	Salt is good: but if the salt may become savorless, with what will you salt it? Have salt in yourselves, and live in peace with one another.
041	MAR	010	001	Rising up thence He comes into the coasts of Judea, through the region beyond the Jordan; and the multitudes again come to Him, and, as was His custom, He again taught them.
041	MAR	010	002	And the Pharisees having come forward asked Him, If it is lawful for a man to send away his wife? tempting Him.
041	MAR	010	003	And He responding said to them, What did Moses command you?
041	MAR	010	004	And they said, Moses permitted to write a book of divorcement, and to send her away.
041	MAR	010	005	Jesus said to them, On account of the hardness of your heart he wrote this commandment to you.
041	MAR	010	006	But from the beginning of creation God made them male and female.
041	MAR	010	007	On this account a man shall leave his father and his mother,
041	MAR	010	008	and they two shall be one flesh; so they are no longer two, but one flesh.
041	MAR	010	009	And what God joined together, let no man separate.
041	MAR	010	010	And His disciples again around Him in the house asked Him. And He says to them,
041	MAR	010	011	Whosoever may send away his wife, and marry another, commits adultery unto her.
041	MAR	010	012	And if she having sent away her husband, may marry another, she commits adultery.
041	MAR	010	013	And they continued to bring little children to Him, that He should touch them: but the disciples rebuked those bringing them.
041	MAR	010	014	But Jesus seeing was displeased, and said to them, Suffer the little children to come unto me; and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.
041	MAR	010	015	Truly, I say unto you, Whosoever may not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, can not enter into it.
041	MAR	010	016	And taking them up in His arms, putting His hands on them, He continued to bless them copiously.
041	MAR	010	017	And He traveling along the road, one having run to Him and worshiping Him, asked Him, Good Teacher, what shall I do in order that I may inherit eternal life?
041	MAR	010	018	And Jesus said to him, Why do you call me good? No one is good but One, God.
041	MAR	010	019	You know the commandments, thou must not commit adultery, thou must not murder, thou must not steal, thou must not bear false witness, thou must not defraud, honor thy father and mother.
041	MAR	010	020	And he said to Him, Teacher, I have kept all these from my youth.
041	MAR	010	021	Jesus looking on him loved him, and said to him, One thing is wanting to thee: go, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.
041	MAR	010	022	And he being grieved at the word, went away sorrowing: for he had great possessions.
041	MAR	010	023	And Jesus looking around, says to His disciples; How hardly shall those having riches enter into the kingdom of God!
041	MAR	010	024	And the disciples were astonished at His words, and Jesus again responding, says to them, Children, how difficult it is to enter into the kingdom of God!
041	MAR	010	025	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to go into the kingdom of God.
041	MAR	010	026	And they were astonished exceedingly, saying to one another, And who is able to be saved?
041	MAR	010	027	And Jesus looking upon them says, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for all things are possible with God.
041	MAR	010	028	Peter began to say to Him, Behold, we have left all things, and followed thee.
041	MAR	010	029	Jesus said, Truly I say unto you, there is no one who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or lands, on account of me and the gospel,
041	MAR	010	030	except he may receive a hundredfold now in this time, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the coming age eternal life.
041	MAR	010	031	But many who are first shall be last; and the last first.
041	MAR	010	032	And they were in the way, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was going before them: and they were amazed; and following they were afraid. And taking the twelve to Himself, again He began to tell them the things which were about to happen to Him;
041	MAR	010	033	Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed to the chief priests and scribes; and they will condemn Him to death, and they will deliver Him to the Gentiles:
041	MAR	010	034	and they will mock Him, and will scourge Him, and will spit upon Him, and will kill Him; and He will rise the third day.
041	MAR	010	035	James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come to Him, saying, Teacher, we wish that you may do unto us whatsoever we may ask.
041	MAR	010	036	And He said to them, What do you wish for me to do for you?
041	MAR	010	037	And they said to Him, Grant unto us, that we may sit, one on thy right, and one on thy left, in thy glory.
041	MAR	010	038	And Jesus said to them, You know not what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup which I drink? and to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?
041	MAR	010	039	And they said to Him, We are able. And Jesus said to them, You shall indeed drink the cup which I drink, and be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized:
041	MAR	010	040	but to sit on my right, and on my left, is not mine to give, but is for those for whom it has been prepared.
041	MAR	010	041	And the ten hearing, began to be indignant concerning James and John.
041	MAR	010	042	And Jesus calling them to Him, says to them: You know that those seeming competent to rule the Gentiles domineer over them; and their great ones exercise authority over them.
041	MAR	010	043	But it is not so among you: but whosoever may wish to be great among you, shall be your servant:
041	MAR	010	044	and whosoever of you may wish to be first, shall be the slave of all:
041	MAR	010	045	for the Son of man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give His soul a ransom for many.
041	MAR	010	046	And they come into Jericho: and He and His disciples and a great multitude going out from Jericho, blind Bartimeus, the son of Timeus, was sitting by the wayside, begging.
041	MAR	010	047	And hearing that it is Jesus the Nazarene, began to cry out, and say, Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me.
041	MAR	010	048	And many continued to rebuke him that he should keep silent: but he continued to cry out much more, O son of David, have mercy on me.
041	MAR	010	049	And Jesus standing, said, that he should be called. And they call the blind man, saying to him, Take courage: rise up, He calls you.
041	MAR	010	050	And he, casting away his cloak, rising, came to Jesus.
041	MAR	010	051	And Jesus responding said to him, What do you wish that I shall do to you? And the blind man said to Him, Great Master, that I may look up.
041	MAR	010	052	And Jesus said to him, Go; thy faith hath saved thee: and immediately he looked up, and followed Jesus in the way.
041	MAR	011	001	And when they draw nigh to Jerusalem and to Bethany, to the Mount of Olives, He sends away two of His disciples,
041	MAR	011	002	and says to them, Go into the village over against you: and immediately entering into it, you will find a colt tied, on which no one of men has ever sat; loosing him, lead him away.
041	MAR	011	003	And if any one may say to you, Why do you this? say to him, that the Lord hath need of him; and immediately he sends him hither.
041	MAR	011	004	Then they departed, and found the colt tied at the door without at the crossing of the road; and they are loosing him.
041	MAR	011	005	And certain ones of those standing there said to them, What are you doing, loosing the colt?
041	MAR	011	006	And they said to them as Jesus commanded: and they permitted them.
041	MAR	011	007	And they lead the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and He sat on him.
041	MAR	011	008	And many strewed their garments in the road; and others were cutting down the branches of the trees, (and strewing them in the road),
041	MAR	011	009	And those going before, and those following after, continued to cry out, Hosanna: blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord:
041	MAR	011	010	blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David: Hosanna in the highest!
041	MAR	011	011	And He came into Jerusalem, into the temple; and looking round upon all things, the hour being already late, He went out into Bethany along with the twelve.
041	MAR	011	012	And on the morrow, they going out from Bethany, He was hungry.
041	MAR	011	013	And seeing a fig-tree at a distance, having leaves, He came, if perchance He shall find something on it: and having come to it, He found nothing except leaves; for it was not the time of the figs.
041	MAR	011	014	And responding He said to it, Let no one ever eat fruit from thee. And His disciples heard Him.
041	MAR	011	015	And they come into Jerusalem: and He having come into the temple, began to cast out the buyers and sellers in the temple, and He overturned the tables of the money-exchangers, and the seats of those selling doves;
041	MAR	011	016	and He did not suffer that any one should carry a vessel through the temple.
041	MAR	011	017	And He was teaching, saying to them, Is it not written, That my house shall be called a house of prayer for all the Gentiles? But you have made it a den of thieves.
041	MAR	011	018	And the scribes and high priests heard Him, seeking how they might destroy Him: for they feared Him, because all the multitude were delighted with His teaching.
041	MAR	011	019	And when it was evening, He departed out of the city.
041	MAR	011	020	And going along in the morning, they saw the fig-tree utterly withered from the roots.
041	MAR	011	021	And Peter remembering says to Him, Master, behold, the fig-tree which thou didst execrate is withered away.
041	MAR	011	022	And Jesus responding says to them, Have God's faith.
041	MAR	011	023	Truly I say unto you, That whosoever may say to this mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea; and may not doubt in his heart, but believe that what he says does take place; it shall be unto him.
041	MAR	011	024	Therefore I say unto you, All things whatsoever you pray for and ask, believe that you just now received them, and they shall be unto you.
041	MAR	011	025	And when you stand praying, forgive, if you have aught against any one; in order that your Father who is in the heavens may forgive you your trespasses.
041	MAR	011	027	They come again into Jerusalem. And He walking round in the temple, the high priests, and scribes, and elders come to Him;
041	MAR	011	028	and they said to Him, By what authority are you doing these things? and who gave you this authority that you may do them?
041	MAR	011	029	And Jesus said to them, I will ask you one word, and you respond to me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things:
041	MAR	011	030	Was the baptism of John from heaven, or from men? answer me.
041	MAR	011	031	And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we may say, It is from heaven; He will say, Why did you not believe on him?
041	MAR	011	032	But if we may say, From men; they feared the people: for all held John that he was a prophet.
041	MAR	011	033	And responding they say to Jesus, We do not know. And Jesus says to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.
041	MAR	012	001	And He began to speak to them in parables. A man planted a vineyard, and placed a hedge round it, and dug a wine-trough; and built a tower, and he gave it out to husbandmen, and went away.
041	MAR	012	002	And he sent a servant to the husbandmen in the season, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard:
041	MAR	012	003	and they taking him, beat him, and sent him away empty.
041	MAR	012	004	And again he sent to them another servant; and stoning him they wounded him in the head, and sent him away dishonored.
041	MAR	012	005	And again he sent another; and they slew him, and many others beating some, killing others.
041	MAR	012	006	Then having still one son, his own beloved, he sent him also to them last, saying; That they will reverence my son.
041	MAR	012	007	And those husbandmen said to one another; This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.
041	MAR	012	008	And taking him they slew him, and cast him out of the vineyard.
041	MAR	012	009	What then shall the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the husbandmen, and give the vineyard to others.
041	MAR	012	010	Have you not read the Scripture; The stone which the builders rejected, the same has come to be the head of the corner:
041	MAR	012	011	this was with the Lord, and is wonderful in our eyes?
041	MAR	012	012	And they were seeking to arrest Him; and they feared the multitude; for they knew that He spoke the parable against them. And leaving Him they went away.
041	MAR	012	013	And they send to Him certain ones of the Pharisees and Herodians, that they may catch Him with speech.
041	MAR	012	014	And they having come, say to Him, Teacher, we know that thou art true, and there is not a care to thee for any one: for thou dost not look into the face of men, but thou dost teach the way of God in truth: is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not? must we give, or must we not give?
041	MAR	012	015	And knowing their hypocrisy, He said to them, Why tempt ye me? Bring to me the denarion, that I may see it.
041	MAR	012	016	And they brought it. And He says to them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they say to Him, Caesar's.
041	MAR	012	017	And Jesus responding said to them, Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things which are God's. And they were astonished at Him.
041	MAR	012	018	And the Sadducees come to Him, who say there is no resurrection; and asked Him, saying;
041	MAR	012	019	Teacher, Moses wrote to us, That if the brother of any man may die, and leave a wife and have no children, that his brother must take his wife and raise up seed to his brother.
041	MAR	012	020	There were seven brothers, and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.
041	MAR	012	021	And the second received her and died, and he left no seed; and the third likewise.
041	MAR	012	022	And the seven received her and left no seed. Last of all the woman also died.
041	MAR	012	023	Then in the resurrection, when they may rise, of which one of them shall she be the wife? for the seven had her a wife.
041	MAR	012	024	And Jesus responding, said to them; Therefore do you not err, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God?
041	MAR	012	025	For when they may rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage; but they are as angels in the heavens.
041	MAR	012	026	But concerning the dead, that they are raised, have you not read in the book of Moses at the Bush, how God spoke to him saying; I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?
041	MAR	012	027	He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You do err much.
041	MAR	012	028	And a certain one of the scribes, hearing them propounding questions, knowing that He answered them beautifully, asked Him, What is the first commandment of all?
041	MAR	012	029	And Jesus responded to him, The first commandment of all; Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God, is one Lord:
041	MAR	012	030	and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength. This is the first commandment.
041	MAR	012	031	And the second is like unto it; Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. There is no other commandment greater than these.
041	MAR	012	032	And the scribes said to Him, Truly, Teacher; thou hast spoken in truth that He is One; and there is no other besides Him.
041	MAR	012	033	And love Him with all the heart, and with all the mind, and with all the strength, and to love thy neighbor as thyself is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.
041	MAR	012	034	And Jesus seeing that he answered intelligently, said to him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no one dared to ask Him any more,
041	MAR	012	035	And Jesus responding spoke, teaching in the temple, How do the scribes say that Christ is the son of David?
041	MAR	012	036	For David himself said in the Holy Spirit, the Lord said unto my Lord; Sit thou on my right hand, until I may make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet!
041	MAR	012	037	Then David himself calls Him Lord; and whence is He his son? And the great multitude were hearing Him delightfully.
041	MAR	012	038	And He said to them in His teaching, Beware of the scribes, wishing to walk about in robes, and salutations in the forums,
041	MAR	012	039	and the first seats in the synagogues, and the first couches at the suppers.
041	MAR	012	040	They are those devouring the houses of widows, and making long prayers through pretext; they shall receive the greater judgment.
041	MAR	012	041	And He sitting in front of the treasury, was seeing how the multitudes are casting their money into the treasury. And many rich people were casting in much.
041	MAR	012	042	And one poor widow was casting in two mites, which is a farthing.
041	MAR	012	043	And calling His disciples to Him, He says to them, Truly I say unto you, That this poor widow has cast in more than all those casting into the treasury.
041	MAR	012	044	For all they of that which abounds unto them cast in; but she of her scarcity cast in all things so many as she had, all her living.
041	MAR	013	001	And He departing out from the temple, one of His disciples says to Him, Teacher, behold, how great stones and how great buildings!
041	MAR	013	002	And Jesus responding said to him, Do you see these great buildings? stone may not be left upon stone, which may not be thrown down.
041	MAR	013	003	And He sitting upon the Mount of Olives in front of the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked Him privately,
041	MAR	013	004	Tell us, when these things shall be? and what shall be the sign when all these things may be about to have an end?
041	MAR	013	005	And Jesus began to say to them, See, lest any one may deceive you.
041	MAR	013	006	For many will come in my name, saying, I am He; and will deceive many. I
041	MAR	013	007	And when you may hear of wars and rumors of wars, be not disturbed: for it behooves it to be so; but the end is not yet.
041	MAR	013	008	For nation will rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earth-quakes in divers places; and there shall be famines.
041	MAR	013	009	These are the beginnings of travails. But you take heed to yourselves: for they will deliver you into councils; and will beat you in the synagogues: and you shall stand before governors and kings on account of me, for a testimony unto them.
041	MAR	013	010	And it behooves the gospel first to be preached to all the nations.
041	MAR	013	011	And when they may lead you forth, delivering you up, do not be solicitous what you may speak, nor meditate: but whatsoever may be given to you in that hour, speak this: for you are not those speaking, but the Holy Spirit.
041	MAR	013	012	And brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father the child; and the children will rise up against the parents, and put them to death.
041	MAR	013	013	And you shall be hated by all on account of my name: but the one persevering to the end, the same shall be saved.
041	MAR	013	014	And when you may see the abomination of desolation standing where it ought not (let him that readeth know), then let those in Judea fly to the mountains:
041	MAR	013	015	and let not the one on the housetop come down, nor enter in, to take anything out of his house:
041	MAR	013	016	and let not the one who is in the field turn back to take his garment.
041	MAR	013	017	But alas unto those who are in gestation and nursing in those days.
041	MAR	013	018	But pray that your flight may not be in the winter.
041	MAR	013	019	For these days will be tribulation, such as has never been from the beginning of creation which God created, until now, and never may be.
041	MAR	013	020	And unless the Lord shortened those days, no flesh would be saved: but for the sake of the elect, whom He chose, He shortened the days.
041	MAR	013	021	And if then one may say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or, Lo, there; believe not.
041	MAR	013	022	For false Christs and false prophets will arise, and give signs and wonders, to deceive even the elect, if possible.
041	MAR	013	023	But you see: behold, I have foretold you all things.
041	MAR	013	024	And in those days, after that desolation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give her light,
041	MAR	013	025	and the stars of heaven will be falling, and the powers which are in the heavens shall be shaken.
041	MAR	013	026	And then they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.
041	MAR	013	027	And then He will send forth His angels, and will gather His elect from the four winds, from the extremity of the earth unto the extremity of heaven.
041	MAR	013	028	But learn the parable from the fig-tree: when her branches may be now tender, and she may grow out leaves, know that the summer is nigh.
041	MAR	013	029	So you also, when you may see these things take place, know that it is already at the doors.
041	MAR	013	030	Truly I say unto you, this race may not pass away, until all these things may be fulfilled.
041	MAR	013	031	Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.
041	MAR	013	032	But concerning that day or hour no one knows, neither the angels who are in heaven, or the Son, but the Father.
041	MAR	013	033	Beware, watch; for you know not when the time is.
041	MAR	013	034	As a man, going away, leaving his own house, and giving authority to his servants, and to each one his work, and commanded the porter that he should watch.
041	MAR	013	035	Watch therefore: for you know not when the Lord of the house cometh, late, or at midnight, or at the crowing of the cock, or in the morning;
041	MAR	013	036	lest having come suddenly he may find you sleeping.
041	MAR	013	037	And the things I say to you, I say to all, Watch.
041	MAR	014	001	And it was the passover and feast of unleavened bread after two days. And the high priests and scribes were seeking how they might kill Him, having taken Him by stratagem.
041	MAR	014	002	For they said, Not at the feast, lest there shall be an uproar of the people.
041	MAR	014	003	And He being in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, He sitting at the table, a woman came having an alabaster box of myrrh of spikenard estimated very valuable; and breaking the alabastar box, she poured it on His head.
041	MAR	014	004	And there were certain ones indulging in indignation among themselves (and saying), For what was this loss of the myrrh?
041	MAR	014	005	For this myrrh was able to be sold for more than three hundred denaria, and given to the poor. And they murmured against her.
041	MAR	014	006	And Jesus said, Let her alone; why do you give her trouble? she hath wrought a beautiful work in me.
041	MAR	014	007	For you have the poor always with you, and when you wish, you are able to do them good: but you have not me always.
041	MAR	014	008	She did what she could: she came aforehand to anoint my body for the burial.
041	MAR	014	009	Truly I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel may be preached in all the world, that which she did shall indeed be spoken of for a memorial of her.
041	MAR	014	010	And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, that he might betray Him to them.
041	MAR	014	011	And they, hearing, rejoiced, and promised to give him money. And he was seeking how he might betray Him opportunely.
041	MAR	014	012	And on the first day of the unleavened bread, when they were accustomed to slay the passover, His disciples say to Him; Where do you wish, that we, having gone away may prepare that you may eat the passover?
041	MAR	014	013	And He sends away two of His disciples, and says to them; Go into the city and a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water; follow him,
041	MAR	014	014	whithersoever he may go in, say to the landlord that the Teacher says, Where is my guest chamber where I may eat the passover with my disciples?
041	MAR	014	015	And he will show you a large upper room furnished, ready; there prepare for us.
041	MAR	014	016	And His disciples went out, and came into the city, and found as He said to them, and prepared the passover.
041	MAR	014	017	And it being evening, He comes with the twelve.
041	MAR	014	018	And they sitting and eating, Jesus said, Truly, I say unto you, that, One of you who eateth with me shall betray me.
041	MAR	014	019	And they began to be grieved, and to say to Him one by one, Whether am I the one? And another, Whether am I the one?
041	MAR	014	020	And He said to them, One of the twelve who is dipping with me in the dish.
041	MAR	014	021	Truly the Son of man goes, as has been written concerning Him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It was good for him if that man had never been born.
041	MAR	014	022	And they eating, Jesus having taken the bread, blessing it, broke, and gave it to them, and said, Take it: this is my body.
041	MAR	014	023	And taking the cup, blessing it, He gave it to them, and all drank of it.
041	MAR	014	024	And He said to them, This is my blood, which belongs to the new covenant, which is poured out for many.
041	MAR	014	025	Truly I say unto you, That I shall no more drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I may drink it new in the kingdom of God.
041	MAR	014	026	And they having sung a hymn, went out into the Mount of Olives.
041	MAR	014	027	And Jesus says to them, You will all be offended, because it has been written, I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.
041	MAR	014	028	But after I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.
041	MAR	014	029	And Peter said to Him, If indeed, all shall be offended, yet not I.
041	MAR	014	030	And Jesus says to him, Truly I say unto thee, That thou to-day, even this night, before the cock shall crow twice, shalt deny me thrice.
041	MAR	014	031	And he continued to say the more positively, If it may behoove me to die with thee, I can never deny thee. And all continued to say likewise.
041	MAR	014	032	And they come into the place whose name is Gethsemane. And He says to His disciples, Sit here, until I may pray.
041	MAR	014	033	And He takes Peter, and John, and James with Him, and began to grieve and to be dejected.
041	MAR	014	034	And He says to them, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful unto death: abide here, and watch.
041	MAR	014	035	And having gone forward a little, He fell on the ground; and continued to pray, that if possible, the hour may pass from Him.
041	MAR	014	036	And He said, Father, Father, all things are possible to thee; take this cup from me; but not what I will, but what thou wilt.
041	MAR	014	037	And He comes, and finds them sleeping, and He says to Peter, Simon, do you sleep? Were you not able to watch one hour?
041	MAR	014	038	Watch and pray, that you may not enter into temptation: for the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
041	MAR	014	039	And again having gone away, He prayed, speaking the same word.
041	MAR	014	040	And turning, He found them again sleeping, for their eyes were heavy; and they did not know what they might respond to Him.
041	MAR	014	041	And He comes the third time, and says to them; Sleep on, and take your rest: it is over; the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners:
041	MAR	014	042	arise, let us go: behold, the one having betrayed me draws nigh.
041	MAR	014	043	And immediately, He still speaking, Judas Iscariot comes, being one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.
041	MAR	014	044	And the one having betrayed Him gave them a sign, saying, The one whom I shall kiss, is He: seize Him and lead Him away securely.
041	MAR	014	045	And having come, immediately advancing forward, he said to Him, Master, and kissed Him copiously.
041	MAR	014	046	And they laid their hands on Him and arrested Him.
041	MAR	014	047	And a certain one of those standing by drew his sword, and smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
041	MAR	014	048	Jesus responding said to them, You have come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to take me:
041	MAR	014	049	I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you did not arrest me: but in order that the Scriptures may be fulfilled.
041	MAR	014	050	And all leaving Him, fled away.
041	MAR	014	051	And one certain young man followed Him, invested with a linen cloth on his unclothed body: and they take hold of him.
041	MAR	014	052	And he leaving the linen cloth, fled from them in a state of nudity.
041	MAR	014	053	And they led Jesus to the high priest: and all the chief priests and elders and scribes came together to Him.
041	MAR	014	054	And Peter followed Him a long way off, even into the court of the high priest; and was sitting with the officers, and warming at the fire.
041	MAR	014	055	And the chief priests and all the sanhedrim were seeking testimony against Him to put Him to death; and they found none.
041	MAR	014	056	For many were testifying falsely against Him, and their testimonies were not equal.
041	MAR	014	057	And certain ones rising up, were testifying falsely against Him, saying,
041	MAR	014	058	We heard Him saying, I will destroy this temple made with hands, and will build another in three days, made without hands.
041	MAR	014	059	And thus their testimony was not equal.
041	MAR	014	060	And the high priest rising up in their midst, asked Jesus, saying, Do you respond nothing? what are they witnessing against you?
041	MAR	014	061	And He was silent, and answered nothing: again the high priest asked Him, and says to Him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?
041	MAR	014	062	And Jesus said, I am: and you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.
041	MAR	014	063	The high priest tearing his garments, says, Why have we yet need of witnesses?
041	MAR	014	064	You heard the blasphemy: what seems to you? And all answered, He is worthy of death.
041	MAR	014	065	And certain ones began to spit on Him, and to cover His face, and to buffet Him, and say to Him, Prophesy: and the officers received Him with blows.
041	MAR	014	066	And Peter being in the court, one of the maidservants of the high priest comes down;
041	MAR	014	067	and seeing Peter warming, looking upon him, says, Thou wast with Jesus the Nazarene.
041	MAR	014	068	And he denied, saying, I know not, neither do I understand what you say. And he went out into the portico; and the cock crew.
041	MAR	014	069	And the maidservant seeing him again, began to say to the bystanders, He is one of them.
041	MAR	014	070	And again he denied: and after a little again the bystanders were saying to Peter, Truly, thou art one of them; for indeed thou art a Galilean.
041	MAR	014	071	But he began to anathematize, and to swear, I know not this man of whom you speak.
041	MAR	014	072	And the cock crew the second time. And Peter remembered the word which Jesus told him; That, before the cock shall crow twice, thou wilt deny me thrice. And having gone out, he continued to weep.
041	MAR	015	001	And immediately early in the morning the high priests having made counsel with the elders and scribes, and all the sanhedrim, having bound Jesus, led Him away, and delivered Him to Pilate.
041	MAR	015	002	And Pilate asked Him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And responding He says to him, Thou sayest it.
041	MAR	015	003	And the chief priests were accusing Him of many things.
041	MAR	015	004	And Pilate again asked Him, saying, Do you not answer? behold, how many things they witness against you.
041	MAR	015	005	And Jesus responded nothing at all; so that Pilate marveled.
041	MAR	015	006	But during the feast he was accustomed to release unto them one prisoner, whom they asked,
041	MAR	015	007	And there was one called Barabbas, having been bound along with the insurrectionists, who had committed murder during the insurrection.
041	MAR	015	008	And the multitude crying out began to ask, as he was always accustomed to do unto them.
041	MAR	015	009	And Pilate responded to them, saying, Do you wish that I may release unto you the King of the Jews?
041	MAR	015	010	For he knew that the chief priests had delivered Him on account of envy.
041	MAR	015	011	And the chief priests persuaded the multitude that he should rather release unto them Barabbas.
041	MAR	015	012	And Pilate responding again said to them, Then what do you wish that I shall do unto Him whom you call the King of the Jews.
041	MAR	015	013	And they again cried out, Crucify Him.
041	MAR	015	014	And Pilate said to them, For what evil hath He done? And they cried out uproariously, Crucify Him.
041	MAR	015	015	And Pilate, wishing to do the multitude a favor, released unto them Barabbas. And having scourged Jesus, he delivered Him up that He should be crucified.
041	MAR	015	016	And the soldiers led Him into the court, which is the judgment hall; and call around Him the whole band.
041	MAR	015	017	And they put on Him a purple robe, and having plaited a thorny crown, put it on Him.
041	MAR	015	018	And they began to mock Him, Hail, King of the Jews!
041	MAR	015	019	And they continued to strike His head with a reed, and spit on Him, and putting down their knees worshiped Him.
041	MAR	015	020	And when they mocked Him, they divested Him of the purple robe, and put on Him His own raiment: and lead Him away in order that they may crucify Him.
041	MAR	015	021	And they compel a certain Simon, a Cyrenean, coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, that he must take His cross.
041	MAR	015	022	And they lead Him to Golgotha, a place which is interpreted, The place of a skull.
041	MAR	015	023	And they gave Him myrrhed wine to drink: and He did not take it.
041	MAR	015	024	And they crucify Him, and divide His garments, casting the lot upon them, what each one may take.
041	MAR	015	025	And it was the third hour, and they crucified Him.
041	MAR	015	026	And the superscription of His accusation was written over Him, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
041	MAR	015	027	And they crucify two thieves along with Him; the one on His right, and one on His left.
041	MAR	015	029	And passing by they continued to blaspheme Him, wagging their heads, and saying, Aha, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,
041	MAR	015	030	save thyself, and come down from the cross.
041	MAR	015	031	Likewise also the chief priests mocking to one another with the scribes, continued to say, He saved others; He is not able to save Himself.
041	MAR	015	032	Let Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, in order that we may see and believe. And those being crucified along with Him were reproaching Him.
041	MAR	015	033	And it being the sixth hour, there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.
041	MAR	015	034	And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
041	MAR	015	035	And certain ones of those standing by said, Behold, He is calling Elijah.
041	MAR	015	036	And one running and filling a sponge with vinegar, and reaching it forth on a reed, gave Him drink, saying, Let Him alone, let us see if Elijah comes to take Him down.
041	MAR	015	037	And Jesus, sending forth a loud voice, expired.
041	MAR	015	038	And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from top even to the bottom.
041	MAR	015	039	And the centurion standing by in front of Him, seeing that He thus expired, said; Surely this man was the Son of God.
041	MAR	015	040	And there were women looking on from a distance: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and Joses, and Salome;
041	MAR	015	041	who when He was in Galilee, were accustomed both to follow Him, and minister unto Him. And many other women who came up to Jerusalem along with Him.
041	MAR	015	042	And it already being evening, since it was the Preparation, which is the day before the Sabbath,
041	MAR	015	043	Joseph, who is from Arimathea, an honorable councilor, who also himself was waiting for the kingdom of God; having taken courage came to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.
041	MAR	015	044	And Pilate was astonished if He had died already. And having called the centurion, asked him if He was already dead.
041	MAR	015	045	And having learned from the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.
041	MAR	015	046	And having purchased linen, and taking Him down, he wrapped Him in the linen, and placed Him in a sepulcher which had been hewn out of the rock; and he rolled a stone to the door of the sepulcher.
041	MAR	015	047	And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses were looking where He is placed.
041	MAR	016	001	And the Sabbath passing away, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, prepared aromatics, in order that having come they may anoint Him.
041	MAR	016	002	And exceedingly early in the morning, the first of the Sabbaths, they come to the sepulcher, the sun approaching the horizon.
041	MAR	016	003	And they were saying to themselves, Who shall for us roll away the stone from the sepulcher?
041	MAR	016	004	And looking up, they see that the stone has already been rolled away: for it was exceedingly great.
041	MAR	016	005	And having come to the sepulcher, they saw a young man sitting on the right, clothed in a white robe. And they were affrighted.
041	MAR	016	006	But he says to them, Fear not: you are seeking Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been crucified: He is risen; He is not here: see the place where they laid Him.
041	MAR	016	007	But go, tell His disciples and Peter, that He goes before you into Galilee: you shall see Him there, as He told you.
041	MAR	016	008	And having come out from the sepulcher, they fled; and trembling and ecstasy possessed them, and they said nothing to any one; for they were afraid.

# BOOK	042	LUK	Luke	Luke
042	LUK	001	001	Inasmuch as many took it in hand to present a history concerning these things which have been fulfilled among us,
042	LUK	001	002	as those being eyewitnesses and ministers of the Word have delivered unto us;
042	LUK	001	003	it seemed good to me also, having followed carefully all things from the beginning, to write unto thee consecutively, O most noble Theophilus,
042	LUK	001	004	in order that thou mayest know the certainty of the words concerning which thou hast been instructed.
042	LUK	001	005	There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest, by name Zacharias, of the course of Ahijah, and his wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name Elizabeth.
042	LUK	001	006	And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord, blameless.
042	LUK	001	007	And there was no child to them, as Elizabeth was barren, and both were advanced in their days.
042	LUK	001	008	And it came to pass, while he was officiating in the order of his course before God,
042	LUK	001	009	(according to the custom of the priesthood he was chosen by lot to offer incense), having gone into the temple of the Lord;
042	LUK	001	010	and all the multitude of the people were praying without at the hour of incense;
042	LUK	001	011	the angel of the Lord appeared unto him standing on the right hand of the altar of incense:
042	LUK	001	012	and Zacharias was troubled seeing him, and fear fell on him.
042	LUK	001	013	And the angel said to him; Fear not, Zacharias; because thy prayer has been heard, and thy wife Elizabeth shall bring forth a son to thee, and thou shalt call his name John.
042	LUK	001	014	And there shall be joy and rejoicing, and many shall rejoice at his birth.
042	LUK	001	015	For he shall be great before the Lord; and he shall not drink wine and strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from the womb of his mother.
042	LUK	001	016	And he will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord, their God.
042	LUK	001	017	And he will go before Him in the spirit and Power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient unto the understanding of the righteous, to prepare a people made ready for the Lord.
042	LUK	001	018	And Zacharias said to the angel: According to what shall I know this? for I am old and my wife advanced in her days.
042	LUK	001	019	And the angel responding said to him; I am Gabriel standing in the presence of God, and am sent to speak to you and to preach to you these things.
042	LUK	001	020	And behold thou shalt be dumb and unable to speak, unto the day upon which these things may take place; because thou didst not believe my words, which shall be fulfilled in their time.
042	LUK	001	021	And the people were waiting for Zacharias, and were wondering because he tarries in the temple.
042	LUK	001	022	And having come out he was unable to speak to them; and they recognized that he had seen a vision in the temple; and he was beckoning to them and remained dumb.
042	LUK	001	023	And it came to pass when the days of his ministry were fulfilled, he went away to his own house.
042	LUK	001	024	And after these days Elizabeth, his wife, conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,
042	LUK	001	025	That the Lord so hath done unto me, in the days in which He condescended to take away my reproach among men.
042	LUK	001	026	And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, to which was the name
042	LUK	001	027	Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man, to whom was the name Joseph of the house of David; and the name of the virgin was Mary.
042	LUK	001	028	And the angel having come to her said; Hail, thou blessed one; the Lord is with thee; blessed art thou among women.
042	LUK	001	029	And she seeing was troubled over his word, and was reasoning what kind this salutation might be.
042	LUK	001	030	And the angel said to her; Fear not, Mary; for thou didst find favor with God.
042	LUK	001	031	And behold, thou shalt conceive and hear a son, and thou shalt call His name Jesus.
042	LUK	001	032	He shall be great and shall be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God shall give unto Him the throne of His father David:
042	LUK	001	033	and He shall reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His Kingdom there shall be no end.
042	LUK	001	034	And Mary said to the angel; How shall this be, since I know not man?
042	LUK	001	035	And the angel responding said to her; The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore, indeed, that holy thing that is begotten shall be called the Son of God.
042	LUK	001	036	And behold Elizabeth thy kinswoman, indeed, herself having conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month, to her who is called barren.
042	LUK	001	037	Because no word shall be impossible with God.
042	LUK	001	038	And Mary said; Behold the handmaiden of the Lord; may it be done unto me according to thy word. And the angel went away from her.
042	LUK	001	039	And Mary, rising, departed into the mountainous land, with haste, into a city of Judah.
042	LUK	001	040	And she came into the house of Zacharias and saluted Elizabeth.
042	LUK	001	041	And it came to pass when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the infant in her womb leaped; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit; and she spoke with a loud voice and said;
042	LUK	001	042	Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.
042	LUK	001	043	And whence is this to me that the mother of my Lord may come unto me?
042	LUK	001	044	For behold when the voice of your salutation came into my ears, the infant in my womb leaped with joy.
042	LUK	001	045	And blessed is she that believeth, because there shall be a perfection to those things having been spoken to her by the Lord.
042	LUK	001	046	And Mary said; My soul doth magnify the Lord,
042	LUK	001	047	and my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour,
042	LUK	001	048	because He looked upon the low state of his handmaiden.
042	LUK	001	049	For behold from now all generations call me blessed; because the Mighty One did great things unto me, and His name is holy;
042	LUK	001	050	and His mercy unto generation of generations to them that fear Him.
042	LUK	001	051	He wrought power by his own arm; he dispersed the proud in the thought of their heart.
042	LUK	001	052	He cast down the mighty from thrones and exalted the humble.
042	LUK	001	053	He filled the poor with good things, and sent away the rich empty.
042	LUK	001	054	He delivered his son Israel, to remember mercy,
042	LUK	001	055	as he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and his seed forever.
042	LUK	001	056	And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to her own house.
042	LUK	001	057	And the time of her parturition was fulfilled unto Elizabeth and she brought forth a son.
042	LUK	001	058	And the neighbors and her relatives heard, that the Lord was magnifying His mercy with her, and they continued to rejoice with her.
042	LUK	001	059	And it came to pass on the eighth day, they came to circumcise the little child; and they were calling him Zacharias, after the name of his father.
042	LUK	001	060	And his mother responding said; No, but he shall be called John.
042	LUK	001	061	And they said to her; That there is no one among thy kindred who is called by this name.
042	LUK	001	062	And they were beckoning to his father, what he might wish to call him.
042	LUK	001	063	And having asked for a writing tablet, he wrote saying; His name is John.
042	LUK	001	064	And all marveled. And his mouth immediately opened and his tongue loosed, and he continued to speak, praising God.
042	LUK	001	065	And fear came upon all of those dwelling around; and all these words were spoken abroad in all the mountainous regions of Judea.
042	LUK	001	066	And all those hearing placed them in their heart, saying; What then shall this little child be? And the hand of the Lord was with him.
042	LUK	001	067	And Zacharias his father was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied saying;
042	LUK	001	068	Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, because He looked upon us and wrought redemption to His people, and raised up unto us a horn of salvation
042	LUK	001	069	in the house of David His son.
042	LUK	001	070	As he spoke through the mouth of His holy prophets from the beginning;
042	LUK	001	071	salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all those who hate us,
042	LUK	001	072	to execute mercy with our fathers, and remember His holy covenant,
042	LUK	001	073	the oath which He swore to Abraham our father:
042	LUK	001	074	to grant unto us, having been delivered out of the hand of our enemies, to serve Him without fear,
042	LUK	001	075	in holiness and righteousness before Him all the days of our life.
042	LUK	001	076	And thou, little child, shall be called a prophet of the Highest; for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare His ways,
042	LUK	001	077	to give knowledge of salvation to His people in remission of their sins,
042	LUK	001	078	through the bowels of mercy of our God, in which the dayspring from on high looked upon us,
042	LUK	001	079	to appear unto those sitting in darkness and in the shadow of death, to direct our feet in the way of peace.
042	LUK	001	080	And the little child continued to grow and waxed strong in spirit; and was in the deserts until the day of his showing unto Israel.
042	LUK	002	001	It came to pass in those days, a decree went out from Augustus Caesar, to enroll all the world.
042	LUK	002	002	This was the first enrollment, Cyrenius being governor of Syria.
042	LUK	002	003	And all were going forth to enroll, each one into his own city.
042	LUK	002	004	And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city Nazareth, into Judea, into the city of David which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David,
042	LUK	002	005	to enroll himself along with Mary, the wife having been betrothed to him, being in an advanced state of pregnancy.
042	LUK	002	006	And it came to pass while they were there the days of her parturition were fulfilled.
042	LUK	002	007	And she brought forth her firstborn son, and she wrapped Him in swaddling clothes and laid Him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.
042	LUK	002	008	And the shepherds were in that country, tenting out and keeping guard over their flock by night.
042	LUK	002	009	And behold an angel of the Lord stood over them and the glory of the Lord shone around them; and they feared with great fear.
042	LUK	002	010	And the angel said to them; Fear not; for behold, I preach unto you the gospel of great joy, which shall be to all people;
042	LUK	002	011	because this day a Savior is born unto you, who is Christ the Lord, in the city of David.
042	LUK	002	012	And this shall be the sign unto you; you shall find an infant lying in a manger, wrapped in swaddling clothes.
042	LUK	002	013	And immediately a multitude of the heavenly host was with the angel, praising God and saying;
042	LUK	002	014	Glory to God in the highest, and peace on earth; good will among men.
042	LUK	002	015	And it came to pass, when the angels departed from them into heaven, indeed, the shepherds said to one another; Now let us go unto Bethlehem and see this word which has taken place, which the Lord made known to us.
042	LUK	002	016	They went making haste, and found both Mary and Joseph, and the infant lying in the manger.
042	LUK	002	017	And seeing, they made known concerning the word which was spoken to them about this little child.
042	LUK	002	018	And all hearing wondered concerning the things which were spoken to them by the shepherds.
042	LUK	002	019	And Mary kept all these words laying them up in her heart.
042	LUK	002	020	And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God, for all things which they heard and saw, as it was spoken to them.
042	LUK	002	021	And when the eight days of circumcising Him were fulfilled, and His name was called Jesus, having been called by the angel before He was conceived in the womb.
042	LUK	002	022	And when the days of their purification were fulfilled, according to the law of Moses, they carried him up into Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord,
042	LUK	002	023	as it was written in the law of the Lord; That every male opening the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;
042	LUK	002	024	and to offer a sacrifice according to that which has been written in the law of the Lord, a pair of turtle-doves, or two young pigeons.
042	LUK	002	025	And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; and the same man was righteous and godly, awaiting the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him;
042	LUK	002	026	and it was revealed unto him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death before he may see the Christ of the Lord.
042	LUK	002	027	And he came in the Spirit into the temple; and while the parents are bringing in the little child Jesus, that they may do according to the provisions of law concerning Him,
042	LUK	002	028	he received Him into his arms and blessed God and said;
042	LUK	002	029	Now, O Lord, thou art letting thy servant depart, in peace according to thy word;
042	LUK	002	030	because mine eyes saw thy salvation,
042	LUK	002	031	which thou didst prepare before the face of all peoples;
042	LUK	002	032	a light unto the revelation of the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.
042	LUK	002	033	And His father and His mother were marveling at the words spoken concerning Him.
042	LUK	002	034	And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, His mother; Behold, he is appointed unto the fall and rising of many in Israel, and unto a sign which is spoken against;
042	LUK	002	035	and a sword shall go through thy soul, in order that the reasonings of many hearts may be revealed.
042	LUK	002	036	And Anna was a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel of the tribe of Asher, herself being advanced in many days, having lived with her husband seven years from her virginity;
042	LUK	002	037	and she a widow of about fourscore years, who did not depart from the temple, worshiping night and day with fastings and prayers.
042	LUK	002	038	And she, at the same hour, standing up continued to praise the Lord, and speak concerning Him to all those awaiting the redemption in Jerusalem.
042	LUK	002	039	And when they finished all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee into their own city Nazareth.
042	LUK	002	040	And the child continued to grow and waxed strong in spirit, being full of wisdom; and the grace of God was on Him.
042	LUK	002	041	And His parents were going, according to custom, into Jerusalem at the feast of the passover.
042	LUK	002	042	And when He was twelve years old, they going up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast,
042	LUK	002	043	and having completed the days, while they were returning the boy Jesus remained in Jerusalem. And His parents knew it not.
042	LUK	002	044	And thinking that He is in the crowd, they came a day's journey, and were seeking Him among His relatives and acquaintances.
042	LUK	002	045	And not having found Him; they returned to Jerusalem seeking Him.
042	LUK	002	046	And it came to pass, after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing them and asking them questions.
042	LUK	002	047	And all hearing Him were astonished at His wisdom and answers.
042	LUK	002	048	And seeing Him they were astonished, and His mother said to Him; Child, why did you thus do unto us? Behold, thy father and I were seeking thee, sorrowful.
042	LUK	002	049	And He said to them, Why were you seeking after me? Did you not know that it behooved me to be in the affairs of my Father?
042	LUK	002	050	And they did not understand the word which He spoke unto them.
042	LUK	002	051	And He went down with them and came to Nazareth; and was subject unto them. And His mother continued to keep all these words in her heart.
042	LUK	002	052	And Jesus continued to grow in wisdom and stature and favor with God and men.
042	LUK	003	001	And in the fifteenth year in the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and Philip his brother, tetrarch of Ituria and the Trachonitis country, and Lusanius tetrarch of Abilene, during the high-priesthood of Annas
042	LUK	003	002	and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.
042	LUK	003	003	And he came into all the region round about the Jordan preaching the baptism of repentance unto the remissions of sins,
042	LUK	003	004	as has been written in the book of Isaiah the prophet, saying; The voice of one roaring in the wilderness; Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight His paths.
042	LUK	003	005	Every valley shall be filled up and every mountain and hill shall be cut down; and the crooked places shall be straight and the rough ways smooth.
042	LUK	003	006	And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.
042	LUK	003	007	Then he said unto the multitudes coming out to be baptized by him; O generations of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
042	LUK	003	008	Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to say among yourselves; We have Abraham our father.
042	LUK	003	009	But truly the ax is laid to the root of the trees; Therefore every tree not producing good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
042	LUK	003	010	And the multitudes asked him, saying; What then shall we do?
042	LUK	003	011	And responding he says to them, Let the one having two coats, give to him having none, and let the one having food do likewise.
042	LUK	003	012	And the publicans came also to be baptized, and said to him; Teacher, what shall we do!
042	LUK	003	013	And he said to them, Exact no more than that which has been appointed unto you.
042	LUK	003	014	And the soldiers were asking him saying; And what shall we do? And he said to them; Oppress no one, neither defraud; and be content with your wages.
042	LUK	003	015	And the people waiting and all reasoning in their hearts concerning John, lest he might be the Christ.
042	LUK	003	016	John responded to all, saying; I indeed baptize you with water; but there cometh One more powerful than I, the latchet of His sandals I am not worthy to loose; He will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and fire.
042	LUK	003	017	Whose fan is in His hand, and He will thoroughly purify His threshing-floor, and gather the wheat into His garner, and will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.
042	LUK	003	018	Then indeed exhorting them as to many other things he continued to preach the gospel to the people.
042	LUK	003	019	And Herod the tetrarch, being convicted by him concerning Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, and concerning the wickedness which Herod did,
042	LUK	003	020	added also this to all, and shut up John in prison.
042	LUK	003	021	And it came to pass while all the people were being baptized, and Jesus having been baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,
042	LUK	003	022	and the Holy Spirit in bodily appearance like a dove descended on Him; and there was a voice from heaven, saying; Thou art my beloved Son, I am delighted in Thee.
042	LUK	003	023	And Jesus was beginning to be about thirty years old, being as was supposed, the son of Joseph, the son of Eli,
042	LUK	003	024	Matthat, Levi, Melchi, Janna, Joseph:
042	LUK	003	025	Mattathios, Amos, Naum, Esli, Naggai,
042	LUK	003	026	Mattathios, Semei, Josech, Joda,
042	LUK	003	027	Joanna, Resa, Zorababbel, Salithiel, Neri,
042	LUK	003	028	Melchi, Addi, Cosam, Elmodam, Er,
042	LUK	003	029	Joses, Eliezer, Jorim, Matthat, Levi,
042	LUK	003	030	Simeon, Judah, Joseph, Jonan, Eliakim,
042	LUK	003	031	Melea, Mainan, Mattatha, Nathan, David,
042	LUK	003	032	Jesse, Obed, Booz, Salmon, Naasson,
042	LUK	003	033	Aminadab, Aram, Esrom, Phares, Judah,
042	LUK	003	034	Jacob, Isaac, Abraham, Thara, Nachor, Serouch, Ragau,
042	LUK	003	035	Phalek, Heber, Sala,
042	LUK	003	036	Cainan, Arphaxad, Shem, Noah, Lamech,
042	LUK	003	037	of Methusalah, Enoch, Jared, of Mahalaleel, Cainan,
042	LUK	003	038	of Enos, Seth, Adam, the Son of God.
042	LUK	004	001	And Jesus, full of the Holy Ghost, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, tempted by the devil forty days.
042	LUK	004	002	And He ate nothing during those days; and they having been completed, He afterward hungered.
042	LUK	004	003	And the devil said to Him, If thou art the Son of God, speak to this stone, in order that it may become bread.
042	LUK	004	004	And Jesus responded to him, saying; It has been written, That man shall not live upon bread alone, but upon every word of God.
042	LUK	004	005	And the devil leading Him up, he showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
042	LUK	004	006	And the devil said to Him, I will give all the authority and glories of these to thee: because it has been given unto me: and I give it to whom I may wish;
042	LUK	004	007	then if thou mayest worship before me all shall belong to thee.
042	LUK	004	008	And Jesus responding said to him; It has been written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and Him only shalt thou serve.
042	LUK	004	009	And he led Him into Jerusalem, and placed Him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said to Him, If thou art the Son of God cast thyself down from thence;
042	LUK	004	010	for it has been written, That He will give His angels charge concerning thee, in order to guard thee,
042	LUK	004	011	and they will bear thee upon their hands, lest at any time thou mayest dash thy foot against a stone.
042	LUK	004	012	And Jesus responding said to him; That it has been said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.
042	LUK	004	013	And the devil having perfected every temptation, departed from Him for a season.
042	LUK	004	014	And Jesus returned in the power of the spirit into Galilee. And the fame concerning Him went throughout the whole country.
042	LUK	004	015	And He was teaching in their synagogues, being glorified by all.
042	LUK	004	016	And He came into Nazareth, where He was brought up: and according to the custom to Him, He came into the synagogue on the Sabbath-day, and stood up to read.
042	LUK	004	017	And the Book of Isaiah the prophet was given to Him; and having opened the book, He found the place where it was written,
042	LUK	004	018	The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor: hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim deliverance to the captives, and sight to the blind, and to set at liberty them that are bruised,
042	LUK	004	019	to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.
042	LUK	004	020	And having closed the book, and giving it back to the officer, He sat down: and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on Him.
042	LUK	004	021	And He began to say to them; This day has this Scripture been fulfilled in your ears.
042	LUK	004	022	And they all continued to witness to Him, and wonder at the words of grace proceeding out from His mouth: and say, Is not this the son of Joseph?
042	LUK	004	023	And He said to them, You truly speak to me this parable, Physician, heal thyself: so many things as we heard having been done in Capernaum, do also here in thy own country.
042	LUK	004	024	And He said, Truly I say unto you, that no prophet is acceptable in his own country.
042	LUK	004	025	And in truth I say unto you, There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah. When the heaven was shut up three years and six months, how the famine was great over all the land;
042	LUK	004	026	and Elijah was sent to none of them, except to a widow woman in Sarepta of Sidon.
042	LUK	004	027	And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha; and none of them were cleansed except Naaman the Syrian.
042	LUK	004	028	And all in the synagogue, hearing these things, were filled with wrath.
042	LUK	004	029	And rising up, they cast Him out of the city, and were leading Him to the brink of the mountain on which their city was built, to hurl Him down;
042	LUK	004	030	and He having passed through the midst of them went away.
042	LUK	004	031	And He came down into Capernaum, a city of Galilee, And He was teaching them on the Sabbath.
042	LUK	004	032	And they were astonished at His teaching; because His word was with authority.
042	LUK	004	033	And in the synagogue there was a man having a spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried with a great voice,
042	LUK	004	034	saying, Let me alone; what is there to us and to thee, O Jesus the Nazarene? Hast thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.
042	LUK	004	035	Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be silent and come out from him; and the demon having thrown him down in the midst came out from him, not having injured him.
042	LUK	004	036	And fear came upon them all, and they were talking together to one another, saying, What word is this? because with authority and power He commands the unclean spirits, and they come out.
042	LUK	004	037	And the report concerning Him was going out into every place in the surrounding country,
042	LUK	004	038	Having arisen up from the synagogue, He came into the house of Simon. And the mother-in-law of Simon was afflicted with a great fever; and they asked Him concerning her.
042	LUK	004	039	And He, standing over her, rebuked the fever; and dismissed it; and immediately, having stood up, she continued to minister unto them.
042	LUK	004	040	And the sun having gone down, all so many as had people afflicted with various diseases continued to lead them to Him; and He having put His hands on each one of them, healed them.
042	LUK	004	041	And the demons continued to go out from many, crying, and saying, Thou art the Christ, the Son of God. And rebuking them, He did not suffer them to speak, because they knew that He was the Christ.
042	LUK	004	042	And it being day, having come out, He departed into a desert place: and the multitudes continued to seek Him; and they came unto Him, and they constrained Him not to depart from them.
042	LUK	004	043	And He said to them, That, it behooveth me to preach the gospel of the kingdom of God to many other cities: because unto this I have been sent.
042	LUK	004	044	And He was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.
042	LUK	005	001	And it came to pass, while the multitude is pressing on Him to hear the word of God, and He was standing by the lake of Gennesaret;
042	LUK	005	002	and He saw two ships standing by the lake: the fishermen, having gone from them, were washing their nets.
042	LUK	005	003	And having come into one of the ships, which belonged to Simon, He asked him to lead out a little from the land, and sitting down He was teaching the multitudes from the ship.
042	LUK	005	004	When He ceased speaking He said to Simon, Lead out into the deep, and spread your nets for a draught.
042	LUK	005	005	And Simon responding said to Him, Master, having toiled all night, we caught nothing: but at thy word I will spread the net.
042	LUK	005	006	And having done this, they caught a great multitude of fishes; and their net was breaking;
042	LUK	005	007	and they beckoned to their comrades in another ship, having come to assist them, And they came, and filled both ships, so as to sink them.
042	LUK	005	008	And Simon Peter, seeing, fell down at the knees of Jesus, saying; Depart from me, Lord, because I am a sinful man,
042	LUK	005	009	For fear took hold of him, and all of those with him, at the draught of fishes which they received.
042	LUK	005	010	And likewise James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were companions to Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Fear not; from now you shall be catching men.
042	LUK	005	011	And drawing up their ships to the land, having left all things, they followed Him.
042	LUK	005	012	And it came to pass, while He was in one of the cities, and behold, there is a man full of leprosy: and seeing Jesus, having fallen on his face, he prayed to Him, saying, Lord, if you may will it, you are able to cleanse me.
042	LUK	005	013	And reaching out His hand, He touched him, saying, I will; be thou cleansed. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.
042	LUK	005	014	And He commanded him to tell no one: but having gone away, show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.
042	LUK	005	015	And the word concerning Him was going abroad: and many multitudes continued to come, and be healed of their diseases by Him.
042	LUK	005	016	And He was out in the deserts, and praying.
042	LUK	005	017	And He was in one of the cities, and was teaching; and there were many Pharisees and theologians, who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them.
042	LUK	005	018	And behold, men carrying a man on a couch, who was paralyzed; and were seeking to bring him in, and place him before Him.
042	LUK	005	019	And not having found by what way they may bring him in on account of the crowd, going upon the house, they let him down through the tiles along with the bed in their midst in the presence of Jesus.
042	LUK	005	020	And seeing their faith, He said to him; Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.
042	LUK	005	021	And the scribes and Pharisees began to reason, Who is this one who speaketh blasphemies? Who is able to forgive sins, except God only?
042	LUK	005	022	And having responded He said to them, Why do you reason in your hearts?
042	LUK	005	023	Which is the easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven unto thee; or, to say. Arise and walk about?
042	LUK	005	024	But in order that you may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, (He said to the paralyzed), I say unto thee, Arise, and having taken thy bed, go into thy house.
042	LUK	005	025	And immediately having arisen before them, taking the bed on which he was lying down, he went away to his own house, glorifying God.
042	LUK	005	026	And rapture seized them all, and they continued to glorify God; and they were filled with fear, saying, that, We have seen the paradoxical this day.
042	LUK	005	027	And after these things He came out, and saw a publican, by name Levi, sitting at the toll, and He said to him, Follow me.
042	LUK	005	028	And having left all things, rising up, he followed Him.
042	LUK	005	029	And Levi made a great feast for Him in his own house: and there was a great multitude of publicans and others who were sitting along with Him.
042	LUK	005	030	And their scribes and the Pharisees were murmuring to His disciples, saying, Wherefore do you eat and drink with publicans and, sinners?
042	LUK	005	031	And Jesus responding said to them, They that are whole have not need of a physician, but they that are sick;
042	LUK	005	032	I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
042	LUK	005	033	And they said to Him, Wherefore do the disciples of John fast, and make supplications; likewise also those of the Pharisees; but thy disciples eat and drink?
042	LUK	005	034	And He said to them, Whether are you able to make the sons of the bridechamber to fast, while the bridegroom is with them?
042	LUK	005	035	But the days will come when the bridegroom must indeed be taken away from them, then will they fast in those days.
042	LUK	005	036	He also spoke a parable to them; Let no one put a piece of new cloth on an old garment; lest the new shall tear it, and the piece from the new will not fit the old.
042	LUK	005	037	And no one puts new wine into old bottles; lest the new wine shall break the bottles, and it shall be poured out, and the bottles shall perish:
042	LUK	005	038	but the new wine is to be put into new bottles, and both will be preserved.
042	LUK	005	039	No one drinking the old immediately wishes the new; for he says, The old is better.
042	LUK	006	001	And it came to pass on the second Sabbath, He was going through the cornfields; and His disciples were plucking the ears, and eating, shelling them out with their hands.
042	LUK	006	002	And certain ones of the Pharisees said to them, Why are you doing that which is not lawful to do on the Sabbath?
042	LUK	006	003	Jesus responded and said to them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was hungry, and those being with him?
042	LUK	006	004	How he entered into the house of God, and how he took the shewbread, and ate it, and gave it to those with him; which is not lawful to eat, except the priests only?
042	LUK	006	005	And He said to them, The Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath also.
042	LUK	006	006	And it came to pass on another Sabbath, that He came into the synagogue and taught, and a man was there, whose right hand was withered.
042	LUK	006	007	And the scribes and Pharisees were watching Him, if He will heal him on the Sabbath, in order that they may find accusation against Him.
042	LUK	006	008	But He knew their thoughts, and said to the man having the withered hand, Rise up, and stand in the midst; and he having arisen stood.
042	LUK	006	009	And Jesus said to them, I will ask you; What is lawful on the Sabbath; to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy?
042	LUK	006	010	And looking around upon them all, He said to him, Reach forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored.
042	LUK	006	011	And they were filled with rage; and they were talking one to another what they might do to Jesus.
042	LUK	006	012	And it came to pass in those days, that He went out into the mountain to pray; and was there through the night in the prayer of God.
042	LUK	006	013	And when it was day, He called His disciples to Him: and having chosen twelve from them, whom He also named apostles;
042	LUK	006	014	Simon, whom He also named Peter, and Andrew his brother, James and John. Philip and Bartholomew,
042	LUK	006	015	Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alpheus, and Simon called the Zealot;
042	LUK	006	016	and Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, who also became His betrayer.
042	LUK	006	017	And having come down with them, He stood upon a level place, and a great multitude of His disciples, and a great crowd of people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and Tyre and Sidon by the sea, who came to hear Him, and to be healed of their diseases;
042	LUK	006	018	and those troubled by unclean spirits; and they were getting healed.
042	LUK	006	019	And the whole multitude sought to touch Him: because power was going out from Him, and was healing all.
042	LUK	006	020	And He lifting up His eyes to His disciples, said, Blessed are ye poor: because the kingdom of God is yours.
042	LUK	006	021	Blessed are ye who hunger now: because ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye who weep now: because ye shall laugh.
042	LUK	006	022	Blessed are ye, when the people may hate you, and when they may separate you, and cast out your name as evil, for the sake of the Son of man.
042	LUK	006	023	Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy: for behold your reward in heaven is great: for according to these things were their fathers accustomed to do to the prophets.
042	LUK	006	024	Moreover woe unto you rich! because you exhaust your reward.
042	LUK	006	025	Woe unto you who are full! because you shall hunger. Woe unto you who are now laughing because you shall weep and mourn.
042	LUK	006	026	Woe unto you when all the people may speak well of you! because according to the same things their fathers were accustomed to do to the false prophets.
042	LUK	006	027	But I say unto you that hear, Love your enemies with divine love, and do good to those that hate you,
042	LUK	006	028	bless those who curse you, and pray for those who despitefully use you.
042	LUK	006	029	To the one smiting thee on the cheek turn the other also; and from the one taking away thy cloak do not withhold even the coat.
042	LUK	006	030	Give to every one asking thee, and turn not away from the one taking thy possessions,
042	LUK	006	031	And as you wish that the people may do unto you, do ye unto them even likewise.
042	LUK	006	032	If you love those who love you, what grace is there to you? for even sinners love those who love them.
042	LUK	006	033	And if you may do good to those doing good to you, what grace is there to you? for sinners also do the same.
042	LUK	006	034	And if you may lend to those from whom you may hope to receive, what grace is there to you? for sinners lend to sinners, that they may receive back the equivalent.
042	LUK	006	035	Moreover love your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping nothing in return; and your reward shall be great, and you shall be the sons of the Highest: because He is good to the ungrateful and wicked.
042	LUK	006	036	Therefore be ye merciful, as your Father is indeed merciful.
042	LUK	006	037	And criticise not, and you can not be criticised. Condemn not, and you can not be condemned.
042	LUK	006	038	Forgive, and you shall be forgiven: give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, heaped up, and shaken down, and running over, they will give into your bosom. For with the same measure, which you measure, it will be measured unto you.
042	LUK	006	039	And He spoke a parable unto them, Whether is the blind able to lead the blind? will they not both fall into the ditch?
042	LUK	006	040	The disciple is not above his teacher; but every one having been made perfect shall be as his teacher.
042	LUK	006	041	But why do you see the mote which is in the eye of your brother, and do not recognize the beam which is in your own eye?
042	LUK	006	042	Or how are you able to say to your brother; Brother, permit me, I will cast out the mote which is in thine eye, yourself not seeing the beam which is in your own eye? O hypocrite, first cast out the beam from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to cast out the mote which is in the eye of your brother.
042	LUK	006	043	For there is no beautiful tree producing corrupt fruit, nor corrupt tree producing beautiful fruit.
042	LUK	006	044	For every tree is known by its own fruit: for they do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather the grape-bunch from the bramble.
042	LUK	006	045	The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth the good; and the wicked man out of the wicked treasure of his heart brings forth that which is wicked: for out of the abundance of his heart his mouth speaks.
042	LUK	006	046	But why do you call me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?
042	LUK	006	047	Every one coming to me, and hearing my words, and doing the same, I will show you to whom he is like.
042	LUK	006	048	He is like unto a man building a house, who dug and went down deep, and laid the foundation upon the rock: and there being a flood, the river broke against that house, and it was not able to shake it; for it was founded on the rock.
042	LUK	006	049	But the one hearing and not doing, is like unto a man building his house upon the ground without a foundation; against which the river broke, and it fell immediately, and great was the fall of that house.
042	LUK	007	001	When He completed all His words in the ears of the people, He came into Capernaum.
042	LUK	007	002	And the servant of a certain centurion, being sick, was about to die, who was precious to him.
042	LUK	007	003	And hearing about Jesus, he sent elders of the Jews to Him, asking Him that having come He may save his servant.
042	LUK	007	004	And they, having come to Jesus, continued to entreat Him earnestly, saying, That he to whom He will do this is worthy:
042	LUK	007	005	for he loves our race, and himself built for us a synagogue.
042	LUK	007	006	And Jesus went along with them. And already He being not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to Him, saying to Him, Lord, be not troubled: for I am not worthy that you may come in under my roof:
042	LUK	007	007	Therefore I did not count myself worthy to come to thee; but speak the word, and my servant shall be healed.
042	LUK	007	008	For I am also a man placed under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.
042	LUK	007	009	And Jesus, having heard these words, was astonished at him, and turning to the multitude following said, I say unto you, I did not find so great faith in Israel.
042	LUK	007	010	And those having been sent, returning to the house, found the servant well.
042	LUK	007	011	And it came to pass consecutively, He departed into a city called Nain; and His many disciples and a great multitude went along with Him.
042	LUK	007	012	And when He drew nigh unto the gate of the city, behold, a dead man, an only born son to his mother, and she a widow, was indeed being carried out: and a great multitude of the city was along with her.
042	LUK	007	013	And the Lord seeing her, was moved with compassion towards her, and said to her, Weep not.
042	LUK	007	014	And having come forward He touched the bier: and the pall-bearers stood still: and He said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.
042	LUK	007	015	And the dead man sat up, and began to talk, and Ile gave him to his mother.
042	LUK	007	016	And fear seized them all: and they continued to glorify God, saying that, A great prophet has arisen among us: and, God has looked upon His people.
042	LUK	007	017	And that word about Him went out in all Judea, and all the country round about.
042	LUK	007	018	And His disciples proclaimed to John concerning all these things.
042	LUK	007	019	And John calling certain two of his disciples sent them to the Lord, saying, Art thou the one coming, or must we expect another?
042	LUK	007	020	And the men having come to Him, said; John the Baptist sent us to thee, saving; Art thou the one coming, or must we expect another?
042	LUK	007	021	And at that hour He healed many of their diseases and ailments and evil spirits; and He conferred on many blind people the power to see.
042	LUK	007	022	And Jesus responding said to them, Having gone, proclaim to John those things which you saw and heard; that the blind are seeing, the lame are walking about, the lepers are being cleansed, the deaf are hearing, the dead are being raised up, the poor are having the gospel preached unto them;
042	LUK	007	023	and happy is he whosoever may not be offended in me.
042	LUK	007	024	And the messengers of John having gone away, He began to speak to the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? a reed shaken by the wind?
042	LUK	007	025	But what went you out into the wilderness to see? a man clothed in soft raiment? Behold those who are in gaudy apparel and luxury, are in royal palaces.
042	LUK	007	026	But what went you out to see? a prophet? Yea, and I say unto you even more than a prophet.
042	LUK	007	027	This is he concerning whom it has been written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who will prepare thy way before thee.
042	LUK	007	028	I say unto you, among those having been born of women no prophet is greater than John the Baptist; nevertheless the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.
042	LUK	007	029	And all the people hearing and the publicans justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.
042	LUK	007	030	But the Pharisees and theologians rejected the counsel of God, against themselves, not having been baptized by him.
042	LUK	007	031	Then to whom shall I liken the men of this generation, and to whom are they like?
042	LUK	007	032	They are like unto little children sitting in the market-place, and calling to one another, and saying, We piped unto you, and you did not dance; we mourned unto you, and you did not weep.
042	LUK	007	033	For John the Baptist has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and you say, He has a demon.
042	LUK	007	034	The Son of man has come eating and drinking, and you say, Behold, a gluttonous wine-drinking man, a friend of publicans and sinners.
042	LUK	007	035	Truly wisdom is justified by her children.
042	LUK	007	036	And a certain one of the Pharisees, asked Him, that He would eat with him, and having come into the house of the Pharisee, He sat down to the table.
042	LUK	007	037	Behold, a woman who was a sinner, in the city, also having learned that He is dining in the house of the Pharisee, breaking an alabaster box of myrrh,
042	LUK	007	038	and standing behind by His feet, weeping, began to moisten His feel with tears, and she wiped them with the hairs of her head, and she continued to copiously kiss His feet, and to anoint them with the myrrh.
042	LUK	007	039	And the Pharisee, having invited Him, seeing, spoke within himself, saying, If He were a prophet, He would know who and what kind the woman is, who touches Him, because she is a sinner.
042	LUK	007	040	And Jesus responding said to him, Simon, I have something to say to thee. And he says, Speak, Teacher.
042	LUK	007	041	There were two debtors to a certain creditor: the one owed him five hundred denaria, and the other fifty.
042	LUK	007	042	And they not being able to pay, he forgave them both. Then which one of them will love him the more?
042	LUK	007	043	Simon responding said, I perceive, that he, to whom he forgave the more. And He said to him, You answered correctly.
042	LUK	007	044	And turning to the woman He said to Simon, Do you see this woman? I came into thy house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with her hairs.
042	LUK	007	045	Thou gavest me no kiss: she, from the time I came in, did not cease copiously kissing my feet.
042	LUK	007	046	Thou didst not anoint my head with oil: but she anointed my feet with myrrh.
042	LUK	007	047	Therefore I say unto thee, her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but he to whom little is forgiven, loveth little.
042	LUK	007	048	And He said to her; Thy sins are forgiven.
042	LUK	007	049	And those sitting along with Him began to say among themselves, Who is this who even forgives sins?
042	LUK	007	050	And He said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved them; go in peace.
042	LUK	008	001	And it came to pass consecutively, that He was going through city and village, proclaiming and preaching the gospel of God, and the twelve along with Him.
042	LUK	008	002	And certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out,
042	LUK	008	003	and Joanna the wife of Chuzas the steward of Herod, and Susanna, and many other women, who were accustomed to minister unto Him from those things belonging to them.
042	LUK	008	004	A great multitude being with Him, and coming to Him throughout every city, He spoke in a parable:
042	LUK	008	005	A sower went out to sow his seed. And while he was sowing, some fell by the way, and was trodden under foot, and the birds of the air devoured it.
042	LUK	008	006	And other fell on the rock; and springing up, withered away, because it had no moisture.
042	LUK	008	007	And other fell in the midst of thorns, and the thorns growing together, choked it out.
042	LUK	008	008	And other fell into good ground, and springing up, produced fruit, a hundredfold. Speaking these things, He cried out, Let the one having ears to hear, hear.
042	LUK	008	009	And His disciples asked Him saying, What might this parable be?
042	LUK	008	010	And He said; To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to the rest in parables; in order that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.
042	LUK	008	011	And this is the parable: The seed is the word of God.
042	LUK	008	012	And there are those who hear by the wayside; then the devil comes, and takes away the word from their heart, lest they believing may be saved.
042	LUK	008	013	And those on the stones are they who, when they may hear, receive the word with joy; and they have no root in them, who believe for a time, and in time of temptation they fall away.
042	LUK	008	014	And that which falleth among thorns, there are those who hear, and going forward, by the cares and riches and pleasures are choked out, and bring forth no fruit to perfection.
042	LUK	008	015	And that which is in the good ground, are those whosoever hearing the word in a beautiful and good heart, retain it, and bring forth fruit with patience.
042	LUK	008	016	But no one having lighted a candle covers it with a vessel, or puts it under a bed; but he places it on a candlestick, in order that those coming in may see the light.
042	LUK	008	017	For there is nothing hidden which shall not be made manifest; neither is there any thing concealed, which may not be made known and come into the light.
042	LUK	008	018	Therefore see how you hear: for whosoever may have, it shall be given unto him; and whosoever may not have, it shall be taken from him, even that which he seems to have.
042	LUK	008	019	And His mother and His brothers came to Him, and were not able to reach Him on account of the crowd.
042	LUK	008	020	And it was told Him, Thy mother and thy brothers stand without, wishing to see thee.
042	LUK	008	021	And He responding said to them, My mother and my brothers are the ones hearing the word of God, and doing it.
042	LUK	008	022	And it came to pass on one of the days, He and His disciples went into a ship. And He said to them, Let us go to the other side of the lake. And they were embarked.
042	LUK	008	023	And they sailing, He was asleep: and a storm of wind came down into the lake; and they were being filled, and imperiled.
042	LUK	008	024	And they having come to Him, awakened Him, saying, Master, Master, we perish. And He having arisen, rebuked the wind and the wave of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.
042	LUK	008	025	And He said to them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid were astonished, saying to one another, Who then is this, because He commands the winds and the water, and they obey Him?
042	LUK	008	026	And they sailed into the country of the Gergesenes, which is over against Galilee.
042	LUK	008	027	And a certain man from the city, who a long time had demons, and did not wear clothing, and did not remain in the house, but in the tombs; met Him having come to the land.
042	LUK	008	028	And seeing Jesus, and crying out, he worshiped Him, and said with a loud voice; What is there to me and to thee, O Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I pray thee torment me not.
042	LUK	008	029	For He commanded the unclean spirit to come out from the man; for since a long time he had possessed him, and he was frequently bound, secured with chains and fetters, and smashing his bonds, was driven by the demons into the desert.
042	LUK	008	030	And Jesus asked him saying, What is thy name? And he said Legion; because many demons entered into him.
042	LUK	008	031	And he continued to intreat Him that He should not command them to depart into the abyss.
042	LUK	008	032	And there was a herd of many swine feeding in the mountain: and they continued to intreat Him that He should permit them to go into them. And He permitted them.
042	LUK	008	033	And the demons having come out from the man, came into the swine: and the herd rushed down a precipice into the sea, and were strangled.
042	LUK	008	034	And the herders seeing that which took place, fled, and proclaimed it in the city and in the country.
042	LUK	008	035	And they came out to see that which had happened; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the demons had gone, clothed and in his right mind, at the feet of Jesus: and they were afraid.
042	LUK	008	036	And those seeing reported to them how the demonized man was saved.
042	LUK	008	037	And all the multitudes of the surrounding country of the Gergesenes, asked Him to depart from them; because they were seized with great fear. And He having come Into the ship, returned.
042	LUK	008	038	And the man out of whom the demons had gone prayed to be with Him. And Jesus sent him away, saying,
042	LUK	008	039	Return to thy own house, and relate, how many things God has done unto thee. And he departed throughout the whole city, preaching how many things Jesus did unto him.
042	LUK	008	040	And it came to pass when Jesus returned, the multitude received Him; for they were all looking for Him.
042	LUK	008	041	Behold, a man to whom was the name Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and falling at the feet of Jesus, he continued to intreat Him to come into his house;
042	LUK	008	042	for there was an only daughter to him, of twelve years, and she was dying. And while He was going the multitudes were thronging Him.
042	LUK	008	043	And a woman being in an issue of blood twelve years, who having expended all her living with physicians, was not able to be healed by any of them,
042	LUK	008	044	and having come to Him behind, she touched the hem of His garment: and immediately the issue of blood ceased.
042	LUK	008	045	And Jesus said, Who is the one having touched me? And all denying, Peter and the disciples with Him said, The multitudes crowd thee and press upon thee, and dost thou say, Who is the one having touched me?
042	LUK	008	046	And Jesus said, Some one touched me: for I know the power went out from me.
042	LUK	008	047	And the woman seeing that she was not concealed, came trembling, and falling down before Him, proclaimed on account of what cause she touched Him, in the presence of all the people, and how she was healed immediately.
042	LUK	008	048	And He said to her, Be of good cheer, daughter; thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.
042	LUK	008	049	And He yet speaking, a certain one comes from the house of the chief ruler of the synagogue, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Teacher:
042	LUK	008	050	and Jesus hearing, responded to him, saying, Fear not: only believe, and she shall be saved.
042	LUK	008	051	And having come to the house, He did not suffer any to enter except Peter, John, and James, and the father and mother of the child.
042	LUK	008	052	And they were all weeping, and wailing over her: and He said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.
042	LUK	008	053	And they hooted at Him, knowing that she was dead.
042	LUK	008	054	And having put all out, taking her by the hand, He spoke, saying, Child, arise.
042	LUK	008	055	And her spirit returned, and she stood up immediately. And He commanded that something should be given to her to eat.
042	LUK	008	056	And her parents were delighted: and He commanded them to tell no one that which had taken place.
042	LUK	009	001	And calling the twelve, He gave to them power and authority over all demons, and to heal diseases.
042	LUK	009	002	And He sent them to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.
042	LUK	009	003	And He said to them, Take nothing for the journey, neither staff, nor valise, nor bread, nor silver; nor to have two coats.
042	LUK	009	004	And into whatsoever house you may eaten there abide, and go out from thence.
042	LUK	009	005	And so many as may not receive you, going out from that city, knock off the dust of your feet for a testimony against them.
042	LUK	009	006	And going out, they continued to go through the villages, everywhere preaching the gospel, and healing.
042	LUK	009	007	And Herod the tetrarch heard all things which were wrought by Him; and was at a loss, because it was said by some, that John is risen from the dead;
042	LUK	009	008	and by some that Elijah has appeared; and by others that one of the old prophets is arisen.
042	LUK	009	009	And Herod said, I beheaded John: but who is this, concerning whom I hear these things? And he was seeking to see Him.
042	LUK	009	010	And the apostles having returned, expounded unto Him how many things they did. And taking them He departed privately into a desert place, belonging to the city called Bethsaida.
042	LUK	009	011	And the multitudes having found out, followed Him And receiving them, He spoke to them concerning the kingdom of God, and healed those having need of healing.
042	LUK	009	012	And the day began to decline; and the twelve coming to Him, said, Send away the multitude, in order that having gone into the surrounding villages and countries, they may lodge, and find food: because we are here in a desert place.
042	LUK	009	013	And He said to them, You give them to eat. And they said, There is not to us more than five loaves and two fishes; if not having gone we must purchase victuals for all this people.
042	LUK	009	014	For the men were about five thousand. And He said to His disciples, Have them sit down in companies, about fifty.
042	LUK	009	015	And they did thus, and made all sit down.
042	LUK	009	016	And taking the five loaves and two fishes, looking up to heaven, He blessed them; and He broke, and gave to the disciples to dispense to the multitude.
042	LUK	009	017	And they all ate and were filled: and that which remained to them of the fragments, were taken up, twelve baskets.
042	LUK	009	018	It came to pass, while He was praying alone, His disciples came to Him. And He asked them, saying, Whom do the multitudes say that I am?
042	LUK	009	019	They responding said, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and others, that one of the old prophets is risen.
042	LUK	009	020	And He said to them, But whom do you say that I am? And Peter responding said, The Christ of God.
042	LUK	009	021	And having charged them, He commanded them to tell it to no one.
042	LUK	009	022	Saying, That it behooved the Son of man to suffer many things, and to be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes and to be killed, and to rise the third day.
042	LUK	009	023	And He spoke to all, If any one wishes to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.
042	LUK	009	024	For whosoever may wish to save his soul shall lose it; and whosoever may lose his soul for my sake, he shall save it.
042	LUK	009	025	For what is a man profited, gaining the whole world, and losing or forfeiting himself?
042	LUK	009	026	For whosoever may be ashamed of me and my words, the Son of man will be ashamed of him, when He may come in His glory, and that of the Father, and that of the holy angels.
042	LUK	009	027	And truly I say unto you, There are some of those standing here, who may not taste of death, until they may see the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	009	028	And it came to pass after these discourses, about eight days, and taking Peter and John and James, He went up into the mountain to pray.
042	LUK	009	029	And it came to pass while He was praying, the appearance of His countenance was changed, and His raiment shining white.
042	LUK	009	030	And behold two men were talking with Him, who were Moses and Elijah:
042	LUK	009	031	who being seen in glory, was speaking of His departure which He was about to perfect in Jerusalem.
042	LUK	009	032	And Peter and those who were along with Him, were burdened with sleep. And having watched through the night, they saw His glory and the two men who were standing with him.
042	LUK	009	033	It came to pass when they departed from Him, Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah: not knowing what he says.
042	LUK	009	034	And he speaking these things there was a cloud, and it overshadowed them; and they were afraid while they were entering into the cloud.
042	LUK	009	035	And there was a voice from the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear ye Him. And while the voice is heard, Jesus is found alone.
042	LUK	009	036	And they were silent, and they told no one during those days any of those things which they had seen
042	LUK	009	037	And it came to pass, on the following day, they having come down from the mountain, a multitude met Him.
042	LUK	009	038	And behold, a man from the multitude cried out, saying, Teacher, I pray thee look upon my son, because he is to me an only child:
042	LUK	009	039	and behold, the spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out; and he convulses him with foam, and scarcely departs from him, contorting him.
042	LUK	009	040	And I besought thy disciples, that they should cast him out; and they were not able.
042	LUK	009	041	And Jesus responding said, O ye faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and bear with you? Bring your son hither.
042	LUK	009	042	And he yet coming, the demon dashed him down and convulsed him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the child, and gave him to his father.
042	LUK	009	043	And all were astonished at the majesty of God. And all being astonished at all things which Jesus did, He said to His disciples,
042	LUK	009	044	You place these words in your ears: for the Son of man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men.
042	LUK	009	045	And they did not understand this word, and it was hidden from them, in order that they should not understand it: and they were afraid to ask Him concerning this word.
042	LUK	009	046	And a dispute came in among them, as to which one of them might be the greater.
042	LUK	009	047	And Jesus seeing the dispute of their heart, taking a little child, He placed it by Himself,
042	LUK	009	048	and said to them, Whosoever may receive this little child in my name receives me; and whosoever may receive me receives him that sent me. For he who is least among you all, the same shall be great.
042	LUK	009	049	And John responding said, Master, we saw one casting out the demons in thy name; and we forbade him, because he does not follow with us.
042	LUK	009	050	And Jesus said to him, Forbid him not; for whosoever is not against us is on our side.
042	LUK	009	051	And it came to pass while the days of His taking up were being fulfilled, and He turned His face to go to Jerusalem,
042	LUK	009	052	and He sent messengers before His face. And they going forward, entered into a city of the Samaritans, in order to prepare for Him;
042	LUK	009	053	and they did not receive Him, because His face was going toward Jerusalem.
042	LUK	009	054	And the disciples James and John, seeing, said, Lord, do you wish that we may command fire to descend from heaven and consume them?
042	LUK	009	055	And He turning, rebuked them.
042	LUK	009	056	And they went into another village.
042	LUK	009	057	And they going on the way, a certain one said to Him, Lord, I will follow thee wheresoever thou mayest go.
042	LUK	009	058	And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of heaven nests; but the Son of man has not a place where He may recline His head.
042	LUK	009	059	And He said to another, Follow thou me. And he said, Lord, permit me first having gone away to bury my father.
042	LUK	009	060	And Jesus said to him, Let the dead bury their dead; but thou having gone away proclaim the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	009	061	And another said to Him, Lord, I will follow thee; but first permit me to bid adieu to those at my own home.
042	LUK	009	062	And Jesus said to him, No one putting his hand to the plow, and looking back, is worthy of the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	010	001	After these things the Lord chose seventy others also, and sent them out two by two before His face, into every place and city, where He was about to come.
042	LUK	010	002	And He said to them, The harvest is indeed great, but the laborers are few: therefore pray you the Lord of the harvest, that He may send forth laborers into His harvest.
042	LUK	010	003	Go: behold, I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves.
042	LUK	010	004	Take neither purse, nor valise, nor sandals: salute no one by the way.
042	LUK	010	005	Into whatsoever house you may enter, first say, Peace be unto this house.
042	LUK	010	006	And if the son of peace may be there, your peace shall rest upon it: but if not, it shall return unto you.
042	LUK	010	007	Abide in the same house, eating and drinking those things which are with them: for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house.
042	LUK	010	008	Into whatsoever city you may enter and they may receive you, eat those things which are placed by you:
042	LUK	010	009	and heal the sick who are in it, and say to them, The kingdom of God has come nigh unto you.
042	LUK	010	010	And into whatsoever city you may enter, and they may not receive you, having come out into the streets of the same, say,
042	LUK	010	011	Even the dust from your city, that cleaveth to our feet, do we wipe off against you: but know this, that the kingdom of God is at hand.
042	LUK	010	012	For I say unto you, that it will be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city.
042	LUK	010	013	Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works which were wrought in you had been in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting down in sackcloth and ashes.
042	LUK	010	014	Moreover it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.
042	LUK	010	015	And thou, Capernaum, art thou not exalted up to heaven? thou shalt be cast down to Hades.
042	LUK	010	016	He that heareth you heareth me; he that rejecteth you rejecteth me; and he that rejecteth me rejecteth Him that sent me.
042	LUK	010	017	And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subordinated to us in thy name.
042	LUK	010	018	And He said to them, I saw Satan having fallen as the lightning from heaven.
042	LUK	010	019	Behold I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing shall hurt you.
042	LUK	010	020	Moreover do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rejoice that your names are written in the heavens.
042	LUK	010	021	At the same hour He rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, I praise thee, O Father, Lord of the heaven and the earth, because thou hast hidden these things from the wise and prudent, and revealed them to babes: yea, Father, because it was thus pleasing in thy sight.
042	LUK	010	022	And turning to His disciples, He said, All things have been delivered to me by my Father: and no one knoweth who the Son is, except the Father; and who the Father is, except the Son, and he to whom He may wish to reveal Him.
042	LUK	010	023	And turning to His disciples, privately He said, Happy are your eyes, seeing those things which you see.
042	LUK	010	024	For I say unto you, that many kings and prophets desired to see those things which you see, and saw them not; and to hear those things which you hear, and heard them not.
042	LUK	010	025	And behold, a certain lawyer stood up tempting Him, saying, Teacher, having done what shall I inherit eternal life?
042	LUK	010	026	He said to him, What has been written in the law? how do you read it?
042	LUK	010	027	And he responding said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with divine love from all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.
042	LUK	010	028	And He said to him, You answered correctly: do this, and you shall live.
042	LUK	010	029	But he, wishing to justify himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbor?
042	LUK	010	030	Jesus responding said, A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho; and fell among thieves, who indeed having stripped him of his raiment, administered blows, went away, leaving him half dead.
042	LUK	010	031	And by chance a certain priest came down that way: and seeing him, passed by on the other side.
042	LUK	010	032	And likewise also a Levite, being at the place, coming and seeing, passed by on the other side.
042	LUK	010	033	And a certain Samaritan, on a journey, came near him: and seeing, had compassion on him,
042	LUK	010	034	and having come to him, he bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine: and having mounted him on his own beast, carried him to a tavern, and cared for him.
042	LUK	010	035	And on the morrow, taking out two denaria, gave them to the host, and said, Care for him; and whatsoever you expend in addition, on my return, I will pay you.
042	LUK	010	036	Which one of these three seems to you to have been the neighbor of him who fell among the thieves?
042	LUK	010	037	And he said, The one having done mercy with him. And Jesus said to him, Go, thou, and do likewise.
042	LUK	010	038	And it came to pass while they were going round, He also came into a certain village: and a certain woman by name Martha received Him into her house.
042	LUK	010	039	And there was a sister to her called Mary, who indeed sitting down at the feet of the Lord, continued to hear his word:
042	LUK	010	040	and Martha was very busy about much serving. And standing over Him, she said, Lord, is there no care to thee that my sister has left me to serve alone? then say to her that she must assist me.
042	LUK	010	041	And the Lord responding said to her, Martha, Martha, you are solicitous and encumbered concerning many things:
042	LUK	010	042	but there is need of one thing: for Mary has chosen the good part, which shall not be taken from her.
042	LUK	011	001	And it came to pass, that He was in a certain place praying; when He ceased, one of His disciples said to Him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.
042	LUK	011	002	And He said to them, When you pray, say, Our Father, let thy name be hallowed: let thy kingdom come:
042	LUK	011	003	give unto us this day our daily bread:
042	LUK	011	004	and forgive us our sins; for we also do forgive every one owing us: and lead us not into temptation.
042	LUK	011	005	And He said to them, Which one of you shall have a friend, and go to him at midnight, and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves;
042	LUK	011	006	since my friend came to me from the road, and I have nothing which I may place before him.
042	LUK	011	007	And he responding from within, said, Do not give me trouble: the door has already been closed, and my children are in bed with me; I am not able rising to give unto thee.
042	LUK	011	008	I say unto you, If indeed having risen he will not give unto him, because he is his friend, yet on account of his shamelessness, rising he will give him as much as he needs.
042	LUK	011	009	And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given unto you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.
042	LUK	011	010	For every one asking receives; and the one seeking finds; and to the one knocking it shall be opened.
042	LUK	011	011	And which father of you shall if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone? or indeed a fish, will he instead of a fish give him a serpent?
042	LUK	011	012	Or indeed shall he ask an egg, will he give him a scorpion?
042	LUK	011	013	If then you, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, then how much more will your Father who is from heaven give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him?
042	LUK	011	014	And He was casting out a demon, and he was dumb: and it came to pass, the demon having gone out, the dumb spoke; and the multitudes were astonished.
042	LUK	011	015	And certain ones of them said, He casts out the demon through Beelzebul, the prince of the demons.
042	LUK	011	016	And others tempting, continued to seek with Him a sign from heaven.
042	LUK	011	017	And He, knowing their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself, comes to desolation, and house falls upon house.
042	LUK	011	018	And if Satan were indeed divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? Because you say I am casting out demons through Beelzebul.
042	LUK	011	019	But if I through Beelzebul cast out the demons, through whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges:
042	LUK	011	020	but if I through the finger of God cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come nigh unto you.
042	LUK	011	021	When the strong man armed may keep his palace, his goods are in peace:
042	LUK	011	022	but when one stronger than he, having come, may conquer him, he takes away his panoply in which he trusted, and divides his spoils.
042	LUK	011	023	The one not being with me is against me; and the one not gathering with me scatters abroad.
042	LUK	011	024	When the unclean spirit may go out from the man, he goes through dry places; seeking rest, and finding none, he says, I will return into my own house, whence I came out.
042	LUK	011	025	And having come he finds it swept and beautified.
042	LUK	011	026	Then he goes, and takes seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and having come in he dwells there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.
042	LUK	011	027	And it came to pass, while He is speaking these words, a certain woman lifting up her voice from the crowd, said to Him, Blessed is the womb having borne thee, and the breasts which thou didst suck.
042	LUK	011	028	And He said, Truly blessed are those hearing the word of God, and keeping it.
042	LUK	011	029	And the multitudes being assembled, He began to say, This is a wicked generation: it seeks after a sign, and no sign shall be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.
042	LUK	011	030	For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so shall the Son of man also be a sign to this generation.
042	LUK	011	031	The queen of the south will rise in judgment with this generation, and condemn them; because she came from the uttermost parts of the earth, to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.
042	LUK	011	032	The men of Nineveh will rise in judgment with this generation, and condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold a greater than Jonah is here.
042	LUK	011	033	No one, having lighted a lamp, putteth it in a cellar, nor under a bushel, but on a candlestick, in order that those coming in may see the light.
042	LUK	011	034	The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye may be clear, truly thy whole body is lighted; but when it may be had, truly thy body is dark.
042	LUK	011	035	See then that the light which is in thee is not darkness.
042	LUK	011	036	If then thy whole body is lighted, having no part dark, all will be lighted, as when a lamp may light thee with its brightness.
042	LUK	011	037	And while He was speaking, a Pharisee asked Him, that He would dine with him: and having come in, He sat up at the table.
042	LUK	011	038	And the Pharisee seeing, was astonished because He was not first baptized before dinner.
042	LUK	011	039	And the Lord said to him, Now you Pharisees purify the outside of the cup and the plate, but the interior is full of extortion and wickedness.
042	LUK	011	040	Ye fools, did not the One having made the outside also make the inside?
042	LUK	011	041	Therefore give alms of your substance; and behold all things are pure unto you.
042	LUK	011	042	But woe unto you, Pharisees! because you tithe mint and rue and every herb, and you pass by judgment and the love of God: it behooveth to do these things, and not to omit those.
042	LUK	011	043	Woe unto you, Pharisees! because you love the front seat in the synagogues, and salutations in the forums.
042	LUK	011	044	Woe unto you! because you are like tombs unseen, and men walking over them do not know it.
042	LUK	011	045	And a certain one of the theologians responding says to Him, Teacher, speaking these things yon indeed insult us.
042	LUK	011	046	And He said, Woe unto you, theologians! because you lay burdens on the people difficult to be borne, and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers.
042	LUK	011	047	Woe unto you! because you build the sepulchers of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.
042	LUK	011	048	Therefore you are witnesses and you consent unto the works of your fathers: because they slew them, and you build.
042	LUK	011	049	Therefore the wisdom of God said, I will send unto them prophets and apostles; and some of them they will slay and persecute.
042	LUK	011	050	In order that the blood of all the prophets poured out from the foundation of the world, may be required from this generation;
042	LUK	011	051	from the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the altar and the house; yea, I say unto you, it shall be required of this generation.
042	LUK	011	052	Woe unto you, theologians! because you have taken away the key of knowledge: you did not come in, and you prohibited those who were coming in.
042	LUK	011	053	And He having come out from thence, the scribes and Pharisees began vehemently to press on Him, and mouth after Him concerning many things;
042	LUK	011	054	laying in wait, to catch something from His mouth.
042	LUK	012	001	In the meantime, myriads of the multitude having gathered together, So that they trode on one another, He began to speak to His disciples first; Take heed unto yourselves from the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
042	LUK	012	002	But there is nothing hidden, which shall not be revealed: and concealed, that shall not be made known.
042	LUK	012	003	Therefore so many things as you spoke in the darkness shall be heard in the light; and whatsoever you spoke in the ear in the secret chambers shall be proclaimed upon the houses.
042	LUK	012	004	And I say unto you, my friends, Be not afraid of those killing the body, and after these things, having nothing more to do.
042	LUK	012	005	But I will show you whom you must fear: Fear him, who after he kills has power to cast into hell. Yea, I say unto you, Fear him.
042	LUK	012	006	Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? and one of them is not forgotten before God.
042	LUK	012	007	But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not: ye are more important than many sparrows.
042	LUK	012	008	But I say unto you, that every one who may confess me before the people, the Son of man will also confess him before the angels of God.
042	LUK	012	009	But the one denying me before the people will be denied before the angels of God.
042	LUK	012	010	And every one who shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but to him having blasphemed against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven.
042	LUK	012	011	But when they may carry you into the synagogues, and tribunals, and authorities; do not be solicitous as to what you may apologize, or what you may say:
042	LUK	012	012	for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that hour the things which it behooveth you to speak.
042	LUK	012	013	And a certain one from the multitude said to Him, Teacher, speak to my brother, to divide the inheritance with me.
042	LUK	012	014	And He said to him; Man, who established me judge or a divider over you?
042	LUK	012	015	And He said to them, See, and beware of all covetousness: because his life is not in that which aboundeth to any one, from those things belonging to him.
042	LUK	012	016	He spake a parable to them, saying, The farm of a certain rich man was very productive:
042	LUK	012	017	and he was reasoning in himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no place where I shall store my fruits?
042	LUK	012	018	And he said, I will do this: I will take down my barns, and build greater, and there I will gather all my fruits and my goods.
042	LUK	012	019	And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, be merry.
042	LUK	012	020	But God said to him, Thou fool, this night they are demanding thy soul from thee; and to whom shall those things which thou hast prepared, belong?
042	LUK	012	021	So is every one laying up treasure for himself, and not rich toward God.
042	LUK	012	022	And He spoke to His disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Be not solicitous for your soul, what you may eat; nor for your body, what you may put on.
042	LUK	012	023	The soul is more than food, and the body more than raiment.
042	LUK	012	024	Observe the ravens, because they neither sow nor reap; to which there is no storehouse nor barn, and God feeds them; are you not much better than the fowls?
042	LUK	012	025	And which one of you being solicitous is able to add one moment to his existence?
042	LUK	012	026	If then you are powerless in the smallest matter, why are you solicitous about other things?
042	LUK	012	027	Observe the lilies, how they toil not, neither do they spin: and I say unto you, That Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed as one of these.
042	LUK	012	028	And if God so clothes the verdure flourishing in the fields to-day, and to-morrow cast into the oven; how much more are you, O ye of little faith?
042	LUK	012	029	And do not seek what you may eat, and what you may drink, and with what you are clothed;
042	LUK	012	030	for the heathens of the world are seeking after all these things: but your Father knows that you have need of these things.
042	LUK	012	031	Moreover seek His kingdom and these things shall be added unto you.
042	LUK	012	032	Fear not, little flock; because your Father is well pleased to give you the kingdom.
042	LUK	012	033	Sell your possessions and give alms; make for yourselves purses that will not get old, and treasure in the heavens which can not be stolen, where the thief does not draw nigh, nor the moth corrupt.
042	LUK	012	034	For where your treasure is, there your heart will be.
042	LUK	012	035	Let your loins be girted, and your lamps burning;
042	LUK	012	036	and be you like unto men waiting for their lord, when he may rise up from the marriage feast; in order that, coming and knocking, they may open unto him immediately.
042	LUK	012	037	Blessed are those servants, whom the lord having come will find watching: truly I say unto you, that he will gird himself, and have them sit down, and having come will serve them.
042	LUK	012	038	If at the second, and third, watch he may come, happy are ye.
042	LUK	012	039	Know this, that if the landlord knew at what hour the thief cometh, he would not have permitted his house to be broken into.
042	LUK	012	040	Be ye also ready: because at an hour you do not think the Son of man cometh.
042	LUK	012	041	And Peter said to Him, Lord, do you speak this parable to us, or to all?
042	LUK	012	042	The Lord said, Who then is the faithful, wise steward, whom the lord will establish over his house-hold, to give them their food in season?
042	LUK	012	043	Happy is that servant, whom his lord having come shall thus find watching.
042	LUK	012	044	Truly I say unto you, that he will establish him over all his possessions.
042	LUK	012	045	But if that servant may say in his heart, my lord delayeth his coming, and may begin to smite the servants and handmaidens, and to eat and drink, and be drunken;
042	LUK	012	046	the lord of that servant will come in a day in which he does not expect, and in an hour in which he does not know, and will cut him off, and will appoint his part with the unbelievers.
042	LUK	012	047	But that servant knowing the will of his lord, and not preparing or doing according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.
042	LUK	012	048	But the one not knowing, and doing things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few. But to every one to whom much is given, much will be required of him: and to whom they commit much, of him they will ask the more.
042	LUK	012	049	I have come to send fire on the earth; and what do I will, if it is already kindled?
042	LUK	012	050	And I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it may be perfected!
042	LUK	012	051	Do you think that I have come to give peace on the earth? I say unto you, Nay, but division.
042	LUK	012	052	For from now, there shall be five in one house divided, three shall be divided against two, and two against three:
042	LUK	012	053	the father against the son, and the son against the father; and the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother-in-law against the daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law against the mother-in-law.
042	LUK	012	054	And he also spoke to the multitudes, When you may see a cloud rising from the west, you immediately say, that the rain cometh; and it is so:
042	LUK	012	055	and when the south wind is blowing, you say, that it will be hot; and it is so.
042	LUK	012	056	You hypocrites, you know how to discern the face of the earth and the firmament; and how do you not discern this time?
042	LUK	012	057	Why do you not judge righteous judgment, even with reference to yourselves?
042	LUK	012	058	For as you go with your adversary to the ruler, give attention on the way that you be reconciled with him; lest he may deliver you to the judge, and the judge shall turn you over to the officer, and the officer will cast you into prison.
042	LUK	012	059	I say unto you, You can by no means come out thence, till you have even paid the last mite.
042	LUK	013	001	And there were certain ones at that time announcing to him concerning the Galileans, whose blood Pilate mixed with their sacrifices.
042	LUK	013	002	And responding to them He said, Do you think that those Galileans were sinners above all the Galileans, because they suffered these things?
042	LUK	013	003	T say unto you, Nay: but unless you may repent, you shall all likewise perish.
042	LUK	013	004	Or those eighteen, on whom the tower in Saloam fell, and killed them, do you think that they were offenders above all the men that dwell in Jerusalem?
042	LUK	013	005	I say unto you, Nay: but unless you may repent, you will all likewise perish.
042	LUK	013	006	And He spoke this parable, A certain one had a fig-tree planted in his vineyard; and came seeking fruit on it and found none;
042	LUK	013	007	and he said to the vinedresser, Behold, three years from which I come seeking fruit on this fig-tree, and I find none: cut it down; why indeed does it cumber the ground?
042	LUK	013	008	And responding he says to him, Lord, let it alone also this year, until I shall dig about it, and cast manures:
042	LUK	013	009	and if it may bear fruit in the future; and if not you shall cut it down.
042	LUK	013	010	And He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.
042	LUK	013	011	And behold, a woman having a spirit of infirmity eighteen years; and she was bowed together, and not at all able to straighten up.
042	LUK	013	012	And Jesus seeing her, called to her, and said, Woman, thou art loosed from thy infirmity:
042	LUK	013	013	and He placed His hands on her: and immediately she straightened up, and continued to glorify God.
042	LUK	013	014	And the chief ruler of the synagogue, responding, being grieved because Jesus healed on the Sabbath, said to the multitude, There are six days in which it behooveth us to work: therefore during these, coming, be healed, and not on the Sabbath-day.
042	LUK	013	015	And the Lord responded to him, and said, Ye hypocrites, does not each one of you loose his ox or his donkey from the stall, and leading him away, give him water on the Sabbath?
042	LUK	013	016	Did it not behoove this one, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan bound, lo, these eighteen years, to be loosed from this bondage on the Sabbath-day?
042	LUK	013	017	And He speaking these things, all opposing Him became ashamed: and the whole multitude rejoiced over all the illustrious works wrought by Him.
042	LUK	013	018	Then He said, To what is the kingdom of God like? and to what shall I liken it?
042	LUK	013	019	It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man having taken, cast into his garden; and it grew, and became a tree; and the birds of heaven lodged in its branches.
042	LUK	013	020	And again He said, To what shall I liken the kingdom of God?
042	LUK	013	021	It is like leaven, which a woman having taken, hid in three measures of meal, until the whole was leavened.
042	LUK	013	022	And He was journeying through cities and villages, teaching, and making His journey towards Jerusalem.
042	LUK	013	023	And one said to Him, Lord, are the saved few? And He said to them,
042	LUK	013	024	Agonize to enter in through the narrow gate: because many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and will not be able.
042	LUK	013	025	When the landlord may rise up, and close the door, and you may begin to stand without, and knock at the door, saying, Lord, open unto us; and responding he will say unto you, I know not whence you are.
042	LUK	013	026	Then you will begin to say, We ate and drank in thy presence, and thou didst preach in our streets.
042	LUK	013	027	And he will say, I tell you, I know you not whence you are; depart from me, all you workers of iniquity.
042	LUK	013	028	And there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you cast out.
042	LUK	013	029	And they will come from the east and west, and the north and south, and will sit down in the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	013	030	And behold, the last shall be first, and the first shall be last.
042	LUK	013	031	At that hour certain Pharisees came to Him, saying; Depart, and go hence: because Herod wishes to slay thee.
042	LUK	013	032	And He said to them, Having gone, tell that fox, Behold, I cast out demons and perfect healings to-day and to-morrow, and on the third day I am made perfect.
042	LUK	013	033	Moreover it behooves Me to travel to-day and to-morrow and the day following: because it does not behoove a prophet to perish outside of Jerusalem.
042	LUK	013	034	O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them that have been sent unto thee! how frequently did I wish to gather thy children, in the manner in which a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye were not willing!
042	LUK	013	035	Behold, your house is left unto you desolate. I say unto you, that you can see me no more, until it shall come to pass that you may say, Blessed is the One coming in the name of the Lord.
042	LUK	014	001	And it came to pass when He entered into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on the Sabbath to eat bread, that they were watching Him.
042	LUK	014	002	And, behold, a certain dropsical man was before Him.
042	LUK	014	003	And Jesus responding spoke to the theologians and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath-day, or not? and they were silent.
042	LUK	014	004	And taking him by the hand, He healed him, and sent him away.
042	LUK	014	005	And responding to them He said; Of which one of you shall his son or his ox fall into a pit, and will he not immediately lift him out on the Sabbath-day?
042	LUK	014	006	and they were not able to respond to these things.
042	LUK	014	007	And He spoke a parable to those whom He had called, warning them that they should not choose the first couches; saying to them,
042	LUK	014	008	When you may be called by any one to a marriage feast, do not sit down upon the first couch; lest one more worthy than thee may have been called by him,
042	LUK	014	009	and the one having called thee and him, having come in shall say to thee, Give place to him; and then thou shalt with shame begin to take the last place.
042	LUK	014	010	But when you may be invited, coming in sit down in the last place; in order that when the one having invited thee may come, he will say to thee, Friend, come up higher: then there will be glory to thee in the presence of all those sitting along with thee.
042	LUK	014	011	Because every one who shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
042	LUK	014	012	And He spoke to the one having also invited Him, When you may make a dinner or a supper, do not call your rich friends, nor your brothers, nor your kindred, nor your neighbors; lest they may also invite thee in turn, and there may be a recompense unto thee.
042	LUK	014	013	But when you may make a feast, invite the poor, maimed, lame, blind:
042	LUK	014	014	and thou shalt be happy; because they have nothing with which to recompense thee: and it shall be recompensed unto thee in the resurrection of the just.
042	LUK	014	015	And a certain one of those sitting together, hearing these things, said to Him, Happy is he whosoever eateth bread in the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	014	016	And He said to him, A certain man made a great supper, and invited many;
042	LUK	014	017	and at the hour, of the supper he sent his servants to say to those who were invited, Come; because they are now ready.
042	LUK	014	018	And they all of one consent began to make excuse. The first said to him, I have bought a farm, and I have need having gone to see it: I pray thee have me excused.
042	LUK	014	019	And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove the same: I intreat thee have me excused.
042	LUK	014	020	Another said, I have married a wife, and on this account I am not able to come.
042	LUK	014	021	And the servant coming, announced these things to his lord. Then the land-lord being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and lead in hither the poor and maimed and blind and lame.
042	LUK	014	022	And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou didst command, and yet there is room.
042	LUK	014	023	And the lord said to the servant, Go out into the roads and hedges, and compel them to come in, in order that my house may be filled:
042	LUK	014	024	for I say unto you, that no one of these men who have been invited shall taste of my supper.
042	LUK	014	025	And many multitudes were journeying along with Him, and turning He said to them,
042	LUK	014	026	If any one comes to me, and does not hate his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers, and sisters, and even yet his own soul, he is not able to be my disciple.
042	LUK	014	027	Whosoever does not carry his cross, and come after me, is not able to be my disciple.
042	LUK	014	028	For which one of you, wishing to build a tower, does not first sitting down count the cost; if he has unto sufficiency?
042	LUK	014	029	Lest he having laid the foundation, and being unable to complete it, all who see it may begin to mock him,
042	LUK	014	030	saying, that this man began to build, and was not able to complete it.
042	LUK	014	031	Or what king, going forth to engage in war with another king, will not first sitting down counsel if he is able with ten thousand to meet him who is coming against him, with twenty thousand?
042	LUK	014	032	But if not, while he is yet a great way off, sending an embassy, he asks for those things which appertain to peace.
042	LUK	014	033	Thus then every one of you who does not consecrate all his possessions, is not able to be my disciple.
042	LUK	014	034	Therefore salt is good: but if the salt may lose its savor, with what shall it be salted?
042	LUK	014	035	It is neither good for the land nor for excrement: they cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
042	LUK	015	001	And all the publicans and sinners were drawing nigh to Him to hear Him.
042	LUK	015	002	And the Pharisees and scribes were murmuring, saying, that, He receives sinners, and eats with them.
042	LUK	015	003	And He spoke this parable to them, saying,
042	LUK	015	004	What man of you, having a hundred sheep, and having lost one of them, does not leave the ninety and nine in the desert, and go after the lost one, until he may find it?
042	LUK	015	005	And having found it, places it on his shoulders, rejoicing:
042	LUK	015	006	and having come into the house, calls together the friends and neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep which was lost.
042	LUK	015	007	I say unto you that so there will be joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, rather than ninety and nine just persons who have not need of repentance.
042	LUK	015	008	Or what woman having ten drachmae, if she may lose one drachma, does she not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she may find it?
042	LUK	015	009	And having found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, Rejoice with me, because I have found the drachma which I lost.
042	LUK	015	010	So, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.
042	LUK	015	011	And He said, A certain man had two sons.
042	LUK	015	012	And the younger of them said to the father, Father, give to me the portion of the estate that falls to me. And he immediately divided unto them his living.
042	LUK	015	013	And not many days afterward the younger son gathering all together, departed into a far-off country; and there wasted his substance living riotously.
042	LUK	015	014	And he having expended all, a severe famine came into that country; and he began to be in want.
042	LUK	015	015	And having gone he joined himself to one of the citizens of that country: and he sent him into his fields to feed swine:
042	LUK	015	016	and he was desiring to fill his stomach from the pods, which the swine were eating: and no one gave unto him:
042	LUK	015	017	and having come to himself he said, How many hired servants of my father have bread in abundance, but here I perish with hunger!
042	LUK	015	018	Having risen I will go to my father, and say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight:
042	LUK	015	019	and I am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.
042	LUK	015	020	And having risen, he came to his father. And he being yet a great way off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and having run, fell upon his neck, and kissed him copiously.
042	LUK	015	021	And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight: and I am no more worthy to be called thy son.
042	LUK	015	022	And the father said to his servants, Bring hither the first robe, and put it on him; and give a ring to his hand, and sandals to his feet:
042	LUK	015	023	and bring hither the fatted calf, slay him, and eating, let us be merry:
042	LUK	015	024	because this my son was dead, and is alive again; was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.
042	LUK	015	025	And his elder son was in the field: and while coming he drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.
042	LUK	015	026	And calling one of the servants, asked him what these things might be.
042	LUK	015	027	And he said to him, Because thy brother has come; and thy father has slain the fatted calf, because he received him sound.
042	LUK	015	028	And he was angry, and did not wish to come in: and his father having gone out, continued to intreat him. And responding he said to the father,
042	LUK	015	029	Behold, I serve thee so many years, and have never transgressed thy commandment: and thou hast never given me a kid, that I may rejoice with my friends:
042	LUK	015	030	but when this thy son, the one devouring thy living with harlots came, thou hast slain for him the fatted calf.
042	LUK	015	031	And he said to him, Child, thou art always with me, and all mine are thine:
042	LUK	015	032	and it behooved me to be glad and rejoice; because this thy brother was dead, and is alive; was lost, and is found.
042	LUK	016	001	And He also spoke to His disciples, There was a certain rich man, who had a steward; and he was slandered to him as wasting his goods.
042	LUK	016	002	And having called him, he said to him, What is this which I hear concerning thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou art not able to be steward any longer.
042	LUK	016	003	And the steward said within himself, What shall I do, because my lord takes away my stewardship from me? I am not able to dig; I am ashamed to beg.
042	LUK	016	004	I know what I shall do, in order that when I am deposed from the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.
042	LUK	016	005	And calling each one of the debtors of his lord, he said to the first, How much do you owe my lord?
042	LUK	016	006	And he said; A hundred measures of oil. And he said to him, Take your accounts, and sitting down quickly write fifty.
042	LUK	016	007	Then he said to another one, And how much do you owe? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. He says to him, Take your account, and write fourscore.
042	LUK	016	008	And the lord praised the steward of unrighteousness because he acted shrewdly: because the sons of this age are wiser in their generation than the sons of the light.
042	LUK	016	009	And I say unto you, Make unto yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness, in order that, when it may fail, they may receive you into eternal tabernacles.
042	LUK	016	010	He that is faithful in the least is also faithful in much: and he that is unrighteous in the least is unrighteous in much.
042	LUK	016	011	If therefore you were not faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will intrust to you the true?
042	LUK	016	012	If you were not faithful in the interest of another, who will give you your own?
042	LUK	016	013	No servant is able to serve two masters: for he will hate the one, and love the other; or he will cleave to the one, and despise the other. You are not able to serve God and mammon.
042	LUK	016	014	And the Pharisees, being avaricious, were hearing all these things, and murmuring against Him.
042	LUK	016	015	And He said to them, Ye are those who justify yourselves before the people; but God knows your hearts: because that which is exalted among the people is abomination in the sight of God.
042	LUK	016	016	The law and the prophets were until John: from that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every one presses into it.
042	LUK	016	017	And it is easier that heaven and earth pass away, than one tittle fall from the law.
042	LUK	016	018	Every one sending away his wife, and marrying another, commits adultery; and the one marrying her who has been sent away by her husband commits adultery.
042	LUK	016	019	There was a certain rich man, and he was habitually clothed in purple and fine linen, faring sumptuously every day.
042	LUK	016	020	But a certain beggar, Lazarus by name, was laid at his gate, full of sores,
042	LUK	016	021	and desiring to be fed by the crumbs falling from the table of the rich man; but the dogs also coming continued to lick his sores.
042	LUK	016	022	And it came to pass that the beggar died, and himself was carried by the angels into the bosom of Abraham: and the rich man also died, and was buried.
042	LUK	016	023	And in Hades lifted up his eyes, being in torment, sees Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.
042	LUK	016	024	And he calling said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue, because I am tormented in this flame.
042	LUK	016	025	But Abraham said, Child, remember that you received your good things in your life, and Lazarus likewise evil things: but now he is comforted, and you are tormented.
042	LUK	016	026	And in addition to all these things, there is a great gulf fixed between us and you, in order that those wishing to go hence to you may not be able, neither can they come thence to us.
042	LUK	016	027	And he said, Moreover I intreat you, father, that you may send him to the house of my father:
042	LUK	016	028	for I have five brothers; in order that he may testify to them, that they may not also come to this place of the torment.
042	LUK	016	029	But Abraham says, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.
042	LUK	016	030	But he said, No, father Abraham: but if one may go to them from the dead, they will repent.
042	LUK	016	031	But he said to him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, they will not be persuaded if one may rise from the dead.
042	LUK	017	001	And He spoke to His disciples, It is impossible for offenses not to come: but woe unto him, through whom they come;
042	LUK	017	002	it is good for him if a millstone is hung around his neck, and he is cast into the sea, rather than that he may offend one of these little ones.
042	LUK	017	003	Take heed to yourselves. If thy brother may sin, rebuke him; if he may repent, forgive him.
042	LUK	017	004	But if he may sin against thee seven times a day, and seven times turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.
042	LUK	017	005	And the apostles said to the Lord, Increase our faith.
042	LUK	017	006	And the Lord said, If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed. you should say to this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up, and planted in the sea; and it would obey you.
042	LUK	017	007	But which one of you, having a servant plowing or serving a shepherd, who will say to him, having come in from the field, Coming hither sit down immediately?
042	LUK	017	008	But will he not say to him, Prepare what I may sup, and girding thyself, minister unto me, until I may eat and drink; and after these things you eat and drink?
042	LUK	017	009	Whether does he thank the servant because he did the things which were commanded?
042	LUK	017	010	Likewise also, when you may do those things which are commanded you, say that, We are unprofitable servants; we have done that which we ought to do.
042	LUK	017	011	And it came to pass, while He was journeying to Jerusalem, and He was going through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.
042	LUK	017	012	He coming into a certain village, ten lepers met Him, who stood afar off;
042	LUK	017	013	and lifting up their voice, saying, Thou, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.
042	LUK	017	014	And seeing, He said to them, Go and show yourselves to the priest. And it came to pass while they were going, they were cleansed:
042	LUK	017	015	and one of them, seeing that he was healed, returned, with a loud voice glorifying God,
042	LUK	017	016	and he fell upon his face at His feet, giving thanks to Him: and he was a Samaritan.
042	LUK	017	017	And Jesus responding said, Were not the ten cleansed?
042	LUK	017	018	Where are the nine? And they were not found returning to give thanks to God, except this one foreigner.
042	LUK	017	019	And He said to him, having arisen, go: thy faith hath saved thee.
042	LUK	017	020	Then being interrogated by the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God is coming, He responded to them and said, The kingdom of God comes not with observation:
042	LUK	017	021	neither will they say; Lo, here! or, there! for behold, the kingdom of God is among you.
042	LUK	017	022	And He said to the disciples, The days will come, when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and will not see it.
042	LUK	017	023	And they will say to you, Lo, here! lo, there! go not away, nor follow them.
042	LUK	017	024	For as the lightning, flashing out of the one part under the heaven, gleams into the other part under heaven, so shall be the Son of man in His day.
042	LUK	017	025	But it behooves Him first to suffer many things and to be set at nought by this generation.
042	LUK	017	026	And as it was in the days of Noah, so it will be in the days of the Son of man.
042	LUK	017	027	They were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were getting married, until the day on which Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.
042	LUK	017	028	Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building;
042	LUK	017	029	and on the day on which Lot went out from Sodom, fire and brimstone rained from heaven and destroyed them all.
042	LUK	017	030	According to these things it will be in the day the Son of man is revealed.
042	LUK	017	031	In that day, let not him who is on the house, and his goods in the house, come down to take them: and likewise let not him who is in the field turn back.
042	LUK	017	032	Remember Lot's wife.
042	LUK	017	033	Whosoever may seek to save his soul shall lose it: and whosoever shall lose it shall find it.
042	LUK	017	034	I say unto you, on that night two men shall be on one bed; the one shall be taken and the other left.
042	LUK	017	035	Two women shall be grinding at the same mill; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.
042	LUK	017	037	Responding they say to Him, Where, Lord? And He said to them, Where the body is, there the eagles will also be gathered together.
042	LUK	018	001	And He spoke a parable to them that it behooves them to pray always, and not to faint;
042	LUK	018	002	saying, There was a certain judge in a certain city, fearing not God, and regarding not man.
042	LUK	018	003	And there was a widow in that city; and she continued to come to him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.
042	LUK	018	004	And he was not willing for a time: but after these things he said in himself, Though I fear not God nor regard man,
042	LUK	018	005	yet because this widow causes me trouble, I will avenge her, lest coming forever she may smite me in the face.
042	LUK	018	006	But the Lord said, I fear what the unjust judge says.
042	LUK	018	007	And shall not God avenge His elect, crying to Him day and night, and He is long-suffering over them?
042	LUK	018	008	I say unto you, that He will avenge them speedily. Moreover the Son of man having come, will He then find faith upon the earth?
042	LUK	018	009	And He spoke this parable to certain ones having confidence in themselves that they are righteous, and despising the rest.
042	LUK	018	010	Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.
042	LUK	018	011	The Pharisee standing was praying in these words, God, I thank thee because I am not like the rest of the men, extortioners, unjust, adulterous, or even as this publican:
042	LUK	018	012	I fast twice per week; I give tithes of all things so many as I possess.
042	LUK	018	013	But the publican, standing a great way off, did not wish even to lift up his eyes to the heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God, be merciful to me the sinner.
042	LUK	018	014	I say unto you, He went down to his house justified rather than the other: because every one exalting himself shall be abased; and the one humbling himself shall be exalted.
042	LUK	018	015	And they were indeed bringing the infants to Him, that He should touch them: but the disciples seeing rebuked them.
042	LUK	018	016	And Jesus calling them to Him, said, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	018	017	Truly I say unto you, whosoever may not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, can not enter into it.
042	LUK	018	018	And a certain ruler asked Him, saying, Good Teacher, having done what, shall I inherit eternal life?
042	LUK	018	019	And Jesus said to him, Why do you call me good? No one is good, except One, God.
042	LUK	018	020	You know the commandments, thou must not commit adultery, thou must not murder, thou must not steal, thou must not bear false witness, honor thy father and mother.
042	LUK	018	021	And he said, All these things have I kept from my youth.
042	LUK	018	022	And Jesus hearing these things, said to him, Still one thing is lacking to thee: Sell all things whatsoever you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.
042	LUK	018	023	And hearing these things, he went away very sorrowful; for he was exceedingly rich.
042	LUK	018	024	Jesus seeing him said, How hardly will those having riches enter into the kingdom of God!
042	LUK	018	025	For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to go into the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	018	026	And those hearing said, And who is able to be saved?
042	LUK	018	027	And He said, Those things which are impossible with men are possible with God.
042	LUK	018	028	And Peter said, Behold, we have left all things, and followed thee.
042	LUK	018	029	And He said to them, Truly I say unto you, that there is no one who has left house, or parents, or brothers, or wife, or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,
042	LUK	018	030	who may not receive a hundredfold in this time, and in the coming age eternal life.
042	LUK	018	031	And taking the twelve aside, He said to them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things which have been written by the prophets shall be perfected to the Son of man.
042	LUK	018	032	For He will be delivered to the Gentiles; and be mocked, and insulted, and spat upon:
042	LUK	018	033	and having scourged Him, they will kill Him; and He will arise the third day.
042	LUK	018	034	And they understood none of these things; and this word was hidden from them, and they did not know the things spoken.
042	LUK	018	035	And it came to pass, while He was drawing nigh to Jericho, a certain blind man was sitting by the wayside begging.
042	LUK	018	036	And hearing the multitude passing by, he inquired what it might be.
042	LUK	018	037	And they told him that Jesus the Nazarene is going along.
042	LUK	018	038	And he cried out saying, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.
042	LUK	018	039	And the passersby continued to rebuke him, that he should keep silent: but he continued to cry out much more, O thou son of David, have mercy on me.
042	LUK	018	040	And Jesus standing, commanded him to be led to Him; and he drawing nigh, He asked him,
042	LUK	018	041	What do you wish that I shall do to you? And he said, Lord, that I may look up.
042	LUK	018	042	And Jesus said to him, Look up: thy faith hath saved thee.
042	LUK	018	043	And immediately he looked up, and followed Him, glorifying God: and all the people, seeing, gave praise to God.
042	LUK	019	001	And having come in He passed through Jericho.
042	LUK	019	002	And behold, a certain man by name called Zaccheus; and he was chief of the publicans, and he was rich.
042	LUK	019	003	And he was seeking to see Jesus, who He is; and was not able on account of the multitude, because he was small in stature.
042	LUK	019	004	And having run forward in advance, he went up in a sycamore-tree in order that he might see Him: because He was about to pass that way.
042	LUK	019	005	And when He came to the place, Jesus looking up, saw him, and said to him, Zaccheus, hastening, come down; for it behooveth me to abide in thy house this day.
042	LUK	019	006	And hastening, he came down, and received Him rejoicing.
042	LUK	019	007	And all seeing, murmured, saying, that He is come in to abide with a sinner man.
042	LUK	019	008	And Zaccheus standing, said to the Lord, Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any one fraudulently, I restore fourfold.
042	LUK	019	009	And Jesus said to him, This day salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham;
042	LUK	019	010	for the Son of man came to seek and to save that which is lost.
042	LUK	019	011	And they hearing these things, proceeding, He spoke a parable, because he is nigh unto Jerusalem, and they think the kingdom of God is about to be made manifest immediately.
042	LUK	019	012	Then He said, A certain nobleman went to a far country, to receive for himself a kingdom, and return.
042	LUK	019	013	And calling his ten servants, he gave to them ten pounds, and said to them, Operate till I come.
042	LUK	019	014	But his citizens continued to hate him, and sent an embassy after him, saying, We do not wish this man to rule over us.
042	LUK	019	015	And it came to pass, when he returned, having received the kingdom, and he said, that those servants should be called, to whom he had given the money, in order that he might know what each one had gained by their merchandise.
042	LUK	019	016	And the first came, saying, Lord, thy pound has gained ten pounds.
042	LUK	019	017	And he said to him, Well done, thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in the least, have thou authority over ten cities.
042	LUK	019	018	And the second one came, saying, Lord, thy pound has gained five pounds.
042	LUK	019	019	And he also said to him, Be thou over five cities.
042	LUK	019	020	And the other one came, saying, Lord, behold, thy pound, which I had laid away in a napkin:
042	LUK	019	021	for I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that which thou hadst not laid down, and thou reapest that which thou hast not sown.
042	LUK	019	022	And he says to him, Out of thine own mouth I will judge thee, thou wicked servant. Didst thou know that I am an austere man, taking up what I have not laid down, and reaping what I have not sown?
042	LUK	019	023	Wherefore indeed didst thou not put my money in the bank? and having come I would have received the same with the product.
042	LUK	019	024	And he said to the bystanders, Take the pound from him, and give it to the one having ten pounds.
042	LUK	019	025	And they said to him, Lord, he has ten pounds.
042	LUK	019	026	I say unto you, that to every one having it shall be given; and from every one not having, it shall be taken away even that which he hath.
042	LUK	019	027	Moreover bring these my enemies, not wishing me to rule over them, hither, and slay them before me.
042	LUK	019	028	And speaking these things, He was journeying before them, going up to Jerusalem.
042	LUK	019	029	And it came to pass, when He drew nigh unto Bethphage and Bethany, to the mount called the Mount of Olives, and He sent away two of His disciples,
042	LUK	019	030	saying, Go into the village over against you; in which entering you will find a colt tied, on which no one of men ever sat: loosing, lead him hither.
042	LUK	019	031	And if any one may ask you, Why do you loose him? thus say to him, that the Lord hath need of him:
042	LUK	019	032	and those having been sent, departing, found as Jesus told them.
042	LUK	019	033	And they loosing the donkey, his master said to them, Why do you loose the donkey?
042	LUK	019	034	And they said, The Lord hath need of him.
042	LUK	019	035	And they led him to Jesus: and casting their garments on the colt, they mounted Jesus on them.
042	LUK	019	036	And He going forward, they were strewing their garments in the road.
042	LUK	019	037	And He already drawing nigh to the descension of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to praise God with a loud voice for all those miracles which they saw; shouting,
042	LUK	019	038	saying, Blessed is the King coming in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.
042	LUK	019	039	And certain ones of the Pharisees from the multitude said to Him, Teacher, rebuke thy disciples:
042	LUK	019	040	and He responding said to them, I say unto you, that if these may keep silent, the rocks will cry out.
042	LUK	019	041	And when He drew near, seeing the city He wept over it,
042	LUK	019	042	saying, If thou indeed hadst known, truly in this thy day, the things appertaining to thy peace! but now they are hidden from thy eyes.
042	LUK	019	043	Because the days will come upon thee, and thine enemies will cast a fortification about thee, and surround thee, and press in on thee from all directions,
042	LUK	019	044	and will slay thee, and thy children in thee; and will leave in thee not a stone upon a stone; because thou hast not known the time of thy visitation.
042	LUK	019	045	And having come into the temple, He began to cast out those buying and selling,
042	LUK	019	046	saying to them; It has been written, My house shall be a house of prayer: but you have made it a den of thieves.
042	LUK	019	047	And He was teaching daily in the temple, and the chief priests and scribes and the first men of the people were seeking to destroy Him.
042	LUK	019	048	And they were not finding what they might do; for all the people hung on Him, hearing Him.
042	LUK	020	001	And it came to pass, on one of those days, He teaching the people in the temple, and preaching the gospel, the priests, and scribes, along with the elders stood up against Him;
042	LUK	020	002	and they spoke to Him, saying, Tell us by what authority you are doing these things? Who is the one having given you this authority?
042	LUK	020	003	And responding He said to them, I will ask you one word; and you tell me:
042	LUK	020	004	Was the baptism of John from heaven, or from men?
042	LUK	020	005	And they reason among themselves saying, If we may say it is from heaven; He will say, Why did you not believe on him?
042	LUK	020	006	And if we may say, From men; all the people will stone us: for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.
042	LUK	020	007	And they responded, We do not know whence it is.
042	LUK	020	008	And Jesus said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.
042	LUK	020	009	And He began to speak to the people this parable, A man planted a vineyard and gave it out to husbandmen, and went away a long time.
042	LUK	020	010	And in season he sent a servant to the husbandmen that they might give to him of the fruit of the vineyard, and the husbandmen beating him, sent him away empty.
042	LUK	020	011	And he proceeded to send to them another servant, and they beating and dishonoring him sent him away empty.
042	LUK	020	012	And he proceeded to send a third: and wounding him, they cast him out also.
042	LUK	020	013	And the lord of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my own beloved son: perchance seeing, they will reverence him.
042	LUK	020	014	And the husbandmen, seeing him, reasoned among themselves saying, This is the heir; let us kill him, in order that the inheritance may be ours.
042	LUK	020	015	And casting him out from the vineyard they slew him; what then will the lord of the vineyard do?
042	LUK	020	016	He will come and destroy those husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others. And hearing, they said, Let it not be so.
042	LUK	020	017	And looking upon them, He said, What is that which has been written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same has come to be the head of the corner.
042	LUK	020	018	Every one having fallen on that stone will be dashed to pieces; and on whomsoever it may fall, it will grind him to powder.
042	LUK	020	019	And the chief priests and scribes sought to lay hands on Him at this hour, and feared the people; for they knew that He spoke this parable against them.
042	LUK	020	020	And laying in wait for Him, they sent sharpers, feigning themselves to be righteous, that they might catch his word, in order to turn Him over to the government and authority of the proconsul.
042	LUK	020	021	They asked Him saying, Teacher, we know that thou dost speak and teach correctly; and thou dost not receive the face; but thou dost teach the way of God in truth:
042	LUK	020	022	is it lawful for us give tribute to Caesar, or not?
042	LUK	020	023	And He knowing their rascality, said to them, Why tempt ye me?
042	LUK	020	024	Show me the denarion. Whose image and superscription has it? And they responding said, Caesar's.
042	LUK	020	025	And He said to them, Therefore render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things which are God's.
042	LUK	020	026	And they were not able to criticise His word before the people: and being astonished at His answer, they were silent.
042	LUK	020	027	And certain ones of the Sadducees, who deny that there is a resurrection, coming forward asked Him,
042	LUK	020	028	saying, Teacher, Moses wrote to us, That if the brother of any one may die having a wife, and the same may die childless, that his brother must take his wife and raise up seed to his brother.
042	LUK	020	029	Then there were seven brothers; and the first receiving a wife died childless.
042	LUK	020	030	And the second
042	LUK	020	031	and the third received her, and likewise also the seven; they left no children and died.
042	LUK	020	032	Last of all the woman also died.
042	LUK	020	033	Therefore in the resurrection of which one of them is she the wife? for the seven had her a wife.
042	LUK	020	034	And responding Jesus said to them, The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage,
042	LUK	020	035	but those counted worthy to attain that age and the resurrection, which is from the dead,
042	LUK	020	036	neither marry nor are given in marriage; for they are not able yet to die; for they are like the angels, and sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.
042	LUK	020	037	But that the dead are raised, Moses also mentioned at the Bush, when he says; The Lord, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
042	LUK	020	038	He is not the God of the dead but of the living; for all live unto Him.
042	LUK	020	039	And certain of the scribes responding said; Teacher, you spoke beautifully.
042	LUK	020	040	And they no longer dared to ask Him anything.
042	LUK	020	041	And He said to them; How do they say that the Christ is the son of David?
042	LUK	020	042	And David himself says in the Book of the Psalms, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,
042	LUK	020	043	until I may make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet.
042	LUK	020	044	Therefore David calls Him Lord, and how is He his son?
042	LUK	020	045	And all the people hearing, He said to His disciples,
042	LUK	020	046	Beware of the scribes, wishing to walk about in robes, and loving salutations in the forums, and the first seats in the synagogues, and the first couches at the suppers,
042	LUK	020	047	Who devour the houses of the widows, and pray long through pretext; they shall receive the greater judgment.
042	LUK	021	001	And looking up, He saw the rich casting their gifts into the treasury.
042	LUK	021	002	And He also saw a certain poor widow, casting in thither two mites.
042	LUK	021	003	And He said; Truly I say unto you, That this poor widow cast in more than all.
042	LUK	021	004	For they all of that which abounds unto them cast into the gifts of God: but she out of her scarcity cast in all her living which she had.
042	LUK	021	005	And certain ones speaking concerning the temple, that it was ornamented with beautiful stones and offerings, He said,
042	LUK	021	006	These things which you see, the days will come, in which stone will not be left upon stone, which shall not be thrown down.
042	LUK	021	007	And they asked Him, saying, Teacher, when then shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when these things may be about to come to pass?
042	LUK	021	008	And He said, See that you are not deceived. For many will come in my name, saying, I am He; and The time is at hand: go ye not after them.
042	LUK	021	009	And when ye may hear of wars and commotions, be not affrighted: for it behooveth these things first to take place; but the end is not immediately.
042	LUK	021	010	Then He said to them, Nation shall rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:
042	LUK	021	011	and there shall be great earthquakes, famines and pestilences in divers places; and there shall be great terrors and signs from heaven.
042	LUK	021	012	And before all of these things, they will lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you into their synagogues and prisons, led before kings and governors on account of my name.
042	LUK	021	013	And it shall come to pass to you for a testimony.
042	LUK	021	014	Place it in your hearts, not to premeditate your defense:
042	LUK	021	015	for I will give to you mouth and wisdom, which all who are opposed to you will not be able to gainsay nor resist.
042	LUK	021	016	And you shall be delivered up also by your parents, and brothers, and relatives, and friends; and they will kill some of you.
042	LUK	021	017	And you shall be hated by all, on account of my name:
042	LUK	021	018	and not a hair from your head shall perish.
042	LUK	021	019	In your patience gain your souls.
042	LUK	021	020	And when you may see Jerusalem shut up by the armies, then know that her desolation is nigh.
042	LUK	021	021	Then let those in Judea fly to the mountains; and let those in the midst of it depart out; and let not those in the country come into it.
042	LUK	021	022	Because these are the days of vengeance, to fill up all things which have been written.
042	LUK	021	023	But alas to those in gestation and nursing in those days! For there shall be great distress upon the earth, and wrath to this people.
042	LUK	021	024	And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and be led captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles may be fulfilled.
042	LUK	021	025	And there will be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars; and commotion of the nations of the earth in their perplexity, the sea and the wave roaring;
042	LUK	021	026	the souls of men failing from fear, and expectation of those things coming upon the world: for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
042	LUK	021	027	And then they will see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
042	LUK	021	028	And these things beginning to take place, straighten up, and lift up your heads; because your redemption is nigh.
042	LUK	021	029	And He spoke a parable to them: Behold the fig-tree, and all the trees:
042	LUK	021	030	when they may already put forth, seeing, know for yourselves that summer is nigh.
042	LUK	021	031	So you also, when you see these things take place, know that the kingdom of God is nigh.
042	LUK	021	032	Truly I say unto you, that this race may not pass away, until all these things shall be fulfilled.
042	LUK	021	033	But heaven and earth shall pass away, but my word can not pass away.
042	LUK	021	034	But take heed to yourselves, lest your hearts may be burdened with luxury, and drunkenness, and worldly cares, and that day may come on you unanticipated.
042	LUK	021	035	For as a lasso it will come upon all the people who are sitting down upon the face of the whole earth.
042	LUK	021	036	Therefore watch, praying all the time, that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things which are about to come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.
042	LUK	021	037	And He was teaching in the temple during the days; and during the nights going out, He was lodging in the mountain called Mount of Olives.
042	LUK	021	038	And all the people gathered in the temple to hear Him.
042	LUK	022	001	And the feast of the unleavened bread, called the passover, was nigh.
042	LUK	022	002	And the chief priests and scribes were seeking how they might kill Him; for they feared the people.
042	LUK	022	003	And Satan entered into Judas called Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.
042	LUK	022	004	And having gone away, he spoke with the chief priests and the magistrates, how he might betray Him to them.
042	LUK	022	005	And they rejoiced, and promised to give him money.
042	LUK	022	006	And he promised them, and was seeking an opportunity to deliver Him unto them in the absence of the multitude.
042	LUK	022	007	And the day of the unleavened bread came, in which it behooved to slay the passover.
042	LUK	022	008	And He sent Peter and John, saying, Going prepare for us the passover, in order that we may eat it.
042	LUK	022	009	And they said to Him, Where do you wish that we may prepare it?
042	LUK	022	010	And He said to them, Behold, you having come into the city, a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he is going.
042	LUK	022	011	And say to the landlord, The Teacher says to thee, Where is the guest-chamber, where I may eat the passover with my disciples?
042	LUK	022	012	And he will show you a large upper room furnished: there prepare.
042	LUK	022	013	And having gone away, they found as He told them; and prepared the passover.
042	LUK	022	014	And when the hour arrived, He sat down and the apostles along with Him.
042	LUK	022	015	And He said to them, I desired with desire to eat this passover with you before I suffer: for I say to you,
042	LUK	022	016	I eat this no more, until it may be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	022	017	And receiving the cup, having given thanks, He said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves;
042	LUK	022	018	for I say to you, I shall from now drink no more from the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God may come.
042	LUK	022	019	And taking bread, blessing it, He broke it, and gave it to them, saying, This is my body given for you: do this in remembrance of me.
042	LUK	022	020	Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out in your behalf.
042	LUK	022	021	Moreover behold, the hand of the one betraying me is with me at the table.
042	LUK	022	022	Indeed the Son of man goes, according to that which has been appointed: but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed!
042	LUK	022	023	And they began to inquire among themselves, who then of them is the one of them about to do this.
042	LUK	022	024	And there was a contention among them, which one of them seems to be the greater,
042	LUK	022	025	And He said to them, The kings of the Gentiles domineer over them; and those exercising authority over them are called Benefactors.
042	LUK	022	026	But you are not thus: but let the greater among you be as the younger; and the leader as the waiter.
042	LUK	022	027	For which is the greater, he that sitteth at the table, or the waiter? is not the one sitting? but I am in the midst of you as the waiter.
042	LUK	022	028	But you are those who have remained with me in my temptations.
042	LUK	022	029	And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father appointed unto me,
042	LUK	022	030	in order that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom; and you shall sit upon thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
042	LUK	022	031	Simon, Simon, behold, Satan sought you out, to sift you as wheat:
042	LUK	022	032	but I prayed for you, that your faith may not fail you: and thou, when having turned, strengthen thy brethren:
042	LUK	022	033	but he said to Him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee to prison and to death.
042	LUK	022	034	And He said; I say unto thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.
042	LUK	022	035	Then He said to them, When I sent you without purse, and valise, and sandals, did you lack anything? And they said; Nothing.
042	LUK	022	036	And He said to them; But now, let the one having a purse, take it, likewise also valise: and let the one having no sword, sell his cloak and buy one.
042	LUK	022	037	For I say unto you, that it behooves that which has been written to be perfected in me, this, And He was numbered with the transgressors: for indeed that which is concerning me has an end.
042	LUK	022	038	And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And He said to them, It is sufficient.
042	LUK	022	039	And having gone out, He departed, according to custom, into the Mount of Olives; and His disciples followed Him.
042	LUK	022	040	He being at the place, He said to them, Pray that you enter not into temptation.
042	LUK	022	041	And He was separated from them about a stone's cast; and putting down His knees, continued to pray,
042	LUK	022	042	saying, Father, if this cup is willing to pass from me; moreover let not my will, but thine be done.
042	LUK	022	043	And an angel from heaven appeared unto Him, strengthening Him.
042	LUK	022	044	And being in agony He continued to pray the more earnestly. And His sweat was like drops of blood falling down upon the ground.
042	LUK	022	045	And having risen from prayer, having come to His disciples, He found them sleeping on account of weariness,
042	LUK	022	046	and He said to them, Why do you sleep? Arising pray, that you may not enter into temptation.
042	LUK	022	047	And He still speaking, behold, a multitude and the one called Judas, one of the twelve, was coming before them; and he drew near to Jesus to kiss Him.
042	LUK	022	048	And Jesus said to him, Judas, do you betray the Son of man with a kiss?
042	LUK	022	049	And those around Him seeing what was coming on Him, said, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?
042	LUK	022	050	And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.
042	LUK	022	051	And Jesus responding said, Hold on until this: and touching his ear, healed him.
042	LUK	022	052	Jesus said to the high priests, and magistrates of the temple, and elders who were assembled to Him; You have come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs.
042	LUK	022	053	I being daily with you in the temple, you reached not out your hands unto me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.
042	LUK	022	054	And taking Him, they led Him away, and led Him into the house of the chief priest. And Peter followed Him a long way off.
042	LUK	022	055	And having lighted a fire in the midst of the court, and they sitting together, Peter was sitting in the midst of them.
042	LUK	022	056	And a certain maidservant, seeing him sitting at the fire, and fixing her eyes on him, said, This man was with Him.
042	LUK	022	057	And he denied Him, saying, Woman, I know Him not.
042	LUK	022	058	And after a brief interval another seeing him, said, Truly, thou art one of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.
042	LUK	022	059	And about one hour having elapsed, a certain other man accosted him, saying, He was truly with Him: for he is a Galilean.
042	LUK	022	060	And Peter said, Man, I know Him not. And immediately, he yet speaking, the cock crew.
042	LUK	022	061	And the Lord turning, looked upon Peter; and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He said to him, that, Before the cock shall crow thou shalt deny me thrice.
042	LUK	022	062	And having gone out, he wept bitterly.
042	LUK	022	063	And the men having Him, began to mock, beating Him,
042	LUK	022	064	and covering Him, they continued to ask saying, Prophesy, who is the one smiting thee.
042	LUK	022	065	And blaspheming, they continued to speak many other things against Him.
042	LUK	022	066	And when it was day, the eldership of the people was convened, and the chief priests and scribes, and they led Him into their sanhedrim.
042	LUK	022	067	Saying, If thou art the Christ, tell us. And He said to them, If I may tell you, you will not believe:
042	LUK	022	068	and if indeed I will ask you, you will not respond to me, or release me.
042	LUK	022	069	And from now the Son of man shall be sitting on the right hand of the power of God.
042	LUK	022	070	And all said, Art thou the Son of God? And He said to them, You say that I am.
042	LUK	022	071	And they said, Why have we yet need of testimony? for we heard from His own mouth.
042	LUK	023	001	And all the multitude of them rising up, lead Him to Pilate.
042	LUK	023	002	And they began to accuse Him, saying, We found Him perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that He is Christ, a King.
042	LUK	023	003	And Pilate asked Him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And responding to him, He said, Thou sayest it.
042	LUK	023	004	And Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, I find nothing criminal in this man.
042	LUK	023	005	And they became stronger and stronger, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee unto this place.
042	LUK	023	006	And Pilate hearing, asked if He is a Galilean man.
042	LUK	023	007	And learning that He is from the jurisdiction of Herod, he sent Him up to Herod, being himself in Jerusalem in those days.
042	LUK	023	008	And Herod seeing Jesus, rejoiced exceedingly: for from a long time, wishing to see Him, because He was hearing about Him; and he was hoping to see some miracle wrought by Him.
042	LUK	023	009	And he asked Him with many words; and He responded to him nothing.
042	LUK	023	010	But the high priest and scribes stood by, accusing Him vehemently.
042	LUK	023	011	But Herod along with his soldiers having indeed treated Him with contempt, and mocked Him, putting on Him a scarlet robe, sent Him back to Pilate.
042	LUK	023	012	And both Herod and Pilate on that day became friends with one another: for they were hitherto in enmity either to other.
042	LUK	023	013	Pilate having called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,
042	LUK	023	014	said to them, You have brought to me this man, as revolutionizing the people: and behold, I, judging Him before you, found nothing in this man criminal of those things which you accuse against Him.
042	LUK	023	015	But Herod did not: for he sent Him back to us; and behold, nothing worthy of death has been done by Him.
042	LUK	023	016	Therefore having scourged Him, I will release Him.
042	LUK	023	018	And they unanimously cried out, saying, Take Him away, and release unto us Barabbas:
042	LUK	023	019	who had been cast into prison on account of certain sedition made in the city, and murder.
042	LUK	023	020	Then Pilate again called to them, wishing to release Jesus.
042	LUK	023	021	And they continued to shout aloud, saying, Crucify Him, crucify Him.
042	LUK	023	022	And he spoke to them the third time, For what evil hath He done? I found nothing in Him worthy of death: therefore having scourged Him, I will release Him.
042	LUK	023	023	And they continued to lay on with great voices, demanding that He should be crucified: and the voices of them and the high priests continued to grow stronger.
042	LUK	023	024	And Pilate decided that their request should be granted.
042	LUK	023	025	And released him who on account of sedition and murder had been cast into prison, and delivered up Jesus according to their wish.
042	LUK	023	026	And when they were leading Him away, taking a certain Simon, a Cyrenean, coming from the country, they placed the cross on him, to carry it after Jesus.
042	LUK	023	027	And a great multitude of people followed Him, and of women who were both weeping and bewailing Him.
042	LUK	023	028	And Jesus turning to them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and your children.
042	LUK	023	029	Because behold, the days are coming, in which they will say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that did not bring forth, and the breasts that did not nurse.
042	LUK	023	030	Then they will begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Hide us.
042	LUK	023	031	Because if they do these things in the green tree, what may be done in the dry?
042	LUK	023	032	And two malefactors were also led away with Him, to be executed.
042	LUK	023	033	And when they came to the place called Calvary. There they crucified Him, and the malefactors, one on the right and one on the left.
042	LUK	023	034	And Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they are doing. And dividing His garments, they were casting the lots.
042	LUK	023	035	The people stood looking: and the rulers were even mocking with themselves, saying, He saved others; let Him save Himself, if He is the Christ, the elect of God.
042	LUK	023	036	And the soldiers were also mocking, coming and bringing the vinegar to Him,
042	LUK	023	037	and saying, If thou art the King of the Jews, save thyself.
042	LUK	023	038	And the superscription was also over Him: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
042	LUK	023	039	And one of the malefactors having been hung up, continued to blaspheme Him, saying, If thou art the Christ, save thyself and us.
042	LUK	023	040	But the other one responding, rebuked him saying, Do you not fear God, because you are in the same condemnation?
042	LUK	023	041	and we indeed justly; for we are receiving the deservings of the things we did: but this one has done nothing amiss.
042	LUK	023	042	And he said to Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou mayest come in thy kingdom.
042	LUK	023	043	And Jesus said to him, Truly I say unto thee, This day shalt thou be with me in Paradise.
042	LUK	023	044	And it was about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.
042	LUK	023	045	And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the middle.
042	LUK	023	046	And calling with a loud voice, Jesus said, Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit. And having said this, He expired.
042	LUK	023	047	And the centurion seeing that which took place, glorified God, saying, Surely this was a righteous man.
042	LUK	023	048	And all the multitudes being present at that scene, seeing those things which took place, were going away beating their breasts.
042	LUK	023	049	And all His acquaintances stood a great way off and the women who having followed along with Him from Galilee, seeing these things.
042	LUK	023	050	And behold, there was a man by name Joseph, being a councilor, a good and righteous man,
042	LUK	023	051	(for he was not consenting unto their counsel and deed), from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who also himself was looking for the kingdom of God.
042	LUK	023	052	He having come to Pilate, begged the body of Jesus.
042	LUK	023	053	And having taken it down, he wrapped it in linen, and placed it in a hewn sepulcher, where no one ever was laid.
042	LUK	023	054	And it was Preparation day, and the Sabbath was drawing nigh.
042	LUK	023	055	And the women, who had come along with him out of Galilee, having followed down, saw the sepulcher, and where His body was placed.
042	LUK	023	056	And having returned, they prepared aromatics and myrrh: and they kept the Sabbath according to the commandment.
042	LUK	024	001	And on the first of the Sabbath, at the depth of the dawn, they came to the sepulcher, bearing the aromatics which they had prepared,
042	LUK	024	002	And they found the stone, having been rolled away from the sepulcher.
042	LUK	024	003	And coming in they found not the body of the Lord Jesus.
042	LUK	024	004	And it came to pass, while they were at a loss concerning this, and behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:
042	LUK	024	005	and they being afraid, and turning their face towards the ground, they said to them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?
042	LUK	024	006	He is not here, but He is risen. Remember how He spoke to you, being with you in Galilee,
042	LUK	024	007	Saying That it behooveth the Son of man to be delivered into the hands of sinners, and to be crucified, and to rise again on the third day.
042	LUK	024	008	And they remembered His words.
042	LUK	024	009	And having returned from the sepulcher, they proclaimed all these things to the eleven, and all the rest.
042	LUK	024	010	And Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James: and the other women with them spoke these things to the apostles.
042	LUK	024	011	And their words appeared before them like a dream; and they doubted them.
042	LUK	024	013	And behold, two of them on that day were journeying to a village, distant from Jerusalem sixty furlongs, to which was the name Emmaus:
042	LUK	024	014	and they were conversing with one another concerning all those things which had transpired.
042	LUK	024	015	And it came to pass, while they are talking and making inquiry, Jesus Himself also having come nigh, journeyed along with them:
042	LUK	024	016	and their eyes were held so as not to recognize Him.
042	LUK	024	017	And He said to them, What speeches are these which you are interchanging to one another, walking along? And they stood still, looking sad.
042	LUK	024	018	And one, whose name was Cleopas, said to Him, Dost thou only sojourn at Jerusalem and not know the things which have taken place in it in these days?
042	LUK	024	019	And He said to them, What? And they said to Him, The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet-man mighty in work and word before God and all the people.
042	LUK	024	020	How the chief priests and our rulers indeed delivered Him up to the condemnation of death, and they crucified Him.
042	LUK	024	021	But we were hoping that He is the one about to redeem Israel: but truly in addition to all these things, this is the third day from which these things took place.
042	LUK	024	022	But certain women from us truly surprised us, being early at the sepulcher;
042	LUK	024	023	and not seeing His body, came, saying, they had also seen a vision of angels, who say that He is alive.
042	LUK	024	024	And certain ones of those with us went away to the sepulcher, and found as the women also said: and they saw Him not.
042	LUK	024	025	And He said to them, O ye foolish, and slow in heart to believe in all those things which the prophet spoke!
042	LUK	024	026	Did it not behoove Christ to suffer, and to enter into His glory?
042	LUK	024	027	And beginning from Moses and all the prophets, He expounded to them in all the Scriptures, the things concerning Himself.
042	LUK	024	028	And they drew nigh to the village, whither they were going: and He made as though He would go further:
042	LUK	024	029	and they constrained Him, saying, Abide with us: because it is at the evening, and the day has already declined. And He came in to abide with them.
042	LUK	024	030	And it came to pass, while He was reclining with them at the table, taking bread, He blessed it, and breaking it, He gave it to them:
042	LUK	024	031	and their eyes were opened, and they recognized Him; and He vanished from them.
042	LUK	024	032	And they said to one another, Did not our heart bum within us, while He was talking to us on the way, as He was expounding the Scriptures to us?
042	LUK	024	033	And rising up the same hour, they returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven and those with them gathered together,
042	LUK	024	034	saying, The Lord indeed is risen, and was seen by Simon.
042	LUK	024	035	And they expounded those things on the way, and bow He was made known to them in the breaking of the bread.
042	LUK	024	036	And they speaking these things, He stood in their midst,
042	LUK	024	037	and they being affrighted and filled with fear, thought they saw a spirit.
042	LUK	024	038	And He said to them, Why are you excited, and why do reasonings arise in your heart?
042	LUK	024	039	See my hands and my feet, that I am He: feel me; and see, because a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see me having.
042	LUK	024	041	And they still disbelieving from joy, and wondering, He said to them, Have you here any edible?
042	LUK	024	042	And they gave Him a piece of baked fish:
042	LUK	024	043	and taking it, He did eat in their presence.
042	LUK	024	044	And He said to them, These are my words which I spoke to you, being still with you, that it behooves all things which have been written concerning me in the law of Moses, and the prophets, and the Psalms, to be fulfilled.
042	LUK	024	045	Then He opened their mind, that they might understand the Scriptures.
042	LUK	024	046	And He said to them, As it has been written, That Christ must suffer, and rise from the dead on the third day;
042	LUK	024	047	and repentance unto remission of sins is to be preached in His name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.
042	LUK	024	048	You are witnesses of these things.
042	LUK	024	049	And I send the promise of the Father upon you: and you tarry in the city, until you may be endued with power from on high.
042	LUK	024	050	And He led them out even unto Bethany; and having lifted up His hands, He blessed them.
042	LUK	024	051	And it came to pass, while He was blessing them, He departed from them, and was carried up into heaven.
042	LUK	024	052	And they returned to Jerusalem with great joy:
042	LUK	024	053	and were constantly in the temple, praising God.

# BOOK	043	JOH	John	John
043	JOH	001	001	In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
043	JOH	001	002	The same was in the beginning with God.
043	JOH	001	003	All things were made by Him, and without Him nothing was made, that has been made.
043	JOH	001	004	In Him was life, and the life was the light of the men.
043	JOH	001	005	And the light shineth in the darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not.
043	JOH	001	006	There was a man having been sent from God, whose name was John;
043	JOH	001	007	The same came for a witness, that he might bear witness concerning the light, in order that all through him might believe.
043	JOH	001	008	He was not the light, but came that he might bear witness concerning the light.
043	JOH	001	009	That was the true light, which lighteth every man, coming into the world.
043	JOH	001	010	He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew Him not.
043	JOH	001	011	He came unto His own, and His own received Him not.
043	JOH	001	012	But so many as received Him, to them gave He the right to become the children of God, to those believing on His name:
043	JOH	001	013	who were born not of bloods, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
043	JOH	001	014	The Word was made flesh, and tented among us (and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten with the Father), full of grace and truth.
043	JOH	001	015	John beareth witness concerning Him, and cried out saying; This is He of whom I spoke, He that cometh after me has been before me:
043	JOH	001	016	because He was my Creator. And of His fullness we all received grace upon grace.
043	JOH	001	017	Because the law was given by Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.
043	JOH	001	018	No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, the one being in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared him.
043	JOH	001	019	This is the testimony of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem, that they might ask him,
043	JOH	001	020	Who art thou? and he confessed and denied not, and confessed that, I am not the Christ.
043	JOH	001	021	They asked him, What then? Art thou Elijah? And he says, I am not. Art thou that prophet?
043	JOH	001	022	And he responded, No. Then they said to him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to those having sent us. What do you say concerning yourself?
043	JOH	001	023	I am the voice of one roaring in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord as Isaiah the prophet said.
043	JOH	001	024	And those having been sent were of the Pharisees.
043	JOH	001	025	And they asked him, and said to him, Then why do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor that prophet?
043	JOH	001	026	John responded to them, saying, I baptize with water: There standeth One in your midst whom you do not know,
043	JOH	001	027	the One coming after me, of whom I am not worthy that I may loose the latchet of His sandal.
043	JOH	001	028	These things took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
043	JOH	001	029	On the following day he sees Jesus coming to him, and says, Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world.
043	JOH	001	030	This is He concerning whom I spoke, A man cometh after me who has been before me: because he was my Creator.
043	JOH	001	031	And I did not know Him, but in order that He may be made manifest to Israel, on this account I came baptizing with water.
043	JOH	001	032	And John testified saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and remained on Him.
043	JOH	001	033	And I did not know Him, but the One having sent me to baptize with water, He said to me, On whom you may see the Spirit descending and remaining on Him, He is the one baptizing with the Holy Ghost.
043	JOH	001	034	And I have seen, and testified that He is the Son of God.
043	JOH	001	035	On the following day John again stood, and two of his disciples,
043	JOH	001	036	and looking upon Jesus walking about, says, Behold, the Lamb of God.
043	JOH	001	037	And the two disciples heard him speaking and followed Jesus.
043	JOH	001	038	Jesus turning and seeing them following, says to them, What are you seeking? and they said to Him, Doctor, (which is said, being interpreted, Teacher), where dwellest thou?
043	JOH	001	039	He says to them; Come and see. Then they came and saw where He dwelleth, and they abode with Him that day: it was about the tenth hour.
043	JOH	001	040	Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two hearing from John, and follows Him;
043	JOH	001	041	he first finds his own brother Simon, and says to him, We have found Messiah, which is being interpreted, Christ.
043	JOH	001	042	He led him to Jesus. Jesus looking upon him said; Thou art Simon the Son of Jonah, thou shalt be called Cephas (which is interpreted, Peter).
043	JOH	001	043	On the following day he wished to depart into Galilee, and he finds Philip. And Jesus says to him; Follow me.
043	JOH	001	044	Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.
043	JOH	001	045	Philip finds Nathanael and says to him, We have found Him, of whom Moses and the prophets, in the law, did write, Jesus the son of Joseph, who is from Nazareth.
043	JOH	001	046	Nathanael said to him, Is any good thing able to come out of Nazareth? Philip says to him, Come and see.
043	JOH	001	047	Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him, and says concerning him, Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no guile.
043	JOH	001	048	Nathanael says to Him, Whence do you know me? Jesus responded and said to him, Before Philip called you, I saw you, being under the fig-tree.
043	JOH	001	049	Nathanael responded, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, the King of Israel.
043	JOH	001	050	Jesus responded and said to him, Because I said to thee, that I saw thee under the fig-tree, dost thou believe? thou shalt see greater things than these.
043	JOH	001	051	And He says to him, Truly, truly, I say unto you, you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.
043	JOH	002	001	On the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:
043	JOH	002	002	and Jesus and His disciples were invited to the marriage.
043	JOH	002	003	And they had no wine, because the wine of the marriage was exhausted. Then the mother of Jesus says to Him, There is no wine.
043	JOH	002	004	And Jesus says to her, What is that to me and to thee? O woman, my hour is not yet come.
043	JOH	002	005	His mother says to the servants, Do whatsoever He may say to you.
043	JOH	002	006	And there were six waterpots of stone sitting there according to the purification of the Jews, containing about two or three firkins. Jesus says to them,
043	JOH	002	007	Fill the waterpots with water. They filled them to the brim.
043	JOH	002	008	And He says to them, Now draw out and carry to the chief ruler of the feast,
043	JOH	002	009	and they brought it to him. And when the ruler of the feast tasted the water, having been made wine, and did not know whence it is (but the servants having drawn the water knew), the ruler calls the groom,
043	JOH	002	010	and says to him, Every man first sets forth the good wine; and when they have drunk freely, the inferior: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.
043	JOH	002	011	Jesus did this, the beginning of miracles, in Cana of Galilee, and manifested His glory; and His disciples believed on Him.
043	JOH	002	012	After this He and His mother, and His brothers and His disciples went down into Capernaum, and abode there not many days.
043	JOH	002	013	And the passover of the Jews were nigh, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
043	JOH	002	014	And He found in the temple those selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the money-changers sitting:
043	JOH	002	015	and having made a scourge of cords, He cast all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen, and poured out the money of the exchangers, and over-turned the tables.
043	JOH	002	016	And He said to those selling doves; Take these things hence, make not the house of my Father a house of merchandise.
043	JOH	002	017	And His disciples remembered that it is written, The zeal of thy house doth eat me up.
043	JOH	002	018	Then the Jews responded and said to Him, What sign do you show us, because you do these things?
043	JOH	002	019	Jesus responded and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will rear it up.
043	JOH	002	020	Then the Jews said, Forty and six years was this temple being built, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?
043	JOH	002	021	But He spoke concerning the temple of His body.
043	JOH	002	022	Then when He arose from the dead, His disciples remembered that He said these things, and believed the Scripture and words which Jesus spoke.
043	JOH	002	023	And when He was in Jerusalem at the feast, during the passover, many believed on His name, seeing His miracles which He was doing;
043	JOH	002	024	and Jesus did not intrust Himself to them because He knows all men,
043	JOH	002	025	and because He had no need that any one should witness concerning man; because He was knowing what was in man.
043	JOH	003	001	There was a man of the Pharisees, the name to him Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews;
043	JOH	003	002	the same came to Him by night, and said to Him, Rabbi, we know that thou hast come a teacher from God; for no one is able to do these miracles, which thou art doing, unless God may he with him.
043	JOH	003	003	Jesus responded and said to him, Truly, truly, I say unto thee, unless any one may be born from above, he is not able to see the kingdom of God.
043	JOH	003	004	Nicodemus says to him; How is a man able to be born, being old? whether he is able to enter the second time into the womb of his mother, and be born?
043	JOH	003	005	Jesus responded, Truly, truly, I say unto thee, Unless any one may be born of water and Spirit, he is not able to enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
043	JOH	003	006	That which has been born of the flesh is flesh; and that which has been born of the Spirit is spirit.
043	JOH	003	007	Be not astonished because I said to thee; It behooveth you to be born from above.
043	JOH	003	008	The Spirit breathes on whom He willeth, and thou hearest His voice, but dost not know whence He cometh and whither He goeth; so is every one who has been born of the Spirit.
043	JOH	003	009	Nicodemus responded and said to Him, How are these things able to he?
043	JOH	003	010	Jesus responded and said to him, Art thou a teacher of Israel and knowest not these things?
043	JOH	003	011	Truly, truly, I say unto thee, that we speak what we know, and testify what we have seen; and you received not our testimony.
043	JOH	003	012	If I spoke to you things upon the earth, and you do net believe, how will you believe, if I speak to you of things in heaven?
043	JOH	003	013	No one hath ascended up into heaven, but the one having come down from heaven, the Son of man, who is in heaven.
043	JOH	003	014	And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so does it behoove the Son of man to be lifted up:
043	JOH	003	015	that every one believing in Him may have eternal life.
043	JOH	003	016	For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one believing on Him may not perish but have eternal life.
043	JOH	003	017	For God sent not His Son into the world that He may condemn the world; but that the world through Him may be saved.
043	JOH	003	018	He that believeth on Him is not condemned; but he that believeth not, has already been condemned, because he has not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God.
043	JOH	003	019	And this is the condemnation, that light has come into the world, and men love darkness rather than light; for their works are evil.
043	JOH	003	020	For every one doing evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, in order that his works may not be convicted;
043	JOH	003	021	but every one doing the truth comes to the light, that his works may be made manifest, because they have been wrought in God.
043	JOH	003	022	After these things Jesus and His disciples came into the Judean country; and there He was tarrying with them and baptizing.
043	JOH	003	023	And John was also baptizing in Enon near Salim, because there were many waters there: and they came and baptized.
043	JOH	003	024	For John was not yet cast into prison.
043	JOH	003	025	And there was a disputation of the disciples of John, concerning purifying.
043	JOH	003	026	And they came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, He who is with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou hast borne witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all are coming to Him.
043	JOH	003	027	John responded and said, No man is able to receive anything, unless it may have been given unto him from heaven.
043	JOH	003	028	You are witnessing to me, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before Him.
043	JOH	003	029	The one having the bride is the Bridegroom: but the friend of the Bridegroom is the one standing and hearing him, rejoiceth with joy on account of the Bridegroom: This, my joy has been made complete.
043	JOH	003	030	It behooveth Him to increase, and me to decrease.
043	JOH	003	031	He that cometh from above is above all;
043	JOH	003	032	the one being of the earth is of the earth, and speaks of the earth. The one coming from heaven witnesses what He has seen and heard, and no one receives His testimony.
043	JOH	003	033	The one having received His testimony hath set his seal, that God is true.
043	JOH	003	034	For whom God sent speaketh the words of God: for He does not give His spirit by measure.
043	JOH	003	035	The Father loves the Son, and has given all things in His hands.
043	JOH	003	036	He that believes on the Son has eternal life; but he that believeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.
043	JOH	004	001	Thus when the Lord knew when the Pharisees heard that Jesus is making and baptizing more disciples than John
043	JOH	004	002	(truly Jesus himself was not baptizing, but His disciples),
043	JOH	004	003	He left Judea and came again into Galilee.
043	JOH	004	004	And it behooved Him to go through Samaria.
043	JOH	004	005	Then He comes into a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the place which Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
043	JOH	004	006	And the well of Jacob was there. Then Jesus having become weary from the journey, was sitting thus by the well: it was about the sixth hour.
043	JOH	004	007	A woman comes from Samaria to draw water. Jesus says to her, Give me to drink.
043	JOH	004	008	For His disciples had gone into the city, that they might purchase food.
043	JOH	004	009	A Samaritan woman says to Him, How do you, being a Jew, ask to drink from me, being a Samaritan woman?
043	JOH	004	010	And Jesus responded and said to her, If you knew the gift of God, and the one who is speaking to you, Give me to drink; you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.
043	JOH	004	011	The woman says to Him, Sir, thou hast no windlass, and the well is deep: whence hast thou living water?
043	JOH	004	012	Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and himself and his sons, and his herds, drank of it?
043	JOH	004	013	Jesus responded and said to her, Every one drinking of this water shall thirst again:
043	JOH	004	014	but whosoever may drink of the water that I shall give to him shall never thirst; but the water which I shall give to him shall be in him a well of water springing up unto eternal life.
043	JOH	004	015	Then the woman says to Him, Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come hither to draw.
043	JOH	004	016	He says to her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.
043	JOH	004	017	The woman responded and said, I have no husband. Jesus says to her, Well didst thou say, I have no husband:
043	JOH	004	018	for thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: thou hast spoken this truly.
043	JOH	004	019	The woman says to Him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.
043	JOH	004	020	Our fathers worshiped in this mountain; and you say, that in Jerusalem is the place where it behooveth to worship.
043	JOH	004	021	Jesus says to her, Believe me, woman, that the hour cometh, you will worship the Father neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem.
043	JOH	004	022	You worship, you know not what: we worship that which we know: because salvation is of the Jews.
043	JOH	004	023	But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such worshiping Him.
043	JOH	004	024	God is a Spirit, and it behooveth those who worship Him to worship in spirit and in truth.
043	JOH	004	025	The woman says to Him, I know that Messiah cometh (who is called Christ): when He may come, He will proclaim to us all things.
043	JOH	004	026	Jesus says to her, I who speak to thee am He.
043	JOH	004	027	And at this time His disciples came, and were wondering because He was speaking with the woman; no one said, What seekest thou? or, Why do you speak with her?
043	JOH	004	028	Then the woman left her waterpot, and went away into the city, and says to the men,
043	JOH	004	029	Come hither, see the man who told me all things which I did: Is not He the Christ?
043	JOH	004	030	They came out from the city, and came to Him.
043	JOH	004	031	Meanwhile His disciples were asking Him, saying, Master eat.
043	JOH	004	032	He said to them, I have meat to eat, which you know not.
043	JOH	004	033	Then His disciples were speaking to one another, Whether has any one brought Him something to eat?
043	JOH	004	034	Jesus says to them, My food is that I may do the will of Him that sent me, and finish His work.
043	JOH	004	035	Do you not say, That it is yet four months, and the harvest cometh? Behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes and see the fields, because they are white unto the harvest
043	JOH	004	036	already. He that reapeth receiveth reward, and gathereth fruit unto eternal life; in order that both the sower and the reaper may rejoice together.
043	JOH	004	037	For in this the word is true, that there is one sowing, and another reaping.
043	JOH	004	038	I have sent you to reap that upon which you have never labored: others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.
043	JOH	004	039	But many of the Samaritans from that city believed on Him through the word of the woman, testifying that, He told me all things which I did. Then when the Samaritans came to Him they asked Him to abide with them:
043	JOH	004	040	and He remained there two days:
043	JOH	004	041	and many more believed on Him through His word;
043	JOH	004	042	and they continued to say to the woman, We no longer believe through your talk; for we have heard and we know that He is truly the Savior of the world.
043	JOH	004	043	And after two days He departed thence into Galilee.
043	JOH	004	044	And Jesus Himself witnessed, that a prophet has no honor in his own country.
043	JOH	004	045	And when He came into Galilee, Galileans received Him, having seen all things which He did in Jerusalem at the feast: for they also came to the feast.
043	JOH	004	046	Then He came again into Cana of Galilee, where He turned the water into wine. And there was a certain royalist, whose son was sick in Capernaum;
043	JOH	004	047	he having heard that Jesus has come out of Judea into Galilee, came away to Him, and continued to ask Him that He may come down and heal his son; for He was about to die.
043	JOH	004	048	Then Jesus said to him, Unless you may see signs and wonders, you can not believe.
043	JOH	004	049	The nobleman says to Him, Lord, come down before my little child dies.
043	JOH	004	050	Jesus says to him, Go; thy son liveth. The man believed the word which Jesus spoke to him, and departed.
043	JOH	004	051	And he already coming down, the servants met him, and reported, that the child lives.
043	JOH	004	052	Then he inquired the hour at which he began to improve; and they said to him, The fever left him at the seventh hour yesterday.
043	JOH	004	053	Then the father knew that it was at that hour at which Jesus said to him, Thy son liveth: and he and all his house believed.
043	JOH	004	054	Jesus, having again come out of Judea into Galilee, wrought this second miracle.
043	JOH	005	001	After these things was the feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up into Jerusalem.
043	JOH	005	002	And there is a pool at the sheep-market, called in Hebrew Bethzatha, having five porches.
043	JOH	005	003	In them a multitude of the sick, blind, lame, withered, were lying down.
043	JOH	005	005	And a certain man was there, being thirty-eight years in his infirmity;
043	JOH	005	006	Jesus seeing him lying down, and knowing that he already has much time, says to him; Do you wish to be whole?
043	JOH	005	007	The sick man responded to Him, Lord, I have no man that may put me in the pool, when the water may be troubled: and while I come, another goes down before me.
043	JOH	005	008	And Jesus says to him, Arise, take thy bed, and walk about.
043	JOH	005	009	And the man was made whole, and he took up his bed and continued to walk about. And it was the Sabbath on that day.
043	JOH	005	010	Then the Jews were saying to the healed man, It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.
043	JOH	005	011	He responded to them, the one having made me whole, He said to me, Take thy bed, and walk about.
043	JOH	005	012	They asked him, Who is the man who said to thee, Take thy bed, and walk about?
043	JOH	005	013	And the sick man did not know who He is: for Jesus went out, the crowd being in the place.
043	JOH	005	014	And after these things, Jesus finds him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, thou hast been made whole: sin no more, lest something worse may come on thee.
043	JOH	005	015	And the man departed, and said to the Jews, that Jesus is the one having made him whole.
043	JOH	005	016	And on account of this the Jews continued to persecute Jesus, because He was doing these things on the Sabbath.
043	JOH	005	017	And He responded to them, My Father worketh until now, and I work.
043	JOH	005	018	Therefore the Jews the more sought to kill Him, because He not only broke the Sabbath, but said that God was His Father, making himself equal to God.
043	JOH	005	019	Then Jesus responded and said to them, Truly, truly, I say unto you, The Son is not able to do anything Himself, unless He may see the Father doing it: for whatsoever He may do, the Son likewise also doeth the same.
043	JOH	005	020	For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth Him all things which He doeth; and will show Him greater things than these, in order that you may be astonished.
043	JOH	005	021	For as the Father raiseth up the dead and createth life in them, so the Son also createth life in whom He will.
043	JOH	005	022	For the Father judgeth no one, for He hath given all judgment to the Son;
043	JOH	005	023	in order that all may honor the Son, as they may honor the Father. He that honoreth not the Son honoreth not the Father who sent Him.
043	JOH	005	024	Truly, truly, I say unto you, that every one hearing my word, and believing on Him that sent me hath eternal life, and doth not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.
043	JOH	005	025	Truly, truly, I say unto you, that the hour cometh and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God; and having heard will live.
043	JOH	005	026	For as the Father hath life in Himself, so also He has given to His Son to have life also in Himself.
043	JOH	005	027	And He hath given Him authority to execute the judgment, because He is the Son of man.
043	JOH	005	028	Do not be astonished at this: because the hour cometh, in which all who are in their graves will hear His voice,
043	JOH	005	029	and come forth; those having done good, unto the resurrection of life; and those having done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.
043	JOH	005	030	I am not able to do anything of myself: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is righteous; because I do not seek my own will, but the will of the One having sent me.
043	JOH	005	031	If I testify concerning myself, my testimony is not true.
043	JOH	005	032	There is another who testifieth concerning me; and you know that the testimony which He testifies concerning me is true.
043	JOH	005	033	You sent to John, and he witnessed to the truth:
043	JOH	005	034	but I do not receive the witness with man: but I speak these things that you may be saved.
043	JOH	005	035	He was a bright and shining light: and you were willing to rejoice for an hour in that light.
043	JOH	005	036	But I have a testimony greater than that of John: for the works that the Father hath given me that I may perfect them, these works which I do, testify concerning me, that the Father hath sent me.
043	JOH	005	037	And the Father having sent me, He hath testified concerning me: never have you heard His voice, neither have you seen His face:
043	JOH	005	038	and you have not His word abiding in you: because you do not believe Him whom He has sent.
043	JOH	005	039	Search the Scriptures, because in them ye think ye have eternal life; and they are they which testify concerning me;
043	JOH	005	040	and you do not wish to come unto me, in order that you may have life.
043	JOH	005	041	I do not receive glory with men;
043	JOH	005	042	but I know you that you have not the love of God in you.
043	JOH	005	043	I have come in the name of my Father, and you do not receive me: if another may come in his own name, you will receive him.
043	JOH	005	044	How are you able to believe, receiving glory from one another, and do not seek the glory which is with God only?
043	JOH	005	045	Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father; there is one accusing you, in whom you have hoped.
043	JOH	005	046	For if you were believing Moses, you were believing me; for he wrote concerning me.
043	JOH	005	047	For if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?
043	JOH	006	001	After these things Jesus went beyond the Sea of Galilee, of Tiberias.
043	JOH	006	002	And a great multitude followed Him, because they saw the miracles He was doing in behalf of the sick.
043	JOH	006	003	And Jesus came into the mountain; and was sitting there with His disciples.
043	JOH	006	004	And the passover, the feast of the Jews, was nigh.
043	JOH	006	005	Therefore Jesus lifting up His eyes, and seeing that a great multitude is coming to Him, He says to Philip, Whence can we purchase bread, that these may eat?
043	JOH	006	006	He spoke this testing him; for He knew what He was about to do.
043	JOH	006	007	Philip responded to Him, The loaves of two hundred denaria are not sufficient for these, that each one may receive a little.
043	JOH	006	008	And one of His disciples, Andrew, the brother of Peter, says to Him,
043	JOH	006	009	There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two fishes: but what are these among so many?
043	JOH	006	010	And Jesus said, Make the people sit down. And there was much grass in the place. However the men sat down in number about five thousand.
043	JOH	006	011	And Jesus took the bread; and gave thanks, and gave it to the disciples, and the disciples to the people sitting down; and likewise also of the fishes so much as they wished.
043	JOH	006	012	And when they were filled, He says to His disciples, Gather up the remaining fragments, that nothing may be lost.
043	JOH	006	013	Then they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets from the live barley loaves, which remained to those having eaten.
043	JOH	006	014	Then the people, seeing the miracle which Jesus did, were saying, that, This is truly the prophet who is coming into the world.
043	JOH	006	015	And Jesus knowing that they are about to come and take Him, that they may make Him king, departs again into the mountain Himself alone.
043	JOH	006	016	And when it was evening, His disciples went down to the sea;
043	JOH	006	017	and embarking in the ship, they were going to the other side of the sea into Capernaum. And it was already dark, and Jesus had not come to them;
043	JOH	006	018	and the sea wrought, a great wind blowing.
043	JOH	006	019	Then having gone about twenty-five or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and being near the ship; and were terrified.
043	JOH	006	020	And He says to them, I am here; fear not.
043	JOH	006	021	Then they wished to receive Him into the ship, and immediately the ship was at the land to which they were going.
043	JOH	006	022	On the following day the multitude standing beyond the sea saw that there was no other ship there, except one, and that Jesus did not go along with His disciples into the ship, but His disciples went away alone
043	JOH	006	023	(other ships came from Tiberias near the place where they ate the bread, the Lord having given thanks).
043	JOH	006	024	And when the multitude saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they went into ships, and came into Capernaum, seeking Jesus.
043	JOH	006	025	And having found Him beyond the sea, they said to Him, Master, when did you come hither?
043	JOH	006	026	Jesus responded to them and said, Truly, truly, I say unto you, You seek me not because you saw the miracles, but because you ate of the loaves, and were filled.
043	JOH	006	027	Labor not for the food that perishes, but the food that abideth unto eternal life, which the Son of man gives to you: for this God the Father hath sealed.
043	JOH	006	028	Then they said to Him, What must we do, that we may work the works of God?
043	JOH	006	029	Jesus responded and said to them, This is the work of God, that you may believe on Him whom He hath sent.
043	JOH	006	030	Then they said to Him, Then what miracle do you perform, that we may see, and believe you, what you may do?
043	JOH	006	031	Our fathers ate manna in the wilderness; as has been written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.
043	JOH	006	032	Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say unto you, Moses did not give you the bread from heaven; but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.
043	JOH	006	033	For the bread of God is the One coming down from heaven, and giving life to the world.
043	JOH	006	034	Then they said to Him, Lord, evermore give to us this bread.
043	JOH	006	035	Then Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life; the one coming unto me can never hunger, and the one believing on me shall never thirst.
043	JOH	006	036	But I said unto you, That you have seen, and you do not believe.
043	JOH	006	037	Everything which the Father giveth unto me shall come to me; and him that cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out.
043	JOH	006	038	Because I have come down from heaven, not that I may do my own will, but the will of Him that sent me.
043	JOH	006	039	And this is the will of the One having sent me, that everything that the Father has given unto me I shall lose nothing of it, but I shall raise it up in the last day.
043	JOH	006	040	For this is the will of my Father, that every one seeing the Son, and believing on Him, may have eternal life; and I will raise him up in the last day.
043	JOH	006	041	Then the Jews were murmuring concerning Him, because He said, I am the bread having come down from heaven,
043	JOH	006	042	and they continued to say, Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how does He now say; I have come down from heaven?
043	JOH	006	043	Jesus responded and said to them, Murmur not with one another.
043	JOH	006	044	No one is able to come unto me, unless the Father who sent me may draw him: and I will raise him up in the last day.
043	JOH	006	045	It is written in the prophets, They shall all be taught of God; every one hearing and learning from the Father, comes to me.
043	JOH	006	046	No one has seen the Father, except the One who is with God, He hath seen God.
043	JOH	006	047	Truly, truly, I say unto you, the one believing has eternal life.
043	JOH	006	048	I am the bread of life.
043	JOH	006	049	Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and died;
043	JOH	006	050	this is the bread coming down from heaven, that any one may eat of it, and not die.
043	JOH	006	051	I am the living bread, having come down from heaven; if any one may eat of me the bread, he will live forever: and the bread which I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.
043	JOH	006	052	Then the Jews were contending with one another, saying, How is this One able to give unto us His flesh to eat?
043	JOH	006	053	Then Jesus said unto them, Truly, truly, I say unto you, Unless you may eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink His blood, you have no life in you.
043	JOH	006	054	The one eating my flesh and drinking my blood has eternal life; and I will raise him up in the last day.
043	JOH	006	055	For my flesh is the true food, and my blood is the true drink.
043	JOH	006	056	The one eating my flesh and drinking my blood abides in me, and I in him.
043	JOH	006	057	As the living Father sent me, and I live through the Father; truly the one eating me, shall also live through me.
043	JOH	006	058	He is the bread having come down from heaven: not as the fathers ate, and died: the one eating this bread shall live forever.
043	JOH	006	059	And He spoke these things in the synagogue, teaching in Capernaum.
043	JOH	006	060	Then many of His disciples, hearing, said, This is a hard sermon; who is able to hear it?
043	JOH	006	061	And Jesus knowing in Himself that His disciples are murmuring concerning it, said to them, Does this offend you?
043	JOH	006	062	If then you may see the Son of man ascending up, where He was formerly?
043	JOH	006	063	The Spirit is the One who creates life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and life.
043	JOH	006	064	But there are certain ones of you who do not believe. For Jesus knew from the beginning that there are certain ones not believing, and there is one going to betray Him.
043	JOH	006	065	And He said, Therefore I have said unto you, that no one is able to come unto me, unless it may have been given unto him of the Father.
043	JOH	006	066	Moreover from this many of His disciples went back, and walked with Him no more.
043	JOH	006	067	Then Jesus said to the twelve, Do you also wish to go away?
043	JOH	006	068	Simon Peter responded to Him, Lord, to whom shall we go away? thou hast the words of eternal life;
043	JOH	006	069	we have believed and we know that thou art the Holy One of God.
043	JOH	006	070	Jesus responded to them, Have I not chosen you twelve, and one of you is devilish?
043	JOH	006	071	But He spoke of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon, for he was going to betray Him, being one of the twelve.
043	JOH	007	001	After these things Jesus walked about in Galilee: for He was not willing to walk about in Judea, because the Jews were seeking to kill Him.
043	JOH	007	002	And the feast of the Jews, tabernacles, was nigh.
043	JOH	007	003	Then His brothers said to Him; Depart hence, and go into Judea; in order that thy disciples shall see thy works which thou art doing. For no one does anything in secret, and Himself seeks to be public.
043	JOH	007	004	If thou doest these things, show thyself to the world.
043	JOH	007	005	For His brothers were not believing on Him.
043	JOH	007	006	Jesus says to them, My time is not yet; but your time is always ready.
043	JOH	007	007	The world is not able to hate you; but it hates me, because I testify against it, that its works are evil.
043	JOH	007	008	You go up to the feast: I do not go to this feast; because my time is not yet fulfilled.
043	JOH	007	009	Saying these things He remained in Galilee.
043	JOH	007	010	And when His brothers went up to the feast, then Himself also went up, not openly, but in secret.
043	JOH	007	011	Then the Jews were seeking Him at the feast, and saying, Where is He?
043	JOH	007	012	And there was much murmuring in the crowd concerning Him: some indeed were saying, That He is good; others were saying, No, but He deceives the multitude.
043	JOH	007	013	No one indeed was speaking openly concerning Him on account of the fear of the Jews.
043	JOH	007	014	But the feast already being midway, Jesus came up into the temple, and was teaching.
043	JOH	007	015	Then the Jews marveled, saying; How does this one know letters, never having been taught?
043	JOH	007	016	Then Jesus responded to them, and said, My teaching is not mine, but of Him that sent me;
043	JOH	007	017	if any one may will to do His will, he shall know concerning the teaching, whether it is of God, or I speak for myself.
043	JOH	007	018	He that speaketh from himself seeketh his own glory: he that seeketh the glory of Him that sent Him, the same is true, and there is no unrighteousness in Him.
043	JOH	007	019	Did not Moses give you the law? and no one of you does the law. Why do you seek to kill me?
043	JOH	007	020	And the multitude responded, Thou hast a demon: who seeks to kill thee?
043	JOH	007	021	Jesus responded and said to them, I did one work, and you were all astonished.
043	JOH	007	022	Moses gave you circumcision, not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers, and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.
043	JOH	007	023	If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath, in order that the law of Moses may not be broken; are you mad at me, because I made a man entirely whole on the Sabbath?
043	JOH	007	024	Judge not according to sight, but judge righteous judgment.
043	JOH	007	025	Then certain ones of Jerusalemites were saying, Is not this He whom they wished to kill?
043	JOH	007	026	And behold He speaks publicly, and they say nothing to Him. Whether do the rulers truly know that He is the Christ?
043	JOH	007	027	But we know Him whence He is: but when Christ may come, no one knows whence He is.
043	JOH	007	028	Then Jesus cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, You indeed know me, and know whence I am; and I have not come of myself, but the one sending me is true, whom you do not know.
043	JOH	007	029	I know Him, because I am with Him, and He sent me.
043	JOH	007	030	Then they were seeking to arrest Him: and no one laid a hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come.
043	JOH	007	031	And many from the multitude believed on Him; and continued to say, When Christ may come, will He do more miracles than this one is doing?
043	JOH	007	032	The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things concerning Him; and the chief priests and Pharisees sent officers, that they should arrest Him.
043	JOH	007	033	Then Jesus said, Yet a little while I am with you, and I go to Him that sent me.
043	JOH	007	034	You will seek me, and will not find me: and where I am, you are not able to come.
043	JOH	007	035	Then the Jews said to themselves, Where is He about to go, that we shall not find Him? is He about to go into the Dispersion of the Greek, and teach the Greeks?
043	JOH	007	036	What is this word which He said, You shall seek me, and not find me: and where I am, you are not able to come?
043	JOH	007	037	And on the last great day of the feast, Jesus stood and continued to cry out, saying, If any one thirst, let him come and drink.
043	JOH	007	038	The one believing on me, as the Scripture said, out of his heart shall flow rivers of living water.
043	JOH	007	039	And He spoke this concerning the Spirit, whom those believing on Him were about to receive: for the Spirit was not yet; because Jesus was not yet glorified.
043	JOH	007	040	Then those hearing these words from the multitude, were saying, This is truly the prophet;
043	JOH	007	041	others were saying, He is the Christ; others were saying, For whether does Christ come out of Galilee?
043	JOH	007	042	Did not the Scripture say, that Christ comes from the seed of David and from the village of Bethlehem, where David was?
043	JOH	007	043	Then there was a schism in the crowd on account of Him:
043	JOH	007	044	and some of them wished to arrest Him; but no one laid hands on Him.
043	JOH	007	045	Then the officers came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, Why did you not bring Him?
043	JOH	007	046	The officers responded, Never did a man so speak, as this man speaks.
043	JOH	007	047	And the Pharisees responded to them; Are ye also deceived?
043	JOH	007	048	Whether has any one of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on Him?
043	JOH	007	049	But this crowd knowing not the law are accursed.
043	JOH	007	050	Nicodemus being one of them, says to them;
043	JOH	007	051	Whether does our law judge a man, until it may first hear from him and know what he does?
043	JOH	007	052	They responded and said to him, Whither art thou also from Galilee? Search, and see that no prophet rises out of Galilee.
043	JOH	008	012	Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, I am the light of the world: the one following me can not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of the life.
043	JOH	008	013	Then the Pharisees said to Him, Thou art testifying concerning thyself; Thy testimony is not true. And Jesus responded and said to them,
043	JOH	008	014	If I testify concerning myself, my testimony is true; for I know whence I came, and whither I go. You know not whence I come, or whither I go.
043	JOH	008	015	You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.
043	JOH	008	016	If I judge, my judgment is true; because I am not alone, but I and the One having sent me.
043	JOH	008	017	And it has been written in our law, that the testimony of two men is true.
043	JOH	008	018	I am the one testifying concerning myself, and the Father having sent me, testifies concerning me.
043	JOH	008	019	Then they said to Him, Where is thy Father? Jesus responded; You know neither me nor my Father; if you knew me, you would also know my Father.
043	JOH	008	020	He spoke these words in the treasury, teaching in the temple: and no one arrested Him; because His hour had not yet come.
043	JOH	008	021	Then He again said to them, I go away, and you will seek me, and you will die in your sin: whither I go you are not able to come.
043	JOH	008	022	Then the Jews were saying, Whether will He kill Himself, because He says, Whither I go away, you are not able to come?
043	JOH	008	023	And He said to them, You are from beneath; I am from above: you are of this world; I am not of this world.
043	JOH	008	024	Therefore I said to you, that you shall die in your sins: for if you may not believe that I am He, you shall die in your sins.
043	JOH	008	025	Then they said to Him, Who art thou? And Jesus said to them, Even that which I also speak to you from the beginning.
043	JOH	008	026	I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you; but the One having sent me is true; those things which I heard with Him, these I speak to the world.
043	JOH	008	027	They did not know that He spoke to them concerning the Father.
043	JOH	008	028	Then Jesus said, When you may lift up the Son of man, then you shall know that I am He, and I do nothing of myself, but as the Father has taught me, I speak the same things.
043	JOH	008	029	Truly the One having sent me is with me; He has not left me alone; because I always do those things which are pleasing to Him.
043	JOH	008	030	He speaking these things, many believed on Him.
043	JOH	008	031	Then Jesus said to the Jews, who believed on Him, If you may abide in my word, you are truly my disciples;
043	JOH	008	032	and you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
043	JOH	008	033	They responded to Him, we are the seed of Abraham, and have never been in bondage to any one: How do You say, that you shall be free?
043	JOH	008	034	Jesus responded to them, Truly, truly, I say unto you, That every one doing sin is the slave of sin.
043	JOH	008	035	But the slave abides not in the house forever; the Son abides forever.
043	JOH	008	036	If therefore the Son may make you free, you shall be free indeed.
043	JOH	008	037	I know ye are the seed of Abraham; but you seek to kill me, because my word has no place in you.
043	JOH	008	038	Whatsoever I have seen with the Father I speak: you therefore are doing the things which you heard with your father.
043	JOH	008	039	They responded and said to Him, Abraham is our Father. Jesus says to them, If you were the children of Abraham, you would do the works of Abraham.
043	JOH	008	040	But now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth, which I heard with God: Abraham did not this.
043	JOH	008	041	You are doing the works of your father. They said to Him, We are not born of fornication; we have one Father, God.
043	JOH	008	042	Jesus said to them; If God were your Father, you would love me: for I came out from God, and I return; for I have not spoken from myself, but He sent me.
043	JOH	008	043	Wherefore do you not understand my speech? Because you are not able to hear my word.
043	JOH	008	044	You are of your father the devil, and you wish to do the lusts of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and stood not in the truth, because there was no truth in him. When he may speak a lie, he speaks of his own: because he is a liar, and the father of the same.
043	JOH	008	045	And because I speak the truth, you do not believe me.
043	JOH	008	046	Which one of you convicts me concerning sin? If I speak the truth, why do you not believe me?
043	JOH	008	047	The one being of God hears the words of God: on account of this you do not hear, because you are not of God.
043	JOH	008	048	The Jews responded and said to Him, Do we not truly say that you are a Samaritan, and have a demon?
043	JOH	008	049	Jesus responded, I have not a demon; but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.
043	JOH	008	050	But I do not seek my own glory: there is One seeking and judging.
043	JOH	008	051	Truly, truly, I say unto you, if any one may keep my word, he may never see death.
043	JOH	008	052	The Jews said to Him, Now we know that thou hast a demon. Abraham and the prophets are dead; and thou sayest, If any one may keep my word, he may never taste death.
043	JOH	008	053	Whether art thou greater than our father Abraham, who died? and the prophets died: whom do you make yourself?
043	JOH	008	054	Jesus responded, If I may glorify myself, my glory is nothing: my Father is the one glorifying me; whom you say, that, He is our God;
043	JOH	008	055	indeed you do not know Him: but I know Him. If I may say, I know Him not, I will be a liar like you: but I know Him, and I keep His word.
043	JOH	008	056	Abraham, our father, rejoiced that he might see my day; he saw it, and was glad.
043	JOH	008	057	Then the Jews said to Him, You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?
043	JOH	008	058	Jesus said unto them, Truly, truly, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.
043	JOH	008	059	Then they took up stones that they might cast at Him: and Jesus was hidden, and departed out from the temple.
043	JOH	009	001	And passing along, He saw a man blind from his birth.
043	JOH	009	002	And His disciples asked Him, saying, Master, who sinned, this one, or his parents, that he was born blind?
043	JOH	009	003	Jesus responded, Neither did he nor his parents sin; but that the works of God may be made manifest in him.
043	JOH	009	004	It behooveth us to work the works of Him that sent us, while it is day: the night comes, when no one is able to work.
043	JOH	009	005	While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
043	JOH	009	006	Saying these words, He spat on the ground, and made mortar out of the spittle, and besmeared the mortar on his eyes,
043	JOH	009	007	and He said to him; Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is interpreted, Sent). Then he went away, and washed, and came seeing.
043	JOH	009	008	Then the neighbors, and those seeing him previously, because he was a beggar, continued to say, Is not this the one sitting and begging?
043	JOH	009	009	Some said, That he is: others said, No, but he is like him: he said, I am he.
043	JOH	009	010	Then they said to him, How then were your eyes opened?
043	JOH	009	011	He responded, a man called Jesus made mortar and besmeared my eyes, and said, Go to Siloam, and wash. Then having gone away and washed, I looked up.
043	JOH	009	012	They said to him, Where is He? He says, I know not.
043	JOH	009	013	They lead him to the Pharisees, him formerly blind.
043	JOH	009	014	And it was the Sabbath on the day on which Jesus made mortar, and opened his eyes.
043	JOH	009	015	Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he looked up. And he said to them, He placed the mortar on my eyes, and I washed, and see.
043	JOH	009	016	Then certain ones of the Pharisees said, This man is not with God, because He does not keep the Sabbath. Others said, How is a wicked man able to do such miracles? And there was a division among them.
043	JOH	009	017	Then they again say to the blind man, What do you say concerning Him, because He opened your eyes? And he said that, He is a prophet.
043	JOH	009	018	Then the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he was blind, and looked up, until they called the parents of him that looked up,
043	JOH	009	019	and asked them, saying, Is this your son, who you say was born blind? how then does he now see?
043	JOH	009	020	Then his parents responded and said; We know that he is our son, and that he was born blind:
043	JOH	009	021	but how he now sees, we know not; nor who opened his eyes, we know not: ask him; he has majority; he will speak for himself.
043	JOH	009	022	And his parents said these things, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had already stipulated, that if any one should confess Him to be Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
043	JOH	009	023	Therefore his parents said that, He has majority, ask him.
043	JOH	009	024	Then they asked the man the second time who was blind, and said to him, Give God the glory: we know that this man is a sinner.
043	JOH	009	025	Then he responded, If He is a sinner, I know not: one thing I do know, that being blind I now see.
043	JOH	009	026	Then they said to him, What did He to you? how did He open your eyes?
043	JOH	009	027	He responded to them, I told you already, and you did not hearken: why do you wish to hear again? whether do you wish to become His disciples?
043	JOH	009	028	They railed on him, and said, You are His disciple; but we are the disciples of Moses:
043	JOH	009	029	we know that God spoke to Moses: but we do not know this One, whence He is.
043	JOH	009	030	The man responded and said to them; For in this it is wonderful, that you do not know whence He is, He truly opened my eyes.
043	JOH	009	031	We know that God hears not sinners: but if any one may be a worshiper of God, and do His will, He hears him.
043	JOH	009	032	It was never heard of from the beginning that any one opened the eyes of a man who was born blind:
043	JOH	009	033	if He were not with God, He would not be able to do anything.
043	JOH	009	034	They responded and said to him, Thou art altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.
043	JOH	009	035	Jesus heard that they cast him out; and having found him, said, Do you believe on the Son of man?
043	JOH	009	036	He responded and said, Who is He, Lord, that I may believe on, Him?
043	JOH	009	037	Jesus said to him, Indeed you have seen Him, and the One speaking with you is He.
043	JOH	009	038	And He said, I believe, Lord: and he worshiped Him.
043	JOH	009	039	And Jesus said, For judgment I came into this world, that those not seeing may see; and those seeing may be made blind.
043	JOH	009	040	And those of the Pharisees being with Him heard, and said to Him, Whether are we also blind?
043	JOH	009	041	Jesus said to them, If you were blind you would not have sin: but now you say that, We see: your sin remaineth.
043	JOH	010	001	Truly, truly, I say unto you, the one coming not in through the door into the fold of the sheep, but climbing up some other way, he is a thief and a robber.
043	JOH	010	002	And the one coming in through the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
043	JOH	010	003	To him the porter opens; and the sheep hear His voice: and he calls His own sheep by name, and leads them out.
043	JOH	010	004	When He may put out all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow Him: because they know his voice:
043	JOH	010	005	but they will not follow a stranger, but will flee from him: because they know not the voice of strangers.
043	JOH	010	006	He spoke this parable to them: but they did not know what things He was speaking to them.
043	JOH	010	007	Then Jesus said, Truly, truly, I say unto you, that I am the door of the sheep.
043	JOH	010	008	All so many as came were thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.
043	JOH	010	009	I am the door: if any one may enter in through me, he shall be saved; he shall go in and come out, and find pasture.
043	JOH	010	010	The thief does not come, but that he may steal, and slay, and destroy: I came that they may have life, and have it more abundantly.
043	JOH	010	011	I am the Good Shepherd. The Good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.
043	JOH	010	012	The hireling, and the one not being the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep, and flees away, and the wolf seizes and scatters them:
043	JOH	010	013	because he is a hireling and there is not a care to him for the sheep.
043	JOH	010	014	I am the Good Shepherd; I know mine, and mine know me,
043	JOH	010	015	as the Father knows Me, and I know the Father; and I lay down My soul for the sheep.
043	JOH	010	016	And I have other sheep which are not of this fold: and it behooves me to bring them and they shall hear my voice, and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.
043	JOH	010	017	Therefore my Father loves Me, because I lay down my soul, that I may take it again.
043	JOH	010	018	No one takes it from Me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and power to receive it again. I received this commandment from my Father.
043	JOH	010	019	Again there was a schism among the Jews on account of these words.
043	JOH	010	020	Then many of them were saying, He has a demon, and is gone mad; why do you hear Him? Others were saying,
043	JOH	010	021	These are not the words of a demonized man. Whether is a demon able to open the eyes of the blind?
043	JOH	010	022	And it was the feast of dedication in Jerusalem: and it was winter;
043	JOH	010	023	and Jesus was walking in the temple in Solomon's porch.
043	JOH	010	024	Then the Jews surrounded Him, and said to Him, How long do you take away our soul?
043	JOH	010	025	If thou art the Christ, tell us openly. Jesus responded, I told you, and you do not believe: the works which I do in the name of my Father, these testify concerning me.
043	JOH	010	026	But you do not believe, because you are not of my sheep.
043	JOH	010	027	My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:
043	JOH	010	028	and I give to them eternal life; and they shall never perish, and no one shall pluck them out of my hand.
043	JOH	010	029	The Father, who has given them unto me, is greater than all; and no one is able to pluck them out of the hand of the Father.
043	JOH	010	030	I and the Father are one.
043	JOH	010	031	Again the Jews took up stones, that they might stone Him.
043	JOH	010	032	Jesus responded to them, I have shown unto you many beautiful works from the Father; on account of which of these do you stone me?
043	JOH	010	033	The Jews responded to Him, We do not stone Thee for good work, but for blasphemy; because Thou, being a man, art making Thyself God.
043	JOH	010	034	And Jesus responded to them, Is it not written in your law, that I said, Ye are gods?
043	JOH	010	035	If He called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture is not able to be broken),
043	JOH	010	036	whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, do you say; Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?
043	JOH	010	037	If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.
043	JOH	010	038	If I do, believe not me, believe the works: that you may know and understand that the Father is in Me, and I in the Father.
043	JOH	010	039	They sought again to take Him: and He passed out of their hand.
043	JOH	010	040	And again He departed beyond the Jordan into the place where John was first baptizing; and remained there:
043	JOH	010	041	and many came to Hint, and said, that John indeed did no miracle; but all things so many as John spoke concerning this One are true.
043	JOH	010	042	And many believed on Him there.
043	JOH	011	001	And a certain one was sick, Lazarus from Bethany, of the village of Mary and Martha her sister.
043	JOH	011	002	And Mary was the one anointing the Lord with myrrh, and wiping His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.
043	JOH	011	003	Then the sisters sent to Him, saying, Lord, behold the one whom thou lovest is sick.
043	JOH	011	004	And Jesus hearing said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.
043	JOH	011	005	Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus, with Divine love.
043	JOH	011	006	Therefore when He heard that he was sick, He then remained two days in the place in which He was.
043	JOH	011	007	Then after this He says to the disciples, Let us go again unto Judea.
043	JOH	011	008	The disciples said to Him, Master, the Jews were but now seeking to stone thee; dost thou go hither again?
043	JOH	011	009	Jesus responded, Are there not twelve hours of the day? If any one may walk in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world:
043	JOH	011	010	if any one may walk in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.
043	JOH	011	011	He spoke these things: and after this He says to them, Our friend Lazarus is asleep; and I go that I may awaken him.
043	JOH	011	012	Then the disciples said to Him, Lord, if he is asleep, he will be saved.
043	JOH	011	013	But Jesus spoke concerning his death: and they thought that He spoke concerning the rest of sleep.
043	JOH	011	014	Then however Jesus spoke to them openly, Lazarus is dead,
043	JOH	011	015	and I rejoice on account of you that I was not there, in order that you may believe; but let us go to him.
043	JOH	011	016	Then Thomas, called Didymus, said to his fellow-disciples; Let us go too, that we may die with Him.
043	JOH	011	017	Then Jesus having come, found him having four days in the sepulcher.
043	JOH	011	018	But Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs.
043	JOH	011	019	And many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, that they might comfort them concerning their brother.
043	JOH	011	020	Then Martha, when she heard that Jesus comes, went to meet Him: and Mary sat in the house.
043	JOH	011	021	Then Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
043	JOH	011	022	And now I know that, whatsoever things you may ask of God, God will give to you.
043	JOH	011	023	Jesus says to her, Thy brother will rise again.
043	JOH	011	024	Martha says to Him, I know he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day.
043	JOH	011	025	Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection and the life; the one believing on me, though he may die, shall live: and
043	JOH	011	026	every one living and believing on me can never die: do you believe this?
043	JOH	011	027	She says to Him, Yes, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, come into the world.
043	JOH	011	028	And having said this, she departed, and called her sister Mary, speaking secretly, The Teacher is present, and calls you.
043	JOH	011	029	She, when she heard, arises quickly, and comes to Him:
043	JOH	011	030	Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was yet in the place where Martha met Him.
043	JOH	011	031	Then the Jews being with her in the house, and comforting her, seeing Mary, that she arose up quickly and went out, followed her, thinking that she goes to the tomb in order that she may weep there.
043	JOH	011	032	Then Mary, when she came where Jesus was, seeing Him, fell at His feet, saying to Him, Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
043	JOH	011	033	Then when Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews, having come with her, weeping, He groaned in spirit, and troubled Himself,
043	JOH	011	034	and said, Where have you laid him? They say to Him, Lord, come and see.
043	JOH	011	035	Jesus wept.
043	JOH	011	036	Then the Jews were saying, Behold, how He loved him as a friend!
043	JOH	011	037	And some of them said, Was not this One, having opened the eyes of the blind, able to bring it to pass, that he indeed should not die?
043	JOH	011	038	Then Jesus again groaning in Himself comes to the tomb; and it was a cave, and a stone was laid upon it.
043	JOH	011	039	Jesus says; Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of the dead, says to Him; Lord, already he smelleth: for he is dead four days.
043	JOH	011	040	Jesus says to her; Did I not tell thee, that, if thou canst believe, thou shalt see the glory of God?
043	JOH	011	041	Then they took away the stone; and Jesus lifted up His eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee, because Thou hast heard Me.
043	JOH	011	042	I know that Thou dost always hear Me; but on account of the multitude standing around I spoke, in order that they might believe that Thou didst send Me.
043	JOH	011	043	And speaking these things, He cried out with a great voice, Lazarus, come forth.
043	JOH	011	044	And the dead came out, bound as to his feet and hands with graveclothes; and his face bound round with a napkin. Jesus says to them, Loose him, and let him go.
043	JOH	011	045	Then many of the Jews, having come to Mary and seeing the things which He did, believed on Him:
043	JOH	011	046	but certain ones of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them the things which Jesus did.
043	JOH	011	047	Then the chief priests and Pharisees assembled the Sanhedrin, and continued to say, What are we doing? because this man is doing many miracles.
043	JOH	011	048	If we thus let Him alone, all will believe on Him: and the Romans will come and take away our place and nation.
043	JOH	011	049	But one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them,
043	JOH	011	050	You know nothing, you do not consider that it is profitable to you, that one man may die for the people, and the whole nation perish not.
043	JOH	011	051	And he spoke this not of himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was about to die for the nation.
043	JOH	011	052	And not only for the nation, but that He may gather into one the children of God dispersed abroad.
043	JOH	011	053	Then from that day they passed the verdict, that they would kill Him.
043	JOH	011	054	Therefore Jesus walked no more publicly among the Jews, but went away thence into the country near the desert, into a city called Ephraim; and there tarried with His disciples.
043	JOH	011	055	And the passover of the Jews was nigh, and many came up out of the country into Jerusalem before the passover, in order that they might purify themselves.
043	JOH	011	056	Then they were seeking Jesus, and standing in the temple, they were saying one with another, What seems to you; that He may not come to the feast?
043	JOH	011	057	And both the high priests and Pharisees had given commandment, if any one should know where He is, he should communicate it, in order that they might arrest Him.
043	JOH	012	001	Then Jesus, six days before the passover came into Bethany, where Lazarus, whom Jesus raised from the dead, was,
043	JOH	012	002	Then they made a supper for Him there: and Martha was serving; and Lazarus was one of those sitting at the table with Him.
043	JOH	012	003	Then Mary taking a pound of myrrh of spikenard, estimated very valuable, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the myrrh.
043	JOH	012	004	Then Judas Iscariot, one of His disciples, the one about to betray Him, says:
043	JOH	012	005	Why was not this myrrh sold for three hundred denaria, and given to the poor?
043	JOH	012	006	And He spoke this, not because there was a care to him for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the purse, and was carrying those things cast in.
043	JOH	012	007	Then Jesus said, Let her alone; she hath reserved this unto the day of my burial;
043	JOH	012	008	for you have the poor always with you; but you have not me always.
043	JOH	012	009	then a great multitude of the Jews came not only on account of Jesus, but that they might see Lazarus, whom He raised from the dead; because he was there.
043	JOH	012	010	But the chief priest passed an edict that they would also slay Lazarus;
043	JOH	012	011	because through him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.
043	JOH	012	012	On the following day a great multitude having come to the feast, hearing that Jesus comes into Jerusalem,
043	JOH	012	013	They took the branches of the palm-trees, and went out to meet Him, and continued to cry out, Hosanna: blessed is He that cometh, in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel.
043	JOH	012	014	And Jesus, having found a young donkey, sat upon him, as has been written,
043	JOH	012	015	Fear not, daughter of Zion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting upon the colt of a donkey.
043	JOH	012	016	But His disciples at first did not understand these things: but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written in reference to Him, and they did them to Him.
043	JOH	012	017	Then the multitude being with Him witnessed that He called Lazarus out of the sepulcher, and raised him from the dead.
043	JOH	012	018	Therefore the multitude also went to meet Him, because they heard that He had wrought this miracle.
043	JOH	012	019	Then the Pharisees said to one another, You see, that you are prevailing as to nothing: behold, the world has gone away after Him.
043	JOH	012	020	And there was certain Greeks of those having come up that they might worship at the feast:
043	JOH	012	021	then they came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and requested him, saying, Sir, we wish to see Jesus.
043	JOH	012	022	Philip comes and tells Andrew: Andrew and Philip go, and speak to Jesus.
043	JOH	012	023	And Jesus responds to them, saying, The hour has come, that the Son of man may be glorified.
043	JOH	012	024	Truly, truly, I say unto you, Unless the grain of wheat having fallen into the ground may die, it remains alone; but if it may die, it produces much fruit.
043	JOH	012	025	The one loving his soul shall lose it; but the one that hateth his soul in this world will preserve it unto eternal life.
043	JOH	012	026	If any one may minister unto me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall my minister be: if any one may minister unto me, the Father will honor him.
043	JOH	012	027	Now my soul is troubled; and what do I say? Father, save me from this hour. But on this account I came to this hour.
043	JOH	012	028	Father, glorify thy name. Then a voice came from heaven, I have indeed glorified thee, and will glorify thee again.
043	JOH	012	029	Then the multitudes standing, hearing, said, That it was thunder; others said, An angel has spoken to Him.
043	JOH	012	030	Jesus responded and said, This voice was not on account of me, but on account of you.
043	JOH	012	031	Now is the judgment of this world: now the prince of this world shall be cast out.
043	JOH	012	032	And if I may be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men towards me.
043	JOH	012	033	And He spoke this, signifying by what death He was about to die.
043	JOH	012	034	Then the multitude responded to Him; We have heard from the law that Christ abideth forever; and how do You say, That it behooveth the Son of man to be lifted up? who is this Son of man?
043	JOH	012	035	Then Jesus said to them, Yet a little while the light is with you. Walk about as you have the light, in order that the darkness may not overtake you: and he that walketh about in darkness does not know where he is going.
043	JOH	012	036	While you have the light, believe in the light, in order that you may be the sons of light. And Jesus spoke these things, and having gone out was hidden from them.
043	JOH	012	037	And He having done so many miracles in their presence, they were not believing on Him,
043	JOH	012	038	in order that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, Lord, who hath believed our report? And to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?
043	JOH	012	039	Wherefore were they not able to believe, because Isaiah again said,
043	JOH	012	040	He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; in order that they may not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and turn, and I shall heal them.
043	JOH	012	041	Isaiah said these things, because he saw His glory; and spoke concerning Him.
043	JOH	012	042	Nevertheless indeed many of the rulers also believed on Him; but they were not confessing Him on account of the Pharisees, in order that they might not be put out of the synagogues:
043	JOH	012	043	for they loved the glory of the people more than the glory of God.
043	JOH	012	044	But Jesus cried out and said; The one believing on me, believes not on me, but on Him that sent me,
043	JOH	012	045	and the one seeing me, sees the one that sent me.
043	JOH	012	046	I have come a light into the world, in order that every one believing on me may not abide in darkness.
043	JOH	012	047	And if any one may hear my words, and not keep them, I do not judge him: for I came not that I may judge the world, but that I may save the world.
043	JOH	012	048	He that rejects me, and receiving not my words, has one judging him: the word which I have spoken, it will judge him in the last day.
043	JOH	012	049	Because I have not spoken of Myself; but the Father Himself having sent me, gave me commandment, what I shall speak, and what I shall say.
043	JOH	012	050	And I know that His commandment is eternal life. Now whatsoever thing I say, as the Father has spoken unto me, so I say.
043	JOH	013	001	And before the feast of the passover, Jesus knowing that the hour has come when He must depart out of this world to His Father, having loved His own who were in the world, with divine love, He loved them perfectly.
043	JOH	013	002	And the supper being on hand, the devil already having entered into the heart, that Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, should betray Him,
043	JOH	013	003	knowing that the Father has given all things into His hands, and He came out from God, and is going away to God,
043	JOH	013	004	He rises from the supper, and lays aside His garments, and taking a towel, girded Himself;
043	JOH	013	005	then He pours water into a bowl, and began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded.
043	JOH	013	006	Then He comes to Simon Peter; he says to Him; Lord, do you wash my feet?
043	JOH	013	007	Jesus responded and said to him, What I do you know not now; but shall understand hereafter.
043	JOH	013	008	Peter says to Him, You may never wash my feet. Jesus responded to him, If I wash thee not, thou hast not part with me.
043	JOH	013	009	And Simon Peter says to Him, Lord, not only my feet, but my hands and my head.
043	JOH	013	010	Jesus says to Him, He that is bathed hath no need to wash his hands, but is altogether clean: and you are clean, but not all.
043	JOH	013	011	For He knew the one betraying Him. On this account He said, You are not all clean.
043	JOH	013	012	Then when He washed their feet, and took His garments, and sat down again, He said to them, Do you understand what I have done to you?
043	JOH	013	013	You call me Master and Lord, and you speak beautifully; for I am.
043	JOH	013	014	If then I, your Lord and Master, washed your feet, you ought also to wash the feet of one another.
043	JOH	013	015	For I have given unto you an example, that you may also do as I have done to you.
043	JOH	013	016	Truly, truly, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; nor the apostle greater than him that sent him.
043	JOH	013	017	If you know these things, happy are ye if you may do them.
043	JOH	013	018	I do not speak concerning you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the Scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.
043	JOH	013	019	Now I tell you before it takes place, in order that you may believe, when it may be done, that I am He.
043	JOH	013	020	Truly, truly, I say unto you, The one receiving the one whom I may send, receiveth me; and the one receiving me, receives Him that sent me.
043	JOH	013	021	Jesus saying these things, was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said; Truly, truly, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.
043	JOH	013	022	Then the disciples began to look to one another, being at a loss concerning which one He speaks.
043	JOH	013	023	And one of His disciples, whom Jesus loved, was leaning on the bosom of Jesus.
043	JOH	013	024	Then Simon Peter beckons to him, to ask who he might be concerning whom He speaks.
043	JOH	013	025	And that one, falling toward the bosom of Jesus says to Him, Lord, who is he?
043	JOH	013	026	And Jesus responds, He is that one to whom, having dipped the morsel, I will give it. And having dipped the morsel, He takes it, and gives it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.
043	JOH	013	027	And after the morsel, Satan entered into him. Then Jesus says to him; What thou art doing, do more quickly.
043	JOH	013	028	And no one of those sitting with Him knew what He said to him:
043	JOH	013	029	for some thought, as Judas had the purse, that Jesus says to him, Purchase some of those things of which we have need at the supper; or something that he might give to the poor.
043	JOH	013	030	Then he having taken the morsel, went out immediately: and it was night.
043	JOH	013	031	Then when he went out, Jesus says, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in Him.
043	JOH	013	032	And if God is glorified in Him, God will indeed glorify Him in Himself, and will glorify Him immediately.
043	JOH	013	033	Children, I am still with you. You shall seek me, and as I said to the Jews, Whither I go, you are not able to come; and now I say to you.
043	JOH	013	034	I give unto a new commandment, That you must love one another with divine love; as I have loved you with divine love, that you must also love one another with divine love:
043	JOH	013	035	in this shall all know that you are my disciples, if you may have divine love one with another.
043	JOH	013	036	Simon Peter says to Him; Lord, whither do you go? Jesus responded, Whither I go you are not able to follow me now; but shall follow me hereafter.
043	JOH	013	037	Peter says to Him; Lord, why am I not able to follow thee now? I will lay down my soul for thee.
043	JOH	013	038	Jesus responds to him, Wilt thou lay down thy soul for me? Truly, truly, I say unto thee, that the cock shall not crow, until thou shalt thrice deny me.
043	JOH	014	001	Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.
043	JOH	014	002	Many mansions are in the house of my Father; but if it were not so, I would have told you; because I go to prepare a place for you.
043	JOH	014	003	And if I may go and prepare a place for you, I come again, and will receive you unto myself; in order that you may also be where I am.
043	JOH	014	004	And whither I go, you know the way.
043	JOH	014	005	And Thomas says to Him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest: and how do we know the way?
043	JOH	014	006	Jesus says to him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no one cometh to the Father, but through me.
043	JOH	014	007	If you have known me, you shall also know my Father: and henceforth you know Him and have seen Him.
043	JOH	014	008	Philip says to Him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.
043	JOH	014	009	Jesus says to Him, Am I so long time with you, and hast thou not known me, Philip? The one having seen me hath seen the Father: how do you say, Show us the Father?
043	JOH	014	010	Dost thou not believe, that I am in the Father, and the Father is in me? The words which I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father who abideth in me doeth His own works.
043	JOH	014	011	Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me; or if not, believe for the sake of the works themselves.
043	JOH	014	012	Truly, truly, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, shall also do the works which I am doing; and shall do greater works than these: because I go to the Father:
043	JOH	014	013	and whatsoever you may ask in my name, I will do it, in order that the rather may be glorified in the Son.
043	JOH	014	014	If you may ask anything of me in my name, I will do it.
043	JOH	014	015	If you love me, keep my commandments.
043	JOH	014	016	And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you always,
043	JOH	014	017	the Spirit of truth: which the world is not able to receive, because it does not see Him, nor know Him: you know Him: because He abideth with you, and shall be in you.
043	JOH	014	018	I will not leave you orphans: I am coming to you.
043	JOH	014	019	Vet a little while, and the world sees me no more; but you see me: because I live, you shall live also.
043	JOH	014	020	In that day you shall know that I am in the Father, you in me, and I in you.
043	JOH	014	021	The one having my commandments, and keeping them, he is the one loving me with divine love: the one loving me with divine love, shall be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will manifest myself unto him.
043	JOH	014	022	Judas. (not Iscariot), says to Him, Lord, and how is it that you are about to manifest yourself to us, and not to the world?
043	JOH	014	023	Jesus responded and said to him; If any one may love me with divine love, he will keep my word: and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and will make our mansion with him.
043	JOH	014	024	The one not loving me with divine love does not keep my words: and the word which you hear is not mine, but that of the Father who sent me.
043	JOH	014	025	I have spoken these things to you, abiding with you:
043	JOH	014	026	but the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, He will teach you all things, and remind you of all things, which I spoke to you.
043	JOH	014	027	My peace I leave with you; my peace I give unto you: not as the world gives, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, nor afraid.
043	JOH	014	028	You heard that I said to you, I go away, and I come to you. If you love me with divine love, you would rejoice, because I go to my Father: because the Father is greater than I.
043	JOH	014	029	And I have now told you before it takes place, in order that, when it may come to pass, you may believe.
043	JOH	014	030	I shall no longer speak many things with you, because the prince of the world comes: and he has nothing in me;
043	JOH	014	031	but in order that the world may know that I love the Father, and as He commanded, so I am doing. Arise, let us go hence.
043	JOH	015	001	I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.
043	JOH	015	002	Every branch in me not producing fruit, He takes it away: and every one producing fruit, He purifies it, that it may produce more fruit.
043	JOH	015	003	So ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.
043	JOH	015	004	Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch is not able to produce fruit of itself, unless it may abide in the vine; so you are not able, unless you may abide in me.
043	JOH	015	005	I am the vine, and ye are the branches. The one abiding in me, and I in him, the same bears much fruit: because you are not able to do anything without me.
043	JOH	015	006	If any one may not abide in me, he is cast out as a branch, and withered; and they gather it, and cast it into the fire, and it is burnt.
043	JOH	015	007	If you may abide in me, and my words may abide in you, ask whatsoever you may wish, and it shall be done unto you.
043	JOH	015	008	In this my Father is glorified, that you may bear much fruit; and ye shall be my disciples.
043	JOH	015	009	As the Father loved me, I also loved you: abide in my love.
043	JOH	015	010	If you may keep my commandments, abide in my love; as I have kept the commandments of my Father, and I abide in His love.
043	JOH	015	011	I have spoken these things to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full.
043	JOH	015	012	This is my commandment, that you may love one another, as I loved you.
043	JOH	015	013	No one has greater love than this, that he may lay down his soul for his friends.
043	JOH	015	014	You are my friends, if you may do those things which I command you.
043	JOH	015	015	No longer do I call you servants; because the servant knows not what his lord is doing: but I have called you friends; because all things which I heard with my Father, I made known unto you.
043	JOH	015	016	You did not choose me, but I chose you, and placed you in your position, that you may go forth and bear fruit, and your fruit may abide: in order that He may give you whatsoever you may ask in my name.
043	JOH	015	017	I command these things unto you, that you must love one another with divine love.
043	JOH	015	018	If the world hates you, know that it first hated me.
043	JOH	015	019	If you were of the world, the world would love its own: but because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, on this account the world hates you.
043	JOH	015	020	Remember the word which I spoke to you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they persecuted me, they will persecute you; if they kept my word, they will also keep yours.
043	JOH	015	021	But they will do all these things to you on account of my name, because they do not know Him that sent me.
043	JOH	015	022	If I did not come and speak to them, they had not sin: now they have no excuse for their sin.
043	JOH	015	023	The one hating me hates my Father also.
043	JOH	015	024	If I did not works among them which no other did: they had not sin: but now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father.
043	JOH	015	025	But in order that the word having been written in their law may be fulfilled, That they hated me gratuitously.
043	JOH	015	026	When the Comforter, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, may come, He will witness concerning me,
043	JOH	015	027	but you indeed are witnesses, because you are with me from the beginning.
043	JOH	016	001	I have spoken these things to you, that you may not be offended.
043	JOH	016	002	They will put you out of the synagogues: but the hour is coming, that every one killing you may think he is offering service to God.
043	JOH	016	003	And they will do these things, because they did not know the Father, nor me.
043	JOH	016	004	But I have spoken these things to you, that when the hour may come, you may remember them, that I did say them to you. But I said not these things to you from the beginning, because I was with you.
043	JOH	016	005	But now I go to Him that sent me; and no one of you asks me, Whither goest thou?
043	JOH	016	006	But because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.
043	JOH	016	007	But now I tell you the truth; it is profitable to you that I may go away. For if I go not away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I may go, I will send Him to you.
043	JOH	016	008	And having come, He will convict the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment.
043	JOH	016	009	Concerning sin indeed, because they do not believe on me; and concerning righteousness;
043	JOH	016	010	because I go to the Father, and you see me no more;
043	JOH	016	011	and concerning judgment, because the prince of this world has been condemned.
043	JOH	016	012	I have many things to say to you, but you are not able to bear them now.
043	JOH	016	013	But when He, the Spirit of truth, may come, He will guide you in all truth: for He will not speak from Himself; but so many things as He hears, He will speak: and will proclaim to you the things which are coming.
043	JOH	016	014	He will glorify me: because He will receive from mine, and proclaim them unto you.
043	JOH	016	015	And all things whatsoever the Father has are mine: therefore I said, that He takes from mine, and will proclaim them to you.
043	JOH	016	016	A little while, and ye see me no more; again a little while, and ye shall see me.
043	JOH	016	017	Then some of His disciples were saying to one another, What is this which He speaks to us, A little while, and you see me no more; and again a little while, and ye shall see me? and that I go to the Father?
043	JOH	016	018	Then they were speaking, What is this, Little while, of which He speaks? and we know not what He is talking about.
043	JOH	016	019	Jesus knew that they wished to ask Him, and said to them, You are seeking with one another concerning this, because I said, A little while, and you see me no more, and again a little while, and you shall see me?
043	JOH	016	020	Truly, truly, I say unto you, that you will weep and mourn, and the world will rejoice; you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy.
043	JOH	016	021	When a woman may bring forth she has sorrow, because her hour has come: but when the little child may be born, she remembers her suffering no more, for the joy that a man has been born into the world.
043	JOH	016	022	Therefore you indeed also now have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one taketh your joy from you.
043	JOH	016	023	And in that day you will ask of me nothing. Truly, truly, I say unto you, Whatsoever you may ask the Father, He will give it to you in my name.
043	JOH	016	024	Until now you have asked nothing in my name: ask, and you shall receive, in order that your joy may be full.
043	JOH	016	025	I have spoken these things unto you in parables; the hour comes, when I shall no longer speak to you in parables, but openly will I proclaim to you concerning the Father.
043	JOH	016	026	In that clay you shall ask in my name: and I do not say, that I will ask the Father for you;
043	JOH	016	027	for the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved me as a friend, and you have believed that I came out from God.
043	JOH	016	028	I came out from the Father, and have come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.
043	JOH	016	029	His disciples say; Behold, now you are talking openly, and speaking no parable.
043	JOH	016	030	Now we know that you know all things, and have no need that any one may ask you: in this we believe that you came out from God.
043	JOH	016	031	Jesus responded to them, Do you now believe?
043	JOH	016	032	Behold, the hour cometh, and is already come, that you must be scattered abroad, each one to his own place, and leave me alone: I am not alone, because the Father is with me.
043	JOH	016	033	I have spoken these things to you, in order that you may have peace in me. In the world you have tribulation: but take courage; I have conquered the world.
043	JOH	017	001	Jesus spoke these words; and lifting up His eyes to heaven, said, Father, the hour has come; glorify thy Son, in order that the Son may glorify thee:
043	JOH	017	002	as thou didst give Him authority over all flesh, in order that whatsoever thou hast given unto Him, He may give unto them eternal life.
043	JOH	017	003	But this is eternal life, that they know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou didst send.
043	JOH	017	004	I glorified thee upon the earth, having finished the work that thou hast given to me that I may do it.
043	JOH	017	005	And now, Father, glorify thou me with thyself with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.
043	JOH	017	006	I have manifested thy name, to the men whom thou didst give me out of the world. They were thine, and thou didst give them to me; and they have kept thy word:
043	JOH	017	007	now they know that all things so many as thou hast given to me are with thee:
043	JOH	017	008	because the words which thou didst give me I have given unto them; and they received them, and they know truly that I came out from thee, and they believed that thou didst send me.
043	JOH	017	009	I pray for these: I pray not for the world; but for those whom thou hast given me, because they are thine:
043	JOH	017	010	and all mine are thine, and thine are mine: and I have been glorified in them.
043	JOH	017	011	And I am no longer in the world, and they are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep them through my name whom thou hast given unto me, in order that they may be one, as we are.
043	JOH	017	012	When I was with them, I was keeping them in thy name whom thou hast given unto me. And I guarded them, and no one of them perished, except the son of perdition; that the Scripture may be fulfilled.
043	JOH	017	013	And now I come to thee; and speak these things in the world, that they may have my joy complete in themselves.
043	JOH	017	014	I have given unto them thy word; and the world hated them, because they are not of the world, as I am not of the world.
043	JOH	017	015	I do not pray that you may take them out of the world, but that you may keep them from the evil one.
043	JOH	017	016	They are not of the world, as I am not of the world.
043	JOH	017	017	Sanctify them through the truth: thy word is truth.
043	JOH	017	018	As thou didst send me into the world, I also sent them into the world:
043	JOH	017	019	and I sanctify myself in their behalf, in order that they may also be sanctified through the truth.
043	JOH	017	020	And I not only pray for these, but also for those believing on me through their word;
043	JOH	017	021	that they may all be one, as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be in us; that the world may believe that thou didst send me.
043	JOH	017	022	And I have given unto them the glory which thou hast given unto me; in order that they may be one, as we are one;
043	JOH	017	023	I in them, and thou in me, in order that they may be perfected into one; in order that the world may know that thou didst send me, and didst love them, as thou didst love me.
043	JOH	017	024	Father, that which thou hast given unto me, I wish that they may also be with me, where I am, in order that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given unto me: because thou didst love me before the foundation of the world.
043	JOH	017	025	Righteous Father, indeed the world does not know thee, but I know thee, and they know that thou didst send me;
043	JOH	017	026	I made known thy name to them, and will make it known; in order that the love with which thou didst love me may be in them, and I in them.
043	JOH	018	001	Jesus saying these things, went out with His disciples beyond the brook of Kidron, where there was a garden, into which He and His disciples came.
043	JOH	018	002	And Judas, the one having betrayed Him; knew the place: because frequently Jesus with His disciples resorted thither.
043	JOH	018	003	Then Judas, having taken a band and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, comes thither with lanterns and torches and arms.
043	JOH	018	004	Then Jesus, knowing all things which are coming on Him, came out, says to them, Whom do you seek?
043	JOH	018	005	They responded to Him, Jesus the Nazarene. Jesus says to them, I am He. And Judas also, the one having betrayed Him, stood with them.
043	JOH	018	006	Then when He said to them, I am He, they went back, and fell on the ground.
043	JOH	018	007	Then He again asked them, Whom do you seek? And they said, Jesus the Nazarene.
043	JOH	018	008	Jesus responded, I told you that I am He: if then you seek me, let these depart.
043	JOH	018	009	In order that the word which He spoke might be fulfilled, that, I have lost none of those whom thou hast given unto me.
043	JOH	018	010	Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear. And the name to that servant was Malchus.
043	JOH	018	011	Then Jesus said to Peter, Put thy sword in the scabbard: the cup which the Father gave me, shall I not drink it?
043	JOH	018	012	Then the band and chiliarch, and the officers of the Jews, took Jesus and bound Him.
043	JOH	018	013	And they led Him first to Annas; for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.
043	JOH	018	014	And Caiaphas was the one counseling the Jews, that it is profitable that one man die for the people.
043	JOH	018	015	And Simon Peter and the other disciples followed Jesus. And that disciple was known to the high priest, and came with Jesus into the court of the high priest.
043	JOH	018	016	And Peter stood without at the door. Then the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, came out and spoke to the porter, and led in Peter.
043	JOH	018	017	And then the maidservant porter says to Peter, Art thou not one of the disciples of this man? He says, I am not.
043	JOH	018	018	And the servants and officers, having made a fire; because it was cold; were standing by it, and warming. And Peter was standing with them, and warming.
043	JOH	018	019	Then the high priest asked Jesus concerning His disciples and concerning His teaching.
043	JOH	018	020	And Jesus said to him, I have spoken openly to the world. I always taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, where all the Jews come together; and I spoke nothing in secret.
043	JOH	018	021	Why do you ask me? ask those who have heard, what I said to them: behold, they know what I said.
043	JOH	018	022	And He speaking these things, one of the officers standing by gave Jesus a slap, saying, Do you thus answer the high priest?
043	JOH	018	023	Jesus responded to him, If I spoke wickedly, witness concerning the wickedness: but if beautifully, why do you smite me?
043	JOH	018	024	Then Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.
043	JOH	018	025	And Simon Peter was standing and warming: and they said to him, Art thou not one of His disciples? He denied, and said, I am not.
043	JOH	018	026	And one of the servants of the chief priest, being a kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off, says, Did I not see thee in the garden with Him?
043	JOH	018	027	Then Peter again denied, and immediately the cock crew.
043	JOH	018	028	Then they lead Jesus from Caiaphas to the judgment hall: and it was morning. And they did not come into the judgment hall, in order that they might not be polluted, but that they might eat the passover.
043	JOH	018	029	Then Pilate came out to them, and says, What accusation do you bring against this man?
043	JOH	018	030	They responded and said to him, If He were not an evil doer, we would not deliver Him to you.
043	JOH	018	031	Then Pilate said to them. You take Him, and judge Him according to your law. Then the Jews said to him, It is not lawful for us to kill any one.
043	JOH	018	032	In order that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which He spoke, signifying by what death He was about to die.
043	JOH	018	033	Then Pilate came again into the judgment hall, and asked Jesus, and said to Him, Art thou the King of the Jews?
043	JOH	018	034	Jesus responded, Do you speak this of yourself, or did others tell you concerning me?
043	JOH	018	035	Pilate responded, Whether am I a Jew? thine own nation and the chief priests delivered thee to me: what hast thou done?
043	JOH	018	036	Jesus responded, My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would fight for me, in order that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But now my kingdom is not from thence.
043	JOH	018	037	Then Pilate said to Him, Then, art thou not a king? Jesus responded, Thou says that I am king. Unto this I was born, and unto this I have come into the world, in order that I may bear witness to the truth. Every one being of the truth hears my voice.
043	JOH	018	038	Pilate says to Him, What is truth? And saying this, again he went out to the Jews, and speaks to them, I find no crime in Him.
043	JOH	018	039	There is a custom to you, that I release unto you one during the passover. Then do you wish that I may release unto you the King of the Jews?
043	JOH	018	040	Then they all again cried out, saying, Not Him, but Barabbas. And Barabbas was a robber.
043	JOH	019	001	Then Pilate took Jesus, and scourged Him.
043	JOH	019	002	And the soldiers having plaited a crown of thorns, placed it on His head, and put on Him a purple robe;
043	JOH	019	003	and came to Him and continued to say, Hail, King of the Jews! and they gave Him slaps.
043	JOH	019	004	Again Pilate went out, and speaks to them, Behold, I lead Him out to you, in order that you may know that I find no fault.
043	JOH	019	005	Then Jesus came out, bearing the thorny crown and purple robe. And he says to them, Behold, the man!
043	JOH	019	006	Then when the high priest and officers saw Him, they cried out, Crucify Him, crucify Him. Pilate says to them, You take Him, and crucify Him: for I find nothing criminal in Him.
043	JOH	019	007	And the Jews responded, We have a law, and according to law He ought to die, because He made Himself the Son of God.
043	JOH	019	008	Then when Pilate heard this word, he feared the more;
043	JOH	019	009	then he went again into the judgment hall, and speaks to Jesus, Whence art thou? And Jesus gave him no answer.
043	JOH	019	010	Pilate says to Him, Do you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you, and I have power to crucify you?
043	JOH	019	011	Jesus responded, Thou hast no power against me, unless it was given to thee from above: on this account the one having betrayed me to thee has the greater sin.
043	JOH	019	012	After this Pilate still sought to release Him: but the Jews continued to cry out, saying, If you release Him, you are not the friend of Caesar: every one making himself king speaks against Caesar.
043	JOH	019	013	Then Pilate hearing these words, led out Jesus, and sat down on the tribunal, in the place called Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.
043	JOH	019	014	And it was the preparation of the passover: and was about the sixth hour. And he says to the Jews, Behold, your King!
043	JOH	019	015	Then they cried out, Take Him away, take Him away, crucify Him. Pilate says to them, Shall I crucify your King? And the chief priests responded, We have no king but Caesar.
043	JOH	019	016	Therefore he then delivered Him to them that He should be crucified. Then they took Jesus and led Him away.
043	JOH	019	017	And He was bearing His cross. And He went out into a place called Calvary, which in Hebrew is called Golgotha.
043	JOH	019	018	They crucified Him there, and two others with Him, on this side and on that side, and Jesus in the midst.
043	JOH	019	019	And Pilate also wrote His title, and placed it upon the cross. And it was written, JESUS THE NAZARENE THE KING OF THE JEWS.
043	JOH	019	020	Then many of the Jews read this title: because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city: And it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Roman.
043	JOH	019	021	Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, Write not, King of the Jews; but that He said, I am the King of the Jews.
043	JOH	019	022	Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.
043	JOH	019	023	Then the soldiers, when they crucified Jesus, took His garments, and made them four parts, a part for each soldier; and the vesture. And the vesture was seamless, woven from the top throughout.
043	JOH	019	024	Then they said to one another, Let us not tear it, but let us gamble for it, whose it shall be. In order that the Scripture may be fulfilled, saying, They divided my garments among themselves, and upon my vesture they cast the lot. Then indeed the soldiers did these things.
043	JOH	019	025	And by the cross of Jesus stood His mother, and the sister of His mother, Mary the mother of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.
043	JOH	019	026	Then Jesus seeing His mother, and the disciple whom He loved, standing by, said to His mother; Woman, behold, thy son.
043	JOH	019	027	Then He says to the disciple, Behold, thy mother. And from that hour that disciple received her into his own home.
043	JOH	019	028	After this, Jesus seeing that all things are already perfected, in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled, says, I thirst.
043	JOH	019	029	Then a vessel was sitting by full of vinegar: and filling a sponge with vinegar and placing it on the hyssop, they brought it to His mouth.
043	JOH	019	030	Then when Jesus received the vinegar, He said, It is finished: and bowing His head, He gave up His spirit.
043	JOH	019	031	Then the Jews, in order that the bodies may not remain on the cross during the Sabbath, since it was the Preparation (for the day of that Sabbath was a high day), asked Pilate, that they might break their legs, and take them down.
043	JOH	019	032	Then the soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first one, and of the other one being crucified along with Him.
043	JOH	019	033	But having come to Jesus, when they saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs:
043	JOH	019	034	but one of the soldiers pierced His side through with the spear, and immediately blood and water came out.
043	JOH	019	035	And He having seen hath testified, and his testimony is true: and he knows that he speaks the truth, that you also may believe.
043	JOH	019	036	For these things took place, in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled, A bone of Him shall not be broken.
043	JOH	019	037	Again another Scripture says, They shall look on Him, whom they have pierced.
043	JOH	019	038	After these things, Joseph from Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but having been hidden on account of the fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take the body of Jesus. And Pilate permitted. Then he came and took the body of Jesus.
043	JOH	019	039	And Nicodemus also, the one having come at first to Jesus by night, came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.
043	JOH	019	040	Then they received the body of Jesus, and wrapped it in linens with aromatics, as is the custom to the Jews to embalm.
043	JOH	019	041	And there was in the place where He was crucified, a garden; and in the garden a new sepulcher, in which no one was ever yet placed.
043	JOH	019	042	Then on account of the Preparation of the Jews (because the sepulcher was near), they placed Jesus there.
043	JOH	020	001	On the first of the Sabbaths Mary Magdalene comes to the sepulcher early in the morning, it being yet dark, and sees the stone having been rolled from the sepulcher.
043	JOH	020	002	Then she runs, and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and says to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulcher, and we know not where they have placed Him.
043	JOH	020	003	Then Peter and the other disciple came out, and they were coming to the sepulcher.
043	JOH	020	004	And the two were running simultaneously: and the other disciple was running before more rapidly than Peter, and came first to the sepulcher.
043	JOH	020	005	John looking in sees the grave-clothes lying; and did not come in.
043	JOH	020	006	Then Simon Peter, following him, he came into the sepulcher; and sees the grave-clothes lying,
043	JOH	020	007	and the napkin, which was on His head, not lying with the grave-clothes, but separate in one place, having been rolled up.
043	JOH	020	008	Then the other disciple also came in, the one having come first to the sepulcher, and saw, and believed;
043	JOH	020	009	for they did not yet understand the Scripture, That it behooved Him to rise from the dead.
043	JOH	020	010	Then the disciples departed again to their own comrades.
043	JOH	020	011	And Mary was standing at the sepulcher without, weeping: then while she was weeping, she looked into the sepulcher;
043	JOH	020	012	and sees two angels sitting in white robes, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus lay.
043	JOH	020	013	They say to her, Woman, why do you weep? She says to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have placed Him.
043	JOH	020	014	Saying these words, she turned backward, and sees Jesus standing, and did not know that He is Jesus.
043	JOH	020	015	Jesus says to her, Woman, why are you weeping? whom are you seeking? She, thinking that He is the gardener, says to Him, Sir, if you have taken Him away, tell me where you have placed Him, and I will take Him.
043	JOH	020	016	Jesus says to her, Mary: she turning, says to Him in Hebrew, Rabboni, which is called Teacher.
043	JOH	020	017	Jesus says to her, Cling not to me; for I have not ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and tell them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and my God and your God.
043	JOH	020	018	Mary Magdalene comes proclaiming to the disciples, I have seen the Lord; and He spoke these things to her.
043	JOH	020	019	Then it being evening, on that day, on the first day of the week, and the doors being shut where the disciples were assembled, on account of the fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in their midst, and says to them, Peace be unto you.
043	JOH	020	020	And saying this, He shewed them His hands and His side. Then the disciples rejoiced, seeing the Lord.
043	JOH	020	021	And Jesus said to them again, Peace be unto you: as the Father hath sent me, I also send you.
043	JOH	020	022	And saying this, He breathed on them, and says to them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost.
043	JOH	020	023	Whose sins you may remit, are remitted unto them; whose sins you may retain, have been retained.
043	JOH	020	024	And Thomas, one of the twelve, the one called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.
043	JOH	020	025	Then the other disciples said to him, We have seen the Lord. And he said to them, Unless I may see the print of the nails in His hand, and thrust my finger into the place of the nails, and thrust my hand into His side, I will not believe.
043	JOH	020	026	And after eight days His disciples were again within, and Thomas was with them. Jesus comes, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you.
043	JOH	020	027	Then He says to Thomas, Bring hither your finger, and see my hands, and bring your hand, and cast it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.
043	JOH	020	028	Thomas responded and said to Him, My Lord and my God.
043	JOH	020	029	Jesus says to him, Because you have seen me, you have believed: happy are those not seeing, and believing.
043	JOH	020	030	Indeed then Jesus also did many other miracles in the presence of His disciples, which have not been written in this book;
043	JOH	020	031	and these have been written in order that you may believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God; and in order that believing you may have life through His name.
043	JOH	021	001	After these things, Jesus again manifested Himself to His disciples, at the Sea of Tiberias; and He thus manifested Himself.
043	JOH	021	002	Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael the one from Cana of Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of His disciples, were together.
043	JOH	021	003	Simon Peter says to them, I go to fish. They say to Him, We also go along with you. They went out, and entered into a ship, and that night caught nothing.
043	JOH	021	004	And it being now morning, Jesus stood on the shore: the disciples did not know that He is Jesus.
043	JOH	021	005	Then Jesus says to them; Little children, whether have you any meat? They respond to Him, No.
043	JOH	021	006	He says to them, Cast the net to the right side of the ship, and you will find: then they cast it, and were not able to draw it on account of the multitude of the fishes.
043	JOH	021	007	Then that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, He is the Lord. Then Simon Peter hearing that He is the Lord, girded on his fishing-cloak (for he was unclothed), and cast Himself into the sea:
043	JOH	021	008	and the other disciples came in the ship (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits), drawing the net of the fishes.
043	JOH	021	009	Then when they came to the land, they see fire lying, and fish and bread lying on it.
043	JOH	021	010	Jesus said to them, Take from the fishes which you now caught.
043	JOH	021	011	And Simon Peter came up, and drew the net to the land, full of a hundred and fifty-three large fishes: and there being so many yet the net was not broken.
043	JOH	021	012	Jesus says to them, Come, take breakfast. But no one of the disciples dared to ask Him, Who art thou? knowing that He is the Lord.
043	JOH	021	013	Jesus comes, and takes bread, and gives it to them, and fish likewise.
043	JOH	021	014	And this third time Jesus was already manifested to His disciples, having risen from the dead.
043	JOH	021	015	Then when they took breakfast, Jesus says to Simon Peter; Simon, the son of Jonah, dost thou love me with divine love more than these? He says to Him, Yes, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee as a friend. He says to him; Feed my lambs.
043	JOH	021	016	Again He says to him a second time, Simon, the son of Jonah, do you love me with divine love? He says to Him; Thou knowest that I love thee as a friend. He says to him; Shepherdize my sheeplings.
043	JOH	021	017	He says to him a third time; Simon, the son of Jonah, do you love me as a friend? Peter was grieved, because He said to him the third time, Do you love me as a friend? And he says to Him, Lord, thou knowest all things; and thou dost understand that I love thee as a friend. He says to Him, Feed my sheeplings.
043	JOH	021	018	Truly, truly, I say unto you, When you were young, you girded yourself, and walked about where you wished: but when you get old, you will reach forth your hands, and another will lead you, where you do not wish.
043	JOH	021	019	And He spoke this, signifying by what death he shall glorify God. And having spoken this, He says to him, Follow me.
043	JOH	021	020	And Peter turning sees the disciple, whom Jesus loved, following; who also leaned upon His breast in the supper, and said; Lord, who is the one having betrayed thee?
043	JOH	021	021	Then Peter seeing him says to Jesus; Lord, but what shall he do?
043	JOH	021	022	And Jesus says to him, If I wish him to tarry until I come, what is that to thee?
043	JOH	021	023	Then that word went out to the brethren that that disciple does not die. And Jesus did not say to him, that he does not die; but, If I wish him to tarry until I come.
043	JOH	021	024	This is the disciple witnessing concerning these things, and having written the same: and we know that his testimony is true.

# BOOK	044	ACT	Acts	Acts
044	ACT	001	001	Truly, I made the first history, O Theophilus, concerning all things which Jesus began both to do and to teach,
044	ACT	001	002	from the day on which, having given commandment through the Holy Ghost to the apostles whom He had chosen, He was received up.
044	ACT	001	003	To whom He also, after He suffered, manifested Himself alive in many testimonials, being seen by them forty days, and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God:
044	ACT	001	004	and being assembled together with them, He commanded them, Not to depart from Jerusalem, but to await the promise of the Father which ye heard from me;
044	ACT	001	005	that John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.
044	ACT	001	006	Therefore indeed having assembled, they asked Him saying, Lord, do you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?
044	ACT	001	007	He said to them; It is not your province, to know the times or seasons, which the Father placed in His own authority.
044	ACT	001	008	But you shall receive the power of the Holy Ghost having come upon you, and shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and all Judea, and in Samaria, and into the extremity of the earth.
044	ACT	001	009	And having spoken these words, they looking, He was taken up, and a cloud received Him from their eyes.
044	ACT	001	010	And while they were gazing up into the heaven, He going, and behold, two men stood by them in white garments, who also said,
044	ACT	001	011	Ye Galilean men, why stand you looking up into the heaven? this same Jesus, the One having been received up into the heaven, will so come in the manner in which you saw Him going up into the heaven.
044	ACT	001	012	Then they returned into Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, being a journey of a Sabbath day.
044	ACT	001	013	And when they came in, they went up into the upper room, where Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alpheus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James, were abiding.
044	ACT	001	014	They were all persevering of one accord in prayer along with the women, and Mary, the mother of Jesus, and His brothers.
044	ACT	001	015	And during those days, Peter standing up in the midst of the brethren, said (and the number of names were about one hundred and twenty),
044	ACT	001	016	Men, brethren, it behooved the scripture which the Holy Ghost predicted through the mouth of David concerning Judas, the one becoming leader to those arresting Jesus, to be fulfilled;
044	ACT	001	017	because he was numbered among us and received the lot of this ministry.
044	ACT	001	018	Then indeed he purchased a field by the reward of iniquity, and falling headlong, burst asunder in the middle, and all his bowels burst out;
044	ACT	001	019	which indeed was known to all those dwelling at Jerusalem, so that field, in their own dialect, is called Acheldamach; that is, field of blood.
044	ACT	001	020	For it has been written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let there be no one dwelling in it, and let another take his pastorate.
044	ACT	001	021	Therefore the men having come together with us all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in unto us and went out,
044	ACT	001	022	beginning from the baptism of John, until the day on which He was taken up from us, it behooveth one of these to be witness of His resurrection along with us.
044	ACT	001	023	And they nominated two, Joseph, called Barsabas who was called Justus, and Matthias.
044	ACT	001	024	And praying they said, Thou, O Lord, Heart-searcher of all, show up the one of these two, whom thou hast chosen
044	ACT	001	025	to receive the place of this ministry and apostleship from which Judas departed to go into his own place.
044	ACT	001	026	And they gave lots for them, and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.
044	ACT	002	001	And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all of one accord in the same place.
044	ACT	002	002	And suddenly there was a sound from heaven as of a mighty, rushing wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.
044	ACT	002	003	And there appeared unto them divided tongues, as of fire, and it sat upon each one of them;
044	ACT	002	004	and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.
044	ACT	002	005	And Jews were dwelling at Jerusalem, devout men from every nation, of those under the heaven;
044	ACT	002	006	and this report prevailing, the multitude came together and was confounded, because they were hearing them speaking each one in his own dialect.
044	ACT	002	007	And they were all astounded and marveled, saying, Are not all these who are speaking, Galileans?
044	ACT	002	008	And how do we hear each one in our own dialect in which we were born,
044	ACT	002	009	Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and those inhabiting Mesopotamia, Judea, and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,
044	ACT	002	010	indeed Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the regions of Libya which is beyond Cyrene, and Roman sojourners, both Jews and proselytes,
044	ACT	002	011	Cretans and Arabians, we hear them speaking the mighty works of God in our own languages.
044	ACT	002	012	And all were astounded and bewildered, saying one to another, What does this wish to be?
044	ACT	002	013	And others mocking, continued to say, that these people are full of fermented wine.
044	ACT	002	014	And Peter standing with the eleven, lifted up his voice and spoke to them: Judean men and all ye dwelling at Jerusalem, let this be known unto you, and know my words.
044	ACT	002	015	For these are not drunken, as you suppose; for it is the third hour of the day;
044	ACT	002	016	but this is that which has been spoken by the prophet Joel;
044	ACT	002	017	And it shall come to pass in the last days, says God, I will pour out from my Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams;
044	ACT	002	018	and upon my servants and my handmaidens I will pour out of my Spirit on those days, and they shall prophesy.
044	ACT	002	019	And I will give wonders in the heavens above, and signs on the earth beneath, blood and fire, and vapor of smoke.
044	ACT	002	020	The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great day of the Lord shall come.
044	ACT	002	021	And it shall come to pass, that every one who may call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
044	ACT	002	022	Israelitish men, hear these words, Jesus the Nazarene, a man having been demonstrated unto you from God by miracles, wonders and signs, which God did through Him in your midst, as yourselves know;
044	ACT	002	023	Him by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, having been delivered, you having nailed up, slew through the hand of lawless men;
044	ACT	002	024	whom God raised up, loosing the pangs of death, because it was impossible that he should be held by it.
044	ACT	002	025	For David says in reference to him, I foresaw my Lord always before me, because he is on my right hand, in order that I may not be moved.
044	ACT	002	026	Therefore my heart rejoiced and my tongue was glad, and my flesh shall indeed still rest in hope,
044	ACT	002	027	because thou wilt not leave my soul in Hades, nor suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.
044	ACT	002	028	Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt fill me with gladness with thy countenance.
044	ACT	002	029	Men, brethren, it is lawful to speak to you with boldness concerning the patriarch David, because he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.
044	ACT	002	030	Therefore being a prophet and knowing that God swore with an oath, that from the fruit of his loins One should sit upon the throne;
044	ACT	002	031	foreseeing he spoke concerning the resurrection of Christ, that He was not left in Hades, neither did His flesh see corruption.
044	ACT	002	032	This Jesus God raised up, whose witnesses we are.
044	ACT	002	033	Therefore on the right hand of God exalted, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, has poured out this which you both see and hear.
044	ACT	002	034	For David hath not ascended into the heavens, but he says, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,
044	ACT	002	035	until I may make thy enemies the footstool of thy feet.
044	ACT	002	036	Then let all the house of Israel assuredly know that God hath made this same Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.
044	ACT	002	037	And hearing, they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the other apostles, Men, brethren, what must we do?
044	ACT	002	038	And Peter said to them, Repent, and each one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ unto the remission of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
044	ACT	002	039	For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all who are afar off, so many as the Lord our God may call.
044	ACT	002	040	And with many other words did he testify and exhort them, saying, Be saved from this wicked generation.
044	ACT	002	041	Then indeed having received his word they were baptized, and on that day about three thousand souls were added unto them;
044	ACT	002	042	and they were persevering in the teaching of the apostles and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in prayers.
044	ACT	002	043	And fear came upon every soul; and many wonders and signs were wrought by the apostles in Jerusalem; and there was a great fear upon all.
044	ACT	002	044	And all those who believed were together and had all things common,
044	ACT	002	045	and they sold their possessions and personalities, and divided the same unto all, as each one had need.
044	ACT	002	046	And daily of one accord in the temple they were persevering; and breaking bread from house to house, they received their food with gladness and purity of heart,
044	ACT	002	047	praising God, and having favor unto all the people. And the Lord was daily adding to them those who were being saved.
044	ACT	003	001	And Peter and John went up into the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth.
044	ACT	003	002	And a certain man, being lame from his mother's womb was habitually carried, whom they placed daily at the gate of the temple called Beautiful, to ask alms of those entering into the temple;
044	ACT	003	003	who seeing Peter and John about to come into the temple, asked to receive alms.
044	ACT	003	004	And Peter along with John, fixing his attention on him, said, Look unto us.
044	ACT	003	005	And he gave attention to them, expecting to receive something from them.
044	ACT	003	006	Peter said, Silver and gold do not belong to me; but I give thee that which I have. In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, walk about.
044	ACT	003	007	And taking him by the right hand he raised him up; and immediately the bottoms of his feet and his ankle-bones were strengthened.
044	ACT	003	008	And leaping out, he stood, and continued to walk around, and came into the temple with them, walking around and leaping, and praising God.
044	ACT	003	009	And all the people saw him walking round and praising God.
044	ACT	003	010	And they recognized him, that he was the one sitting for alms at Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were filled with astonishment and delight at that which had happened to him.
044	ACT	003	011	And he holding on to Peter and John; all the people ran together to them in the porch called Solomon's, exceedingly astonished.
044	ACT	003	012	And Peter seeing them, responded to the people; Israelitish men, why are you astonished at this, or why do you look upon us as having by our own power or holiness, made this man to walk about?
044	ACT	003	013	The God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, and the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Child, Jesus, who you indeed delivered up and denied before the face of Pilate having decided to release Him.
044	ACT	003	014	And you denied the Holy and Righteous One, and ask that a man who was a murderer should be delivered unto you,
044	ACT	003	015	and you slew the Prince of life, whom God raised from the dead, whose witnesses we are.
044	ACT	003	016	And through the faith of his name, his name hath made sound this one who you see and know, and through him faith has given unto him this soundness, in the presence of you all.
044	ACT	003	017	And now, brethren, I know that you did it through ignorance, as did your rulers also;
044	ACT	003	018	and those things which God proclaimed through the mouth of all the prophets that his Christ should suffer, he hath thus fulfilled.
044	ACT	003	019	Repent, therefore, and turn, that your sins may be blotted out, in order that seasons of soul-renewing may come from the presence of the Lord,
044	ACT	003	020	and he may send forth Jesus, who has been preached unto you as the Christ,
044	ACT	003	021	whom it behooves heaven indeed to receive until the times of the restitution of all things which God spoke through the mouth of all his prophets from the beginning.
044	ACT	003	022	Moses indeed said; The Lord our God will raise up to you from your brethren a prophet like unto me; Him you will hear concerning all things so many as he may speak to you.
044	ACT	003	023	And it shall come to pass, that every soul whosoever will not hear that prophet, shall be cut off from the people.
044	ACT	003	024	And indeed all the prophets from Samuel and consecutively, so many as spoke, also proclaimed these days.
044	ACT	003	025	Ye are the sons of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, In thy seed shall the families of the earth be truly blessed.
044	ACT	003	026	To you God, having first raised up his Son, sent him blessing you, in turning each one from your sins.
044	ACT	004	001	And they speaking to the people, the priests and captain of the temple and the Sadducees rose up against them,
044	ACT	004	002	being grieved because they were teaching the people and preaching the resurrection of the dead through Jesus;
044	ACT	004	003	and they laid hands on them and put them in prison till the morrow; for it was already evening.
044	ACT	004	004	And many of those hearing the word believed, and the number of men was about five thousand.
044	ACT	004	005	And it came to pass on the morrow, the rulers and elders and scribes
044	ACT	004	006	assembled in Jerusalem, and Annas the high priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander, and so many as were of the family of the high priest.
044	ACT	004	007	And having set them in the midst, asked them, By what power or in what name have you done this?
044	ACT	004	008	Then Peter being full of the Holy Spirit said to them, Ye rulers of the people and elders,
044	ACT	004	009	if we are this day judged for the benefaction of the impotent man, by whom he has been saved,
044	ACT	004	010	let it be known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ, the Nazarene whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, through him this man now stands sound in your presence.
044	ACT	004	011	This is the stone rejected by your builders, which has become the head of the corner.
044	ACT	004	012	And there is salvation in no other; for there is no other name given under heaven among men by which it behooveth us to he saved.
044	ACT	004	013	And seeing the boldness of Peter and John, and apprehending that they are unlearned and ignorant men, they continued to be astonished, and recognized them, that they were with Jesus;
044	ACT	004	014	and seeing the man who had been healed standing with them, they had nothing to say against it.
044	ACT	004	015	And having commanded them to depart out from the assembly, they conferred with one another,
044	ACT	004	016	saying, What can we do to these men? for that a notable miracle has been wrought by them is indeed manifest to all dwelling at Jerusalem, and we are not able to deny it;
044	ACT	004	017	but that it may extend no further unto the people, let us threaten them to speak no more in this name to any one of men.
044	ACT	004	018	And having called them, they command them, not at all to speak or teach in the name of Jesus.
044	ACT	004	019	And Peter and John responding said to them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to hearken unto you rather than God, judge ye;
044	ACT	004	020	for we are not able not to speak those things which we have seen and heard.
044	ACT	004	021	And they having threatened them, in addition sent them away, finding nothing to the end that they can punish them, on account of the people, because all continued to glorify God over that which had taken place;
044	ACT	004	022	for the man on whom this miracle of healing was wrought was more than forty years old.
044	ACT	004	023	And having been released they came to their own people, and proclaimed so many things as the chief priests and elders said to them.
044	ACT	004	024	And having heard, they unanimously lifted up their voice to God, and said, O Lord, thou having created the heaven and the earth and the sea and all things which are in them,
044	ACT	004	025	the One speaking through the mouth of David, thy child, our father through the Holy Ghost, Wherefore did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?
044	ACT	004	026	The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and his Christ.
044	ACT	004	027	For in truth they were assembled together in this city, against thy holy Child Jesus, whom thou didst anoint; both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel,
044	ACT	004	028	to do so many things as thy hand and thy counsel did foreordain to come to pass.
044	ACT	004	029	And now, Lord, look upon their threats and grant to thy servants with all boldness to speak thy word,
044	ACT	004	030	while, reaching forth thy hand unto healings, both miracles and wonders are wrought through the name of thy holy child Jesus.
044	ACT	004	031	And they praying, the place in which they were assembled was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and continued to speak the word of God with boldness.
044	ACT	004	032	And of the multitude who believed there was one heart and soul, and no one was saying that any of those things which belonged to him were his own, but all things were common to them.
044	ACT	004	033	And with great power the apostles continued to give witness of the resurrection of Jesus Christ the Lord; and great grace was upon them all.
044	ACT	004	034	For no one among them was in need; for so many possessions of lands or houses as belonged to them, selling, they were bringing the prices of the things having been sold,
044	ACT	004	035	and laying them at the feet of the apostles; and it was distributed to each as any one had need.
044	ACT	004	036	And Joseph called Barnabas by the apostles, which is interpreted, Son of consolation, a Levite, a Cyprian by race,
044	ACT	004	037	a farm belonging to him, having sold it, he brought the money and laid it at the feet of the apostles.
044	ACT	005	001	And a certain man, Ananias by name, with Sapphira his wife, sold an estate
044	ACT	005	002	and kept back a part from the price, his wife knowing it along with him; and having brought a certain part, laid it at the feet of the apostles.
044	ACT	005	003	But Peter said, Ananias, wherefore hath Satan filled thy heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and keep back a part from the price of the land?
044	ACT	005	004	Remaining with thee did it not belong to thee; and having been sold, was it not still in thy control? why hast thou placed this thing in thy heart? thou hast not lied to men, but to God.
044	ACT	005	005	And Ananias hearing these words, having fallen down, breathed out his soul. And great fear came on all hearing;
044	ACT	005	006	and the young men, rising up, took him, and having carried him out, buried him.
044	ACT	005	007	And an interval of about three hours supervened, and his wife, not having known what had taken place, came in.
044	ACT	005	008	And Peter responded to her, Tell me if you sold the place for so much? And she said; Yes, for so much.
044	ACT	005	009	And Peter said to her; Why has it been agreed with you to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of those having buried thy husband are at the door, and they will carry thee out.
044	ACT	005	010	And immediately she fell at his feet, and breathed out her soul; and the young men having come in found her dead, and having carried her out, buried her with her husband.
044	ACT	005	011	And great fear came on all the church, and on all those hearing these things.
044	ACT	005	012	And many miracles and wonders were wrought by the hands of the apostles among the people. And they were all of one accord in Solomon's porch.
044	ACT	005	013	And no one of the rest dared to attach himself to them; but the people were magnifying them;
044	ACT	005	014	but believers were the more added to the Lord, a multitude both of men and women,
044	ACT	005	015	so that they were carrying the sick into the streets, and placing them on couches and beds, in order that the shadow of Peter passing along might cast a shadow on some one of them.
044	ACT	005	016	Then a multitude, of the cities around about Jerusalem, came together, carrying their sick and those tormented by unclean spirits, who were all being healed.
044	ACT	005	017	And the high priest and all those being with him, being the sect of the Sadducees, were filled with rage,
044	ACT	005	018	and laid hands on the apostles, and placed them in the public prison.
044	ACT	005	019	And the angel of the Lord, having opened the doors of the prison during the night, and leading them out said,
044	ACT	005	020	Go, and standing in the temple, speak to the people all the words of this life.
044	ACT	005	021	And hearing, they came into the temple at daydawn, and were teaching. And the high priest coming and those with him, called together the sanhedrim and all the eldership of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to bring them.
044	ACT	005	022	And the officers arriving found them not in the prison; and having returned, reported,
044	ACT	005	023	saying; We found the prison closed with all safety, and the guards standing at the doors, and having opened, we found no one within.
044	ACT	005	024	And when the captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard these words, they were at a loss concerning them, what this might be.
044	ACT	005	025	And a certain one coming announced to them, Behold, the men whom you placed in the prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people.
044	ACT	005	026	Then the captain along with the officers, having gone away, led them, not with violence, for they feared the people lest they might be stoned.
044	ACT	005	027	And leading them, they placed them in the council, and the chief priests asked them, saying,
044	ACT	005	028	With commandment we commanded you not to teach in this name; and behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching; and you are determined to bring upon us the blood of this man.
044	ACT	005	029	But Peter and the apostles responding said, It behooves us to obey God rather than men.
044	ACT	005	030	The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you have slain, hanging him on the wood;
044	ACT	005	031	Him hath God exalted at His own right hand, a Prince and a Savior, to give repentance and remission of sins to Israel.
044	ACT	005	032	And we are witnesses of these words, and the Holy Ghost, whom God has given to those who obey him.
044	ACT	005	033	And hearing, they were cut through and were minded to kill them.
044	ACT	005	034	But a certain Pharisee, Gamaliel by name, a teacher of the law, honorable to all the people, rising in the sanhedrim command them to put the men out for a short time,
044	ACT	005	035	and he said to them; Israelitish men, take heed to yourselves in reference to these men what you are about to do.
044	ACT	005	036	For before these days Theudas arose, saying that he was somebody, to whom a number of men, about four hundred, adhered, who were slain, and all, so many as confided in him, were dispersed, and came to nothing.
044	ACT	005	037	After him Judas the Galilean arose, in the days of the enrollment, and led the people after him; he also perished, and all, so many as confided in him, were scattered abroad.
044	ACT	005	038	And I now say this to you: Stand aloof from these men, and let them alone; for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to naught;
044	ACT	005	039	but if it be of God, you will not be able to destroy them, lest perchance you may also be found fighting against God.
044	ACT	005	040	And they obeyed him, and having called the apostles, beating them, they commanded them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and sent them away.
044	ACT	005	041	Then they departed from the face of the sanhedrim, rejoicing indeed, because they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the sake of his name.
044	ACT	005	042	And all day in the temple, and from house to house, they ceased not teaching and preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ.
044	ACT	006	001	And during those days, the disciples multiplying, there was a murmuring of the Hellenists against the Hebrews, that their widows were being neglected in the daily ministration.
044	ACT	006	002	And the twelve calling to them the multitude of the disciples, said, It is not pleasing that we, leaving the word of God, serve tables.
044	ACT	006	003	But brethren, look out seven men from you of good report, full of the Spirit and wisdom, whom we shall appoint over this interest;
044	ACT	006	004	and we will give our attention to prayer and the ministry of the word.
044	ACT	006	005	And the word was pleasing before all the multitude, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas,
044	ACT	006	006	the Antiochian proselyte, whom they placed before the apostles, and having prayed, they placed their hands on them.
044	ACT	006	007	And the word of God increased, and the number of the disciples multiplied exceedingly in Jerusalem, and a great multitude of the priests were obedient unto the faith.
044	ACT	006	008	And Stephen, full of grace and power, was doing great wonders and miracles among the people.
044	ACT	006	009	And certain ones of the synagogues, called Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and those from Cilicia and Asia, stood up disputing with Stephen,
044	ACT	006	010	and they were not able to resist the wisdom and spirit with which he was speaking.
044	ACT	006	011	Then they bribed men, saying, that we have heard him speaking words blasphemous against Moses and God.
044	ACT	006	012	And they excited the people and the elders and scribes, and coming upon him, seized him, and led him into the council,
044	ACT	006	013	and they raised up false witnesses, saying, This man does not cease speaking words against this holy place and the law;
044	ACT	006	014	for we have heard him saying, that this Jesus the Nazarene will destroy this place, and change the customs which Moses delivered unto us.
044	ACT	006	015	And all sitting in the council, having fixed their eyes on him, saw his face as the face of an angel.
044	ACT	007	001	And the high priests said; Are these things so?
044	ACT	007	002	And he said, Men, brothers and fathers, hear ye; The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, while he was in Mesopotamia, before he migrated into Haran, and He said to him;
044	ACT	007	003	Come out from thy country and from thy kindred, and come hither into the land which I will show unto thee.
044	ACT	007	004	And after his father died he migrated himself thence into this country in which you now dwell,
044	ACT	007	005	and God gave him no inheritance in it, not the step of his foot; and he promised to give it to him, and his seed after him, for an inheritance, there being no child to him.
044	ACT	007	006	And thus God spoke, that his seed shall sojourn in a strange land, and they will enslave it and oppress it four hundred years.
044	ACT	007	007	And the nation whom they shall serve I will judge, says God, and after these things they shall come out and serve me in this place.
044	ACT	007	008	And He gave him the covenant of circumcision; and so he begat Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac, Jacob; and Jacob, the twelve patriarchs.
044	ACT	007	009	And the patriarchs, envying Joseph, sold him into Egypt:
044	ACT	007	010	and God was with him, and delivered him out of all his troubles, and gave him grace and wisdom before Pharaoh the king of Egypt; and he placed him governor over Egypt and all his house.
044	ACT	007	011	And the famine came into all the land and Canaan, and great distress: and our fathers found no sustenance.
044	ACT	007	012	And Jacob hearing that there is food in Egypt, sent away our fathers first.
044	ACT	007	013	And the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren, and his race became manifest to Pharaoh.
044	ACT	007	014	And Joseph sending, called to him Jacob his father, and all the family, seventy-five souls.
044	ACT	007	015	And Jacob went down into Egypt, and he and our fathers died there.
044	ACT	007	016	And they were carried over into Shechem, and buried in a tomb which Abraham purchased from the sons of Emmor in Shechem with a sum of money.
044	ACT	007	017	When the time of the promise which God made with Abraham drew nigh, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt,
044	ACT	007	018	until another king arose over Egypt, who knew not Joseph.
044	ACT	007	019	He dealing fraudulently with our race, afflicted our fathers, that they should expose their infants, so that they should not live.
044	ACT	007	020	During which time Moses was born, and was beautiful to God; who was kept three months in the house of his father.
044	ACT	007	021	And he being exposed, the daughter of Pharaoh took him, and adopted him for a son to herself.
044	ACT	007	022	And Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians; and was mighty in his words and works.
044	ACT	007	023	And when the time of the fortieth year was fulfilled to him, it came into his heart to visit his brethren, the children of Israel.
044	ACT	007	024	And seeing a certain one suffering affliction, he interposed, and executed vengeance in behalf of the oppressed one, slaying the Egyptian.
044	ACT	007	025	And he supposed that his brethren would understand that God through his hand is giving them salvation: but they did not recognize it.
044	ACT	007	026	On the following day, he appeared to them fighting, and undertook to reduce them to peace, saying, Men, you are brethren; therefore do not injure one another.
044	ACT	007	027	And the one injuring his neighbor thrust him away, saying, Who appointeth you a leader and a judge over us?
044	ACT	007	028	whether do you wish to kill me, in the manner in which you slew the Egyptian yesterday?
044	ACT	007	029	And at this word Moses fled, and became a sojourner in the land of Midia, where he begat two sons.
044	ACT	007	030	And forty years having passed away, an angel appeared to him in the desert of Mount Sinai in the flame of fire of the bramble bush.
044	ACT	007	031	And Moses, seeing the sight, was astonished: and he coming nigh to investigate, the voice of the Lord came:
044	ACT	007	032	I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob. And Moses trembling, did not dare to investigate.
044	ACT	007	033	And the Lord said to him, Loose the sandal of thy feet: for the place on which thou standest is holy ground.
044	ACT	007	034	Seeing, I have seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and heard their groaning, and have come down to deliver them. And come now, I will send thee into Egypt.
044	ACT	007	035	And this Moses whom they denied, saying, Who hath established thee a ruler and a judge? him hath God sent a ruler and deliverer, with the hand of an angel having appeared unto him in a bush.
044	ACT	007	036	He led them out, doing wonders and miracles in the land of Egypt, and in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness forty years.
044	ACT	007	037	This Moses is the one having said to the sons of Israel, A prophet will God raise up to you of your brethren, like unto me.
044	ACT	007	038	And this is the one being in the church in the wilderness with the angel speaking to him in Mount Sinai, and with our fathers: who received the living oracles to give unto us;
044	ACT	007	039	to whom our fathers were not willing to be obedient, but thrust him away, and turned back in their hearts towards Egypt,
044	ACT	007	040	saying to Aaron, Make us gods who shall go before us: for this Moses, who led us out from the land of Egypt, we know not what happened to him.
044	ACT	007	041	And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.
044	ACT	007	042	And God turned away, and gave them up to serve the host of the heaven; as has been written in the book of the prophets: Slain victims and sacrifices you have not brought unto me forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel.
044	ACT	007	043	And ye took up the shrine of Moloch, and the star of the god Remphan, images which you made to worship them; and I will transport you beyond Babylon.
044	ACT	007	044	And the tabernacle of testimony was with our fathers in the wilderness, as the one speaking to Moses commanded him to make it according to the example he had seen;
044	ACT	007	045	which our fathers receiving, brought in along with Joshua in the dispossession of the nations, whom God drove out, from the face of our fathers, until the days of David,
044	ACT	007	046	who found favor before God, and asked that he should build a tabernacle for the house of Jacob.
044	ACT	007	047	But Solomon built a house for him.
044	ACT	007	048	But the Most High dwelleth not in houses built with hands, as the prophet says,
044	ACT	007	049	Heaven is my throne, and earth the footstool of my feet: What house will you build for me? says the Lord; Or what shall be the place of my rest?
044	ACT	007	050	Hath not my hand made all of these things?
044	ACT	007	051	Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you do always resist the Holy Ghost; as your fathers did, so do ye.
044	ACT	007	052	Which one of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? and they slew those proclaiming concerning the coming of the Righteous One, whose betrayers and murderers you became:
044	ACT	007	053	who received the law in the administrations of angels, and did not keep it.
044	ACT	007	054	And hearing these words, they were cut through their hearts and gnashed their teeth at him.
044	ACT	007	055	But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, and looking up to heaven, saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,
044	ACT	007	056	and said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.
044	ACT	007	057	And crying out with a loud voice, they stopped their ears, and unanimously rushed on him,
044	ACT	007	058	and casting him out from the city, they began to stone him. And the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man, called Saul:
044	ACT	007	059	and continued to stone Stephen, calling upon the Lord, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.
044	ACT	007	060	And putting down his knees, he cried with a loud voice, Lord, do not impute this sin to them. And saying this, he fell asleep.
044	ACT	008	001	And Saul was consenting unto his death. And there was a great persecution in that day against the church in Jerusalem: and all were dispersed abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.
044	ACT	008	002	And godly men buried Stephen, and made great mourning over him.
044	ACT	008	003	But Saul was laying waste the church, entering into the houses, and arresting men and women, he committed them to prison.
044	ACT	008	004	Therefore indeed, being dispersed abroad, they went everywhere preaching the word:
044	ACT	008	005	and Philip, having gone down to the city of Samaria, was preaching Christ to them,
044	ACT	008	006	And the multitudes were unanimously giving heed to the things spoken by Philip, while they were hearing and seeing the miracles which he was performing.
044	ACT	008	007	For many of those having unclean spirits, roaring with a loud voice, went out: and many paralyzed and lame were healed;
044	ACT	008	008	and there was great joy in that city.
044	ACT	008	009	And a certain man, by name Simon, was formerly practicing magic in the city, and bewitching the nation of Samaria, saying that himself was some great man:
044	ACT	008	010	to whom all from small even unto the great gave heed, saying, This one is the power of God, called Great.
044	ACT	008	011	And they gave heed to him, because for a long time he had deceived them with his magic arts.
044	ACT	008	012	But when they believed Philip preaching the gospel concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.
044	ACT	008	013	But Simon himself also believed: and being baptized, was constantly with Philip, both seeing the miracles and the great dynamites performed, was astonished.
044	ACT	008	014	But the apostles in Jerusalem, having heard that Samaria has received the word of God, sent to them Peter and John:
044	ACT	008	015	who, having come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost.
044	ACT	008	016	For he had not yet fallen on any of them: but they were only baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
044	ACT	008	017	Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.
044	ACT	008	018	But Simon seeing that by the laying on of the hands of the apostles the Spirit was given, offered them money, saying,
044	ACT	008	019	Give me this power, that on whomsoever I may lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.
044	ACT	008	020	And Peter said to him, Thy silver be unto destruction with thee, because thou hast thought to obtain the gift of God with money.
044	ACT	008	021	There is neither part nor lot to thee in this word: for thy heart is not right before God.
044	ACT	008	022	Therefore repent of this thy wickedness, and pray the Lord, if perchance the thought of thy heart shall be forgiven thee;
044	ACT	008	023	for I see thou art in the gall of bitterness and the bond of iniquity.
044	ACT	008	024	And Simon responding said, You pray to the Lord for me, in order that none of these things of which you have spoken may come upon me.
044	ACT	008	025	Then indeed, witnessing and speaking the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.
044	ACT	008	026	And the angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Arise, and go towards the south unto the way going down from Jerusalem to Gaza; the same is desert.
044	ACT	008	027	And rising up, he departed. And, behold, an Ethiopian man, a eunuch, an officer of Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasury, had been to Jerusalem to worship,
044	ACT	008	028	and was returning, and sitting upon his chariot he was reading the prophet Isaiah.
044	ACT	008	029	And the Spirit said to Philip, Go, and join yourself to that chariot.
044	ACT	008	030	And Philip running forth, heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said; Whether do you understand what you are reading?
044	ACT	008	031	And he said, How could I, unless some one shall guide me? And he called upon Philip coming up, to sit with him;
044	ACT	008	032	and the place of the scripture which he was reading was this, He was led like a sheep to the slaughter; and as a lamb before the one shearing him is dumb, so he opens not his mouth.
044	ACT	008	033	In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare His generation? because his life is taken from the earth.
044	ACT	008	034	And the eunuch responding to Philip, said, I pray thee, concerning whom does the prophet speak this? concerning himself, or some other man?
044	ACT	008	035	Philip opening his mouth, and beginning from the same scripture, preached Jesus to him.
044	ACT	008	036	And while they were journeying along the road, they came to a certain water: and the eunuch says, Behold water; what doth hinder me from being baptized?
044	ACT	008	038	And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they both came down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.
044	ACT	008	039	And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more: for he went on his way rejoicing.
044	ACT	008	040	And Philip was found at Azotus: and going through he preached the gospel to all the cities, until he came to Caesarea.
044	ACT	009	001	But Saul, still breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, having come to the high priest,
044	ACT	009	002	asked from him letters to Damascus against the synagogues, in order that if he should find any being of the way, both men and women, he might lead them bound to Jerusalem.
044	ACT	009	003	And it came to pass, while prosecuting the journey he drew near to Damascus, suddenly a light from heaven shone around him;
044	ACT	009	004	and falling on the ground, he heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? And he said, Who art thou, Lord?
044	ACT	009	005	And He said, I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.
044	ACT	009	006	But stand up, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what it behooves thee to do.
044	ACT	009	007	And the men journeying along with him stood speechless, indeed hearing the voice, but seeing no one.
044	ACT	009	008	And Saul arose from the ground; and his eyes being open, he saw nothing: but leading him by the hand, they led him into Damascus;
044	ACT	009	009	and he was three days not seeing, neither did he eat nor drink.
044	ACT	009	010	And there was a certain disciple in Damascus, Ananias by name; and the Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.
044	ACT	009	011	And the Lord said to him, Arising, go to the street which is called Straight, and seek a Tarsean, by name Saul, in the house of Judas; for, behold, he is praying,
044	ACT	009	012	and he saw a man, Ananias by name, coming in, and putting his hands on him, in order that he may look up.
044	ACT	009	013	And Ananias responded, Lord I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to thy saints in Jerusalem:
044	ACT	009	014	and he here has authority from the chief priests to bind all those calling on thy name.
044	ACT	009	015	And the Lord said to him, Go: because he is a vessel of election to me, to bear my name both before the Gentiles, and kings, and sons of Israel:
044	ACT	009	016	for I will show him how many things it behooves him to suffer for my name's sake.
044	ACT	009	017	And Ananias departed, and came into the house: and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, Jesus, that appeared to you in the way in which thou didst come, hath sent me, that thou mayest look up, and he filled with the Holy Ghost.
044	ACT	009	018	And immediately there fell from his eyes as scales: and he looked up; and having stood up, was baptized,
044	ACT	009	019	and having received food, he was strengthened. And he was with the disciples who were in Damascus some days;
044	ACT	009	020	and immediately he was preaching Jesus in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.
044	ACT	009	021	And all those hearing were astonished, and continued to say, Is not this the one laying waste those calling on this name in Jerusalem? and has come hither for this, that he may lead them bound to the chief priests.
044	ACT	009	022	And Saul continued to be the more filled up with dynamite, and he was confounding the Jews dwelling in Damascus, proving that Jesus is the Christ.
044	ACT	009	023	And when many days were being filled up, the Jews issued a verdict to kill him:
044	ACT	009	024	but their plot was made known to Saul. And they were keeping the gates both day and night in order that they might kill him:
044	ACT	009	025	and his disciples taking him, let him down through the wall in the night, lowering him in a basket.
044	ACT	009	026	And arriving in Jerusalem, he was endeavoring to join himself to the disciples: and all were afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.
044	ACT	009	027	But Barnabas taking him, led him to the apostles, and related to them how he saw the Lord on the way, and that He spoke to him, and how he preached boldly in Damascus in the name of Jesus.
044	ACT	009	028	And he was with them going in and coming out in Jerusalem, preaching boldly in the name of the Lord;
044	ACT	009	029	and he was speaking and arguing against the Hellenists, and they undertook to kill him.
044	ACT	009	030	And the brethren, taking cognizance, led him to Caesarea, and sent him away to Tarsus.
044	ACT	009	031	Then indeed the church had peace throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria, being edified and progressing in the fear of the Lord; and was being multiplied by the exhortation of the Holy Ghost.
044	ACT	009	032	And it came to pass, that Peter going through all parts, came down also to the saints living at Lydda.
044	ACT	009	033	And he found there a certain man, by name Eneas, lying on a bed eight years, who was paralyzed.
044	ACT	009	034	And Peter said to him, Eneas, Jesus Christ heals thee: arise, and take up thy bed: and immediately he arose.
044	ACT	009	035	And all those dwelling at Lydda and Sharon, whosoever saw him, turned to the Lord.
044	ACT	009	036	But there was a certain disciple in Joppa, by name Tabitha, who being interpreted is called Dorcas: and she was full of good works and alms which she was doing.
044	ACT	009	037	And it came to pass during those days, she being sick, died: and washing her, they placed her in an upper chamber.
044	ACT	009	038	And Lydda being near to Joppa, the disciples hearing that Peter is in it, sent two men to him, entreating him, Do not delay to come unto us.
044	ACT	009	039	And Peter rising up came along with them; whom, on arrival, they led to the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and showing him the chitoons and himations, so many as Dorcas made, while with them.
044	ACT	009	040	And Peter having put them all out, and putting down his knees, prayed; and having turned toward the body, said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and seeing Peter sat up.
044	ACT	009	041	And having given her his hand, he raised her up, and calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive.
044	ACT	009	042	And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed on the Lord.
044	ACT	009	043	And it came to pass, that he remained some days in Joppa, with one Simon a tanner.
044	ACT	010	001	And a certain man in Caesarea, by name Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian,
044	ACT	010	002	devout, and fearing God with all his house, and doing many alms to the people, and praying to God always;
044	ACT	010	003	saw openly in a vision about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming to him and saying to him, Cornelius.
044	ACT	010	004	And he looking upon him, and being afraid, said, What is it, Lord? And he said to him, Thy prayer and thine alms have come up for a memorial before God.
044	ACT	010	005	And now send men to Joppa, and call for a certain Simon, who is called Peter:
044	ACT	010	006	he is lodging with a certain Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea.
044	ACT	010	007	And when the angel speaking to him went away, calling two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of those who waited on him continually;
044	ACT	010	008	and having related all things to them, he sent them away to Joppa.
044	ACT	010	009	And on the following day, they traveling, and drawing nigh the city, Peter went up on the house to pray about the sixth hour.
044	ACT	010	010	And he became hungry, and wished to eat: but they getting it ready, an ecstasy came on him,
044	ACT	010	011	and he saw the heaven open, and a certain vessel like a great sheet came down, and resting upon the earth with four rope ends:
044	ACT	010	012	in which were all quadrupeds, and creeping things of the earth, and birds of the heaven.
044	ACT	010	013	And a voice came to him, Arising, Peter, slay, and eat.
044	ACT	010	014	And Peter said, By no means, Lord, because I never was in the habit of eating anything unconsecrated and unclean.
044	ACT	010	015	And the voice again the second time came to him, Whatsoever things God has cleansed, do not count unclean;
044	ACT	010	016	and this took place the third time; and immediately the vessel was received up into the heaven.
044	ACT	010	017	And while Peter was at a loss within himself, as to what the vision he saw might be, behold, the men having been sent by Cornelius, making inquiry for the house of Simon, stood at the gate,
044	ACT	010	018	and having called, they were asking, if Simon, called Peter, lodges there.
044	ACT	010	019	And Peter meditating concerning the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, men are seeking thee;
044	ACT	010	020	but rising up, come down, and go with them, doubting nothing: because I have sent them.
044	ACT	010	021	And Peter having come down to the men, said, Behold, I am he whom you are seeking: what is the cause on account of which you are present?
044	ACT	010	022	And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a man righteous and fearing God, and being of good report by all the nation of the Jews, was warned by a holy angel to send for thee to come into his house, and to hear words with thee.
044	ACT	010	023	Then having called them in, he lodged them. And on the following day, rising up he went out with them, and certain ones of the brethren, who were from Joppa went along with him.
044	ACT	010	024	And on the following day they came into Caesarea; and Cornelius was expecting them, having called together his own relatives and near friends.
044	ACT	010	025	And when it came to pass that Peter was coming in, Cornelius meeting him, falling down at his feet, worshiped.
044	ACT	010	026	And Peter raised him up, saying, Stand up; I also am a man.
044	ACT	010	027	And conversing with him, he came in, and finds many having come together;
044	ACT	010	028	and he said to them, You know how it is an unlawful thing for a Jewish man to associate with, or come to one of another nation; and God has shown me not to call any man unconsecrated or unclean.
044	ACT	010	029	Therefore indeed, being sent for, I came unhesitatingly. Then I make inquiry for what word did you send for me?
044	ACT	010	030	And Cornelius said, From the fourth day until this hour, indeed the ninth, I was praying in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in shining apparel,
044	ACT	010	031	and says, Cornelius, thy prayer has been heard, and thine alms have been remembered before God.
044	ACT	010	032	Therefore send to Joppa, and call for Simon, who is called Peter. He is lodging in the house of Simon the tanner by the sea.
044	ACT	010	033	Then I immediately sent for thee; and thou hast done well being present. Now therefore we are all present before God, to hear all things which have been commanded thee of the Lord.
044	ACT	010	034	And Peter, opening his mouth, said, In truth I apprehend that God is no respecter of persons:
044	ACT	010	035	but in every nation the one fearing him, and working righteousness, is acceptable to him;
044	ACT	010	036	the word which he sent to the sons of Israel, preaching peace through Jesus Christ: he is Lord of all.
044	ACT	010	037	This word you know, which was throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;
044	ACT	010	038	Jesus, the one from Nazareth, how God anointed Him with the Holy Ghost and power: who went about doing good, and healing all oppressed by the devil: because God is with Him.
044	ACT	010	039	And we are witnesses in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they even slew, hanging him on the wood.
044	ACT	010	040	God raised him on the third day, and gave him to be made manifest;
044	ACT	010	041	not to all the people, but to the witnesses having been chosen of God, to us, who ate and drank along with him after He arose from the dead:
044	ACT	010	042	and He commanded us to preach to the people, and to witness that He is the One ordained of God the Judge of the living and the dead.
044	ACT	010	043	And to Him give all the prophets witness, that every one believing on him receives the remission of sins through His name.
044	ACT	010	044	Peter yet speaking these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all those hearing the word.
044	ACT	010	045	And the faithful ones who were of the circumcision, so many as came along with Peter, were astonished, because the gift of the Holy Ghost was poured out on the Gentiles also;
044	ACT	010	046	for they were hearing them speaking with tongues, and magnifying God.
044	ACT	010	047	Then Peter responded, Whether is any one able to forbid the water, that these shall not be baptized, whosoever received the Holy Ghost as we indeed?
044	ACT	010	048	And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to tarry some days.
044	ACT	011	001	But the apostles and brethren being throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also received the word of God.
044	ACT	011	002	And when Peter went tip to Jerusalem, those of the circumcision interviewed him, say
044	ACT	011	003	that, You went in unto men having uncircumcision, and ate with them.
044	ACT	011	004	And Peter beginning expounded unto them consecutively, saying,
044	ACT	011	005	I was praying in the city Joppa: and I saw a vision in an ecstasy, A certain vessel, like a great sheet, descending from the heaven, sitting down by four rope ends; and came even unto me:
044	ACT	011	006	into which looking, I was investigating, and I saw quadrupeds of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and the birds of the heaven.
044	ACT	011	007	And I also heard a voice saying to me, Arising, Peter; slay and eat.
044	ACT	011	008	And I said, By no means, Lord: because nothing unconsecrated or unclean has ever entered into my mouth.
044	ACT	011	009	And a voice a second time was heard from heaven, Whatsoever things God has cleansed, consider thou not unconsecrated.
044	ACT	011	010	And this took place three times: and all things were again taken up into the heaven.
044	ACT	011	011	And, behold, immediately three men were standing at the house in which we were, having been sent to me from Cornelius.
044	ACT	011	012	And the Spirit said to me, to go with them, doubting nothing. And these six brethren went along with me, and we entered into the house of the man.
044	ACT	011	013	And he proclaimed to us how he saw an angel standing in his house, and saying, Send to Joppa, and call for Simon, who is called Peter;
044	ACT	011	014	who will speak words to you, by which you and your whole family may be saved.
044	ACT	011	015	And when I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning.
044	ACT	011	016	And I remembered the word of the Lord, as He said, John indeed baptized with water; but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.
044	ACT	011	017	Since then God gave unto them the equal gift, as also unto us, believing on the Lord Jesus Christ; who was I, to be able to resist God?
044	ACT	011	018	And hearing these things, they acquiesced, and glorified God, saying, Then God has also given unto the Gentiles repentance unto life.
044	ACT	011	019	Then indeed those having been dispersed abroad on account of the persecution prevailing over Stephen came through even to Phoenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except Jews only.
044	ACT	011	020	And of them there were certain Cyprian and Cyrenean men, who, having come into Antioch, were speaking to the Greeks also, preaching the gospel of the Lord Jesus.
044	ACT	011	021	And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number having believed, turned to the Lord.
044	ACT	011	022	And the word was heard in the ears of the church in Jerusalem concerning them: and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.
044	ACT	011	023	Who, coming, and seeing the grace of God, rejoiced, and continued to exhort all, with purpose of heart to abide with the Lord:
044	ACT	011	024	because he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and faith. And a great multitude was added to the Lord.
044	ACT	011	025	And he went away to Tarsus, to hunt up Saul: and having found him, led him to Antioch.
044	ACT	011	026	And it happened unto them, a whole year indeed they assembled in the church, and taught a great multitude: and the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.
044	ACT	011	027	And during those days prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch.
044	ACT	011	028	And one of them by name Agabus, standing up, signified through the Spirit that there is about to be a great famine throughout the whole world: which took place under the reign of Claudius.
044	ACT	011	029	And they determined that each one of them should send to the ministry to the brethren dwelling in Judea, as each one of the disciples was prosperous;
044	ACT	011	030	and this they did, sending to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.
044	ACT	012	001	But at this time king Herod reached forth his hands to persecute some of those from the church.
044	ACT	012	002	And he slew James the brother of John with a sword.
044	ACT	012	003	And seeing that it is pleasing to the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also: and those were the days of the unleavened bread:
044	ACT	012	004	whom having seized, he also put in prison, having committed him to four quaternions of soldiers to guard him; wishing to bring him out to the people after the passover.
044	ACT	012	005	Then indeed Peter was kept in prison: but prayer to God in his behalf was incessantly made by the church.
044	ACT	012	006	But when Herod was about to lead him forth, and Peter was sleeping that night between two soldiers, and bound with two chains; and the guards were keeping guard before the door.
044	ACT	012	007	And, behold, the angel of the Lord stood over him, and a light shone in the house; and having touched the side of Peter, he raised him up, saying; Rise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.
044	ACT	012	008	And the angel said to him, Gird thyself, and put on thy sandals. And he thus did. And he says to him, Throw thy cloak about thee, and follow me.
044	ACT	012	009	And having come out, he was following; and did not know that it is true which was done by the angel; but he was thinking that he saw a vision.
044	ACT	012	010	And having come through the first guard and the second, they came to the iron gate leading into the city; which opened to them of its own accord: and having come out, they came on to the first street; and the angel immediately departed from him.
044	ACT	012	011	And Peter coming to himself, said, Now I know truly, that the Lord sent his angel, and delivered me out of the hand of Herod, out of all the expectation of the people of the Jews.
044	ACT	012	012	And recognizing his whereabouts, he came to the house of Mary, the mother of John, called Mark; where many were assembled and praying.
044	ACT	012	013	And he knocking at the door of the gate, a damsel, by name Rhoda, came to hearken:
044	ACT	012	014	and recognizing the voice of Peter, from joy did not open the gate, but running in, she proclaimed that Peter stands before the gate.
044	ACT	012	015	And they said to her, You are gone mad; but she persisted that it was so. And they said, It is his angel.
044	ACT	012	016	But Peter remained knocking: and having opened, they saw him, and were astonished.
044	ACT	012	017	And he, beckoning to them with his hand to keep silent, related how the Lord led him out from the prison: and said, Proclaim these things to James, and the brethren. And having gone out, he departed into another place.
044	ACT	012	018	And it being day, there was no small commotion among the soldiers, as to where Peter then was.
044	ACT	012	019	And Herod having sought him, and found him not, condemning the guards, commanded that they should be put to death; and having gone down from Judea to Caesarea, he tarried.
044	ACT	012	020	And he was very angry with the Tyrians and Sidonians: and they unanimously came to him, and having persuaded Blastus who was over the chamber of the king, they continued to seek peace; because their country is supported by the kings.
044	ACT	012	021	But on an appointed day, Herod, invested with his royal apparel, sitting on his tribunal, delivered a discourse to them:
044	ACT	012	022	and the people shouted, It is the voice of God and not of man.
044	ACT	012	023	And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not the glory to God; and being eaten by worms, he breathed out his soul.
044	ACT	012	024	And the word of the Lord increased and multiplied.
044	ACT	012	025	And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, having filled their ministry, taking with them John, called Mark.
044	ACT	013	001	And there were prophets and teachers in the church at Antioch; Barnabas, and Symeon called Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenean, and Manahem, the foster-brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
044	ACT	013	002	And they ministering to the Lord, and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Now separate unto me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.
044	ACT	013	003	Then they having fasted and prayed, and laid hands on them, sent them away.
044	ACT	013	004	Then they indeed, having been sent away by the Holy Ghost, came down to Seleucia; and thence sailed away to Cyprus.
044	ACT	013	005	And being in Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they also had John as their helper.
044	ACT	013	006	And having gone through the whole island to Paphos, they found a certain man, a magician, a Jewish false prophet, to whom was the name of Bar-Jesus:
044	ACT	013	007	who was with Sergius Paulus, the proconsul, an intelligent man. He, having called Barnabas and Saul, sought to hear the word of God;
044	ACT	013	008	but Elymas the magician (for thus his name is interpreted) opposed them, seeking to turn away the proconsul from the faith.
044	ACT	013	009	And Saul, (who is also Paul), being filled with the Holy Ghost, fixing his eyes on him,
044	ACT	013	010	said, O thou full of all guile and rascality, thou son of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease perverting the right ways of God?
044	ACT	013	011	And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a time. And immediately there fell on him a mist and darkness; and going about he was seeking people to lead him by the hand.
044	ACT	013	012	Then the deputy, seeing that which took place, believed; being delighted with the teaching of the Lord.
044	ACT	013	013	And those around Paul having sailed from Paphos, came into Perge of Pamphylia: and John having departed from them returned to Jerusalem.
044	ACT	013	014	And they having come from Perge, arrived into Picidian Antioch, and having come into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, they sat down.
044	ACT	013	015	And after the reading of the law and the prophets, the chief rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, Men, brethren, if there is any word of consolation to the people in you, speak.
044	ACT	013	016	And Paul, rising up, and beckoning with his hand said; Israelitish men, and those fearing God, hear.
044	ACT	013	017	The God of this people Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people during their sojourn in the land of Egypt, and with a strong arm led them out of it;
044	ACT	013	018	and when he supported them about the time of forty years in the wilderness,
044	ACT	013	019	and having destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them the inheritance of the land about four hundred and fifty years.
044	ACT	013	020	And after these things he gave them judges, till Samuel the prophet.
044	ACT	013	021	And then they asked for a king: and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, forty years;
044	ACT	013	022	and having deposed him, he raised up to them David for a king; to whom witnessing he also said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man according to my own heart, who will do all my wishes.
044	ACT	013	023	From whose seed according to the promise he led forth Jesus, the Savior, to Israel:
044	ACT	013	024	and John having preached the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel, before the face of his coming.
044	ACT	013	025	And when John fulfilled his course, he said, What do you consider me to be? I am not he: but, behold, there comes one after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to loose.
044	ACT	013	026	Men, brethren, sons of the race of Abraham, and those among you fearing God, unto us the word of this salvation was sent.
044	ACT	013	027	For those dwelling in Jerusalem, and the rulers, having rejected him, condemning him, have
044	ACT	013	028	fulfilled the voices of the prophets which are read every Sabbath; and having found no cause of death, asked Pilate that he should be executed;
044	ACT	013	029	and when they perfected all the things which had been written concerning him, taking him down from the cross, placed him in a sepulchre.
044	ACT	013	030	And God raised him from the dead;
044	ACT	013	031	who appeared to those coming up with him to Jerusalem from Galilee many days, who are now his witnesses to the people.
044	ACT	013	032	And we preach unto you the promise, which was made to the fathers,
044	ACT	013	033	that God has fulfilled this unto our children, raising up Jesus, as in the second Psalm it has been written, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.
044	ACT	013	034	And because he raised him up from the dead, no longer about to return to corruption, He has thus said, I will give unto you the faithful mercies of David.
044	ACT	013	035	Therefore He also says in another place, Thou wilt not suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.
044	ACT	013	036	For David, indeed having served his own generation according to the will of God, went to sleep, and did see corruption:
044	ACT	013	037	but he, whom God raised up, did not see corruption.
044	ACT	013	038	Then let it be known unto you, men brethren, that through this one remission of sins is preached:
044	ACT	013	039	and in him every one believing is justified from all things from which ye were not able to be justified by the law of Moses.
044	ACT	013	040	Then beware, lest the word which has been spoken by the prophets may come upon you;
044	ACT	013	041	Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and vanish away: because I work a work in your days, a work which you may not believe, though one may proclaim it to you.
044	ACT	013	042	And they going out, they continued to entreat them that these words should be spoken to them on the next Sabbath.
044	ACT	013	043	And the synagogue having been adjourned, many of the Jews and pious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who, speaking with them, continued to persuade them to abide in the grace of God.
044	ACT	013	044	And on the following Sabbath almost all the city came together to hear the word of the Lord.
044	ACT	013	045	And the Jews seeing the multitudes, were filled with jealousy, and contradicted the word spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.
044	ACT	013	046	And Paul and Barnabas speaking boldly, said, It was necessary that the word of God should first be spoken to you: since you have rejected it, and judge yourselves not worthy of eternal life, behold we now turn to the Gentiles.
044	ACT	013	047	For thus the Lord has commanded us, I have placed thee for a light of the Gentiles, that thou shalt be for salvation unto the extremity of the earth.
044	ACT	013	048	And the Gentiles hearing, rejoiced, and glorified the word of the Lord: and so many as had been ordained unto eternal life believed:
044	ACT	013	049	and the word of the Lord was carried throughout all the country.
044	ACT	013	050	And the Jews stirred up the noble godly women, and the first men of the city, and they raised a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them from their borders.
044	ACT	013	051	And having cast off the dust from their feet against them, they came into Iconium.
044	ACT	013	052	And the disciples were filled with joy, and the Holy Ghost.
044	ACT	014	001	And it came to pass in Iconium at this time, they came together into the synagogue of the Jews, and spoke in such a manner, that a great multitude both of the Jews and Greeks believed.
044	ACT	014	002	But the unbelieving Jews stirred up and poisoned the minds of the Gentiles against the brethren.
044	ACT	014	003	Then indeed preaching boldly in behalf of the Lord, witnessing to the word of His grace, giving signs and wonders to be wrought by their hands, they spent much time.
044	ACT	014	004	And the multitude of the city was divided: and some indeed were with the Jews, and some with the apostles.
044	ACT	014	005	And when there was a conspiracy of both Gentiles and Jews along with their leaders, to insult and stone them,
044	ACT	014	006	recognizing it, they fled into the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra, and Derbe, and the surrounding country;
044	ACT	014	007	and there they preached the gospel.
044	ACT	014	008	And there was a certain man sitting there in Lystra, impotent in his feet, being lame from the womb of his mother, who never did walk about.
044	ACT	014	009	He heard Paul speaking, who fixing his attention on him, and seeing that he had faith to be saved,
044	ACT	014	010	said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and continued to walk around.
044	ACT	014	011	And the multitudes seeing what Paul did, lifted up their voice, in Lycaonic, saying, The gods having assumed the likeness of men have come down to us:
044	ACT	014	012	and they were calling Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercury, since he was the leader of the speech.
044	ACT	014	013	And the priest of Jupiter, being in front of the city, having brought oxen and garlands to the gate, wished to offer sacrifices to them, along with the multitudes.
044	ACT	014	014	And the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, hearing, rending their garments, rushed into the crowd, crying out, and saying,
044	ACT	014	015	Men, why are you doing these things? We are also men of like suffering with you, preaching the gospel to you that you should turn from these vanities to the living God, who created the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all things which are in them:
044	ACT	014	016	who in bygone generations, suffered all nations to walk in their own ways;
044	ACT	014	017	indeed he did not leave himself without witnesses, doing good, giving to you the rains from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness.
044	ACT	014	018	And speaking these things they scarcely restrained the multitude from offering sacrifices to them.
044	ACT	014	019	But the Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and having persuaded the multitudes, stoned Paul, dragged him out of the city, thinking that he was dead;
044	ACT	014	020	but, the disciples having surrounded him, rising up, he came into the city. And on the following day he came with Barnabas into Derbe;
044	ACT	014	021	and preaching the gospel to that city, and making many disciples, they returned into Lystra, and into Iconium, and into Antioch,
044	ACT	014	022	strengthening the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to abide in the faith, and it behooves them through many tribulations to enter into the kingdom of God.
044	ACT	014	023	And electing elders for them in every church, praying with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they had believed.
044	ACT	014	024	And having come through Pisidia, they came into Pamphylia.
044	ACT	014	025	And having spoken the word in Perge, they came down into Attalia;
044	ACT	014	026	and thence they sailed away into Antioch, whence they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.
044	ACT	014	027	And arriving, and convening the church, they reported so many things as God did with them, and that He opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.
044	ACT	014	028	And they spent no small time with the disciples.
044	ACT	015	001	And certain ones having come down from Judea were teaching the brethren that, Unless you may be circumcised, according to the custom of Moses, you are not able to be saved.
044	ACT	015	002	And there being no small contention and disputation to Paul and Barnabas against them, they delegated Paul and Barnabas, and certain others of them, to go up to the apostles and elders in Jerusalem concerning this question.
044	ACT	015	003	Then indeed they having been sent away by the church, traveled through both Phoenicia and Samaria, relating the conversion of the Gentiles: and they continued to make great joy to all the brethren.
044	ACT	015	004	And arriving into Jerusalem, they were received by the church, and the apostles, and the elders, and they proclaimed so many things as God did with them.
044	ACT	015	005	And certain one of those from the sect of the Pharisees having believed arose up, saying that, It is necessary to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.
044	ACT	015	006	And the apostles and elders were convened to see about this problem.
044	ACT	015	007	And there being much disputation, Peter, having arisen, said to them, Men, brethren, you know that from ancient days God chose among you, that the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel through my mouth, and believe.
044	ACT	015	008	And God, who knows the heart, witnessed to them, giving to them the Holy Ghost, as also to us;
044	ACT	015	009	and made no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.
044	ACT	015	010	Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke on the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
044	ACT	015	011	But through the grace of our Lord Jesus, we believe that we are saved, in the same manner in which they are also.
044	ACT	015	012	And the whole multitude became silent, and continued to hear Barnabas and Paul, relating how many miracles and wonders God wrought among the Gentiles through them.
044	ACT	015	013	And after they became silent, James responded, saying, Men, brethren, hear me.
044	ACT	015	014	Symeon hath related how God in the first place interposed to take a people from the Gentiles, in His name.
044	ACT	015	015	And to this corresponds the words of the prophet; as has been written,
044	ACT	015	016	After these things I will return, and will build again the throne of David, which has fallen down; and will build again the ruins of the same, and will set it up again:
044	ACT	015	017	in order that the residue of men may seek out the Lord, even all the Gentiles, on whom my name has been called upon them, says the Lord, who doeth these things
044	ACT	015	018	known from the beginning.
044	ACT	015	019	Therefore I judge, that we should not burden those from the Gentiles turning to God:
044	ACT	015	020	but to command them to abstain from things offered to idols, and from fornication, and from strangulation, and from blood.
044	ACT	015	021	For Moses from ancient generations, has those preaching him in every city, being read in the synagogues on every Sabbath.
044	ACT	015	022	Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, along with the whole church, to send men chosen from them into Antioch along with Paul and Barnabas; Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, leaders among the brethren:
044	ACT	015	023	having written through their hand; The apostles and elders, brethren to the brethren who are from the Gentiles throughout Antioch and Syria and Cilicia greeting.
044	ACT	015	024	Since we heard that certain ones having come out from us troubled you, disturbing your souls with words which we did not command:
044	ACT	015	025	it seemed good to us, being of one accord, having chosen men to send them to you along with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
044	ACT	015	026	men who have imperiled their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
044	ACT	015	027	Therefore we have sent Judas and Silas, themselves also proclaiming the same things by speech.
044	ACT	015	028	For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no more burden than these necessary things,
044	ACT	015	029	to abstain from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which keeping yourselves, you will do well. Fare ye well.
044	ACT	015	030	Then indeed they, having been sent away, came down into Antioch, and convening the multitude, they delivered the letter.
044	ACT	015	031	And having read it, they rejoiced over the consolation.
044	ACT	015	032	Both Judas and Silas, themselves also being prophets, exhorted the brethren with elaborate speech, and strengthened them;
044	ACT	015	033	and having spent the time, they were discharged by the brethren with peace back to the apostles who sent them.
044	ACT	015	035	And Paul and Barnabas tarried in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, also along with many others.
044	ACT	015	036	And after many days Paul said to Barnabas, Having returned let us now visit the brethren in every city in which we preached the word of the Lord, how they are doing.
044	ACT	015	037	But Barnabas advised to take with them John, also called Mark.
044	ACT	015	038	But Paul thought that he would not take with them, him who having departed from them from Pamphylia, and not having gone along with them into the work.
044	ACT	015	039	But there was a paroxysm, so that they parted from one another, and Barnabas, taking Mark, sailed away into Cyprus.
044	ACT	015	040	And Paul, having chosen Silas, went out, committed to the grace of the Lord by the brethren;
044	ACT	015	041	and he traveled through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.
044	ACT	016	001	And he arrived into Derbe and Lystra. And, behold, a certain disciple was there, by name Timothy, the son of a faithful Jewish woman, and a Greek father,
044	ACT	016	002	who was of good report by the brethren in Lystra and Iconium.
044	ACT	016	003	Paul wished him to go out with him; and having taken him circumcised him on account of the Jews who were in those places: for they all knew his father that he was a Greek.
044	ACT	016	004	And while they were traveling through the cities, they delivered to them the decrees which were adjudicated by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem, to keep.
044	ACT	016	005	Then the churches were indeed strengthened in faith, and abounded in number daily.
044	ACT	016	006	And they traveled through Phrygia and the Galatian country, being prohibited by the Holy Ghost from speaking the word in Asia.
044	ACT	016	007	And having come opposite Mysia, they were endeavoring to go on into Bithynia, and the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them;
044	ACT	016	008	and having come through Mysia they descended into Troas.
044	ACT	016	009	And a vision was seen by Paul during the night: Some Macedonian man was standing and entreating him and saying, Having come over into Macedonia, help us.
044	ACT	016	010	And when he saw the vision, we immediately sought to depart into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.
044	ACT	016	011	And having embarked from Troas, we sailed directly to Samothrace, and on the following day into Neapolis,
044	ACT	016	012	and thence into Philippi, which is the first city of the Macedonian region, a colony. And we were in that city spending some days.
044	ACT	016	013	And on the Sabbath day we went out from the gate by the river, where we were accustomed that prayer should be, and having sat down, we spoke to the women having assembled.
044	ACT	016	014	And a certain woman Lydia by name, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, worshiping God, was hearing us: whose heart the Lord opened to give attention to the words spoken by Paul.
044	ACT	016	015	And when she and her household were baptized, she entreated us, saying, If you have found me to be faithful to the Lord, having come into my house, abide: and she constrained us.
044	ACT	016	016	And it came to pass, we going to the prayer, a certain damsel having a spirit of divination met us, who brought much gain to her masters telling fortunes.
044	ACT	016	017	She, following Paul and us, continued to cry out, saying, These men are the servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to us the way of salvation.
044	ACT	016	018	And she continued to do this many days. And Paul, being worn out, and turning round, said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out from her. And he came out the same hour.
044	ACT	016	019	And her masters seeing that the hope of their gain was gone, arresting Paul and Silas, dragged them into the forum to the rulers,
044	ACT	016	020	and leading them to the magistrates, said, These men do exceedingly trouble our city, being Jews,
044	ACT	016	021	and they proclaimed customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, or to do, being Romans.
044	ACT	016	022	And the crowd stood up together against them: and the magistrates tearing off their garments, commanded the lictors to beat them with rods.
044	ACT	016	023	And having laid many stripes on them, they cast them into prison, commanding the jailer to keep them safely:
044	ACT	016	024	who, having received such a charge, cast them into the interior prison, and fastened their feet into the wood.
044	ACT	016	025	But at midnight Paul and Silas, praying, continued to sing praises to God: and the prisoners heard them.
044	ACT	016	026	And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and all the doors were immediately opened, and the bonds of all were loosed.
044	ACT	016	027	And the jailer, being awakened, and seeing the doors of the prison open, seizing a sword, was about to kill himself, thinking that his prisoners had escaped.
044	ACT	016	028	But Paul shouted with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are here.
044	ACT	016	029	And having asked for a light, he sprang in, and being alarmed, he fell down before Paul and Silas,
044	ACT	016	030	and leading them out said, Sirs, what does it behoove me to do in order that I may be saved?
044	ACT	016	031	And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus, and thou and thy household shall be saved.
044	ACT	016	032	And they spoke to him the word of the Lord, along with all who were in his house.
044	ACT	016	033	And taking them that hour of the night, he washed the blood from their stripes; and he and his were baptized immediately:
044	ACT	016	034	and leading them into his house, he set a table by them, and rejoiced throughout his house, having believed in God.
044	ACT	016	035	But it being day, the magistrates sent the lictors, saying, Send away these men.
044	ACT	016	036	And the jailer proclaimed these words to Paul, The magistrates have sent word that you may be released: now therefore having gone out, depart in peace.
044	ACT	016	037	But Paul said to them, Having beaten us publicly uncondemned, being Roman men, they cast us into prison, and now do they cast us out privately? for no; but having come themselves let them lead us out.
044	ACT	016	038	And the lictors proclaimed these words to the magistrates. And hearing that they are Romans, they were alarmed;
044	ACT	016	039	and having come they called for them, and leading them out, requested them to go away from their city.
044	ACT	016	040	And having come out from the prison they came to Lydia, and seeing the brethren, comforted them, and departed.
044	ACT	017	001	And having traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came into Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.
044	ACT	017	002	And according to custom to Paul, he came in unto them, and for three Sabbaths he expounded unto them from the scriptures,
044	ACT	017	003	opening and proving, that it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead, and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is the Christ.
044	ACT	017	004	And certain ones of them were persuaded, and identified themselves with Paul and Silas, and of the pious Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.
044	ACT	017	005	But the Jews giving away to jealousy, and receiving to themselves certain wicked men of those around the forum, and raising a mob, continued to put the city in an uproar; and assaulting the house of Jason, they were seeking to lead them out to the people:
044	ACT	017	006	but not finding them, they dragged Jason and certain brethren to the rulers of the city, roaring that, These who have turned the world upside down are also come hither;
044	ACT	017	007	whom Jason has received: and all these are doing contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another King, Jesus.
044	ACT	017	008	And they excited the rabble and the city rulers hearing these things;
044	ACT	017	009	and having received satisfaction from Jason and the others they sent them away.
044	ACT	017	010	But the brethren immediately sent away both Paul and Silas to Berea by night, who coming into the synagogue of the Jews departed;
044	ACT	017	011	but these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, who received the word with all enthusiasm, searching the scriptures daily, if these things are so.
044	ACT	017	012	Then indeed many of them believed, and of the noble Greek women and men, not a few;
044	ACT	017	013	but when the Jews from Thessalonica knew that the word of God was preached by Paul in Berea, they came thither also, agitating and stirring up the rabbles.
044	ACT	017	014	But immediately at that time the brethren sent away Paul to travel even to the sea: and Silas and Timothy remained there.
044	ACT	017	015	But having embarked Paul, they led him even to Athens: and receiving commandment to Silas and Timothy that they should come to him as quickly as possible, they departed from him.
044	ACT	017	016	But Paul waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, seeing the city devoted to idolatry.
044	ACT	017	017	Then indeed he spoke to the Jews, and to the worshipers in the synagogue, and to those incidentally meeting him every day in the forum.
044	ACT	017	018	And certain ones of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers interviewed him, and some continued to say, What would this babbler wish to say? and others said, He seems to be the propagator of strange divinities: because he was preaching the gospel of Jesus, and the resurrection.
044	ACT	017	019	And taking him, they led him to the Areopagus, saying; Are we able to know what is this new teaching, spoken by thee?
044	ACT	017	020	For you bring certain strange things to our hearing: therefore we desire to know what these things wish to be.
044	ACT	017	021	But all the Athenians and itinerant strangers were accustomed to devote their time to nothing else, than to tell something new, or to hear something.
044	ACT	017	022	And Paul standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said, Athenian men, I perceive that in all things you are very religious.
044	ACT	017	023	For going through, and seeing your devotions, I also found an altar on which it was superscribed, To THE UNKNOWN GOD. Therefore I now preach unto you Him whom you are ignorantly worshiping.
044	ACT	017	024	God having made the world and all things which are in it, being himself Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands;
044	ACT	017	025	neither is he worshiped by human hands, as if needing something, Himself having given life, and breath, and all things to all;
044	ACT	017	026	and of (one) man he created every nation of men to dwell upon the whole face of the earth, having determined their predestinated times, and the boundaries of their habitation;
044	ACT	017	027	that they should seek God, if perhaps indeed they might feel after him, and find him, though not being far from each one of you.
044	ACT	017	028	For in him we live and move and have our being, as indeed certain ones of your own poets have said, For we are truly his offspring.
044	ACT	017	029	Then being the offspring of God, we ought not to think that divinity is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, the invention of art and the device of man.
044	ACT	017	030	Then indeed God winking at the times of ignorance, now commands all men everywhere to repent:
044	ACT	017	031	as He has appointed a day, in which he is about to judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he has ordained; giving faith to all, having raised Him from the dead.
044	ACT	017	032	And having heard the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: others said; We will hear thee concerning this even again.
044	ACT	017	033	So Paul went out from their midst.
044	ACT	017	034	But certain men, having adhered to him, believed; among whom was also Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman Damarias by name, and others along with them.
044	ACT	018	001	After these things having departed from Athens, he came to Corinth.
044	ACT	018	002	And having found a certain Jew by name Aquila, a Pontic by race, having recently come from Italy, and Priscilla his wife; because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome: he came to them:
044	ACT	018	003	and because they were of the same craft, abode with them, and they labored: for they were tentmakers by trade.
044	ACT	018	004	And he spoke in the synagogue every Sabbath, and persuaded both Jews and Greeks.
044	ACT	018	005	And when both Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was straitened with the word, witnessing to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ.
044	ACT	018	006	And they opposing, and blaspheming, shaking his garments, he said to them, Your blood be upon your own head; I am pure: from now I will go to the Gentiles.
044	ACT	018	007	And having departed thence, he came into the house of a certain Titus, Justus by name, worshiping God, whose house is joined to the synagogue.
044	ACT	018	008	But Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.
044	ACT	018	009	And the Lord spoke to Paul in the night through a vision, Fear not, but speak, and be not silent:
044	ACT	018	010	because I am with thee, and no man shall assault thee to hurt thee: because there is much people to me in this city.
044	ACT	018	011	And he spent a year and six months teaching the word of God among them.
044	ACT	018	012	But Gallio being proconsul of Achaia, the Jews of one accord arose up against Paul, and led him to the tribunal,
044	ACT	018	013	saying, This one persuades men to worship God contrary to law.
044	ACT	018	014	And Paul being about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If it were some injustice or wicked rascality, O Jews, I would bear with you according to reason:
044	ACT	018	015	but if there are questions about the words and name, and law appertaining to you, yourselves shall see to it; I do not wish to be judge of these things.
044	ACT	018	016	And he drove them away from the tribunal.
044	ACT	018	017	And all taking Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, beat him before the tribunal; and nothing of these things was a care to Gallio.
044	ACT	018	018	And Paul, still remaining some days, having bidden adieu to the brethren, sailed away to Syria, and along with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea; for he had a vow.
044	ACT	018	019	And they arrived in Ephesus, and he left them there: and himself, having gone into the synagogue, spoke to the Jews.
044	ACT	018	020	And they asking him to remain a longer time, he did not consent;
044	ACT	018	021	but having bidden them adieu; and saying, I will return unto you again, God willing; he embarked from Ephesus;
044	ACT	018	022	and having come into Caesarea, having gone up, and saluted the church, he came down to Antioch;
044	ACT	018	023	having spent some time, he went from them, traveling consecutively through the Galatian country and Phrygia, confirming all the disciples.
044	ACT	018	024	And a certain Jew, Apollos by name, an Alexandrian by race, an eloquent man, came into Ephesus, being mighty in the scriptures.
044	ACT	018	025	And he was instructed in the way of the Lord, and zealous in spirit, was speaking and teaching accurately the things concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John;
044	ACT	018	026	and he began to preach boldly in the synagogue. But Priscilla and Aquila, having heard him, took him to themselves, and expounded unto him the way of the Lord more perfectly.
044	ACT	018	027	And he wishing to go into Achaia, the brethren having sent him forth wrote to the disciples to receive him. Who, being present, conferred much on those having believed through grace.
044	ACT	018	028	For he vehemently argued down the Jews, publicly, showing through the scriptures that Jesus is the Christ.
044	ACT	019	001	And it came to pass, while Apollos was in Corinth, Paul having come through the upper regions came down into Ephesus: and found certain disciples,
044	ACT	019	002	and said to them, Have you received the Holy Ghost, having believed? And they said to him, But we have not heard if the Holy Ghost is (given).
044	ACT	019	003	And he said, Into what then were you baptized? And they said, Into the baptism of John.
044	ACT	019	004	And Paul said, John baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on the one coming after him, that is Jesus.
044	ACT	019	005	And they, having heard, were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus;
044	ACT	019	006	and Paul having laid his hands on them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they continued to speak with tongues, and prophesy.
044	ACT	019	007	And they were all about twelve men.
044	ACT	019	008	And having come into the synagogue, he preached boldly three months, expounding and persuading them as to the things concerning the kingdom of God.
044	ACT	019	009	But when some were becoming hardened and disbelieving, speaking evil of the way in the presence of the multitude, departing from them he separated his disciples, daily expounding in the school of Tyrannus.
044	ACT	019	010	And this took place two years; so that all dwelling in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.
044	ACT	019	011	And God was working great miracles through the hands of Paul;
044	ACT	019	012	so that napkins and aprons were carried from his body and placed on the sick, and diseases departed from them, and evil spirits went out of them.
044	ACT	019	013	And certain ones of the itinerant Jewish exorcists undertook to call the name of the Lord Jesus, over those having evil spirits saying, I adjure you in the name of Jesus whom Paul is preaching.
044	ACT	019	014	And there were certain seven sons of one Sceva, a Jewish high priest, doing this.
044	ACT	019	015	But the evil spirit responding said to them, I know Jesus, and am acquainted with Paul; but who are you?
044	ACT	019	016	And the man in whom was the evil spirit, leaping on them, domineering over both of them, prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.
044	ACT	019	017	And this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified;
044	ACT	019	018	and many of those having believed came, confessing, and renouncing their practices.
044	ACT	019	019	And many of those practicing curious arts, having brought their books, burnt them before all: and they estimated the price of them, and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver.
044	ACT	019	020	Thus the word of the Lord increased and accumulated strength according to His power.
044	ACT	019	021	And when these things were fulfilled, Paul purposed in spirit, having traveled through Macedonia and Achaia, to go on into Jerusalem, saying that, After I am there it behooves me also to see Rome.
044	ACT	019	022	And having sent two of those ministering to him, Timothy and Erastus, into Macedonia, himself spent the time in Asia.
044	ACT	019	023	And at that time there was no small commotion concerning the way.
044	ACT	019	024	For a certain Demetrius by name, a silversmith, making silver shrines of Diana, was bringing no small gain to the mechanics,
044	ACT	019	025	whom having assembled and the laborers about such things, he said, Men, you know that it is from this work that prosperity is to us:
044	ACT	019	026	and you see and hear, that not only at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, that this Paul having persuaded them has turned away a great multitude, saying that there are no gods made with hands.
044	ACT	019	027	And not only is this interest in danger to us to come into disrepute; but even the temple of the great goddess Diana to be considered for nought, and they are about even to despise the majesty of her, whom all Asia and the world worships.
044	ACT	019	028	And hearing and being filled with rage, they continued to cry out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.
044	ACT	019	029	And the city was filled with commotion: and they rushed of one accord into the theatre, seizing Gaius and Aristarchus, the Macedonians, the companions of Paul.
044	ACT	019	030	And Paul wishing to go in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not;
044	ACT	019	031	and certain ones of the Asiatic rulers, also being friends to him, having sent to him, continued to entreat him not to give himself up into the theatre.
044	ACT	019	032	Then indeed they continued to cry out some one thing, and some another: for the church was confused; and the most of them did not know on account of what they had come together.
044	ACT	019	033	And some from the crowd forced in Alexander, the Jews precipitating him forward; and Alexander, beckoning with his hand, wished to apologize to the people.
044	ACT	019	034	But recognizing that he is a Jew, there was one voice from all crying out about two hours, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.
044	ACT	019	035	And the city clerk having dismissed the multitudes, said, Ephesian men, for what one of men is there that does not know that the city of the Ephesians is a worshiper of the great goddess Diana, and of the statue having fallen down from Jupiter?
044	ACT	019	036	Therefore these things being unquestionable, it is necessary that you become calm, and do nothing rashly.
044	ACT	019	037	For you have led in these men, who are neither robbers of temples, nor are they blaspheming your goddess.
044	ACT	019	038	If indeed therefore Demetrius, and the mechanics along with him, have a charge against any one, the courts are in session, and there are lawyers: let them implead one another.
044	ACT	019	039	But if you are seeking something concerning other things, it shall be settled in the lawful church.
044	ACT	019	040	For indeed we are in danger of prosecution for the disturbance this day, there being no cause concerning which we shall be able to give a reason for this uproar.
044	ACT	019	041	And having said these things, he dismissed the church.
044	ACT	020	001	After the uproar ceased, Paul, having sent for the disciples and exhorted them, bidding them adieu, departed to go into Macedonia.
044	ACT	020	002	And having come through those regions, and exhorted them with much speaking, he came into Greece;
044	ACT	020	003	and having remained three months, a plot rising against him from the Jews, when about to sail for Syria, he was of a mind to return through Macedonia.
044	ACT	020	004	And Sopater the (son) of Pyrrhus, the Berean, and Aristarchus, the Thessalonian, and Secundus; and Gaius the Derbean, and Timothy; and Tychicus and Trophimus the Asiatics, accompanied him;
044	ACT	020	005	and these having gone in advance, awaited us in Troas;
044	ACT	020	006	and we, after the days of unleaven bread, sailed from Philippi, and came to them into Troas within five days; where we spent seven days.
044	ACT	020	007	And on the first of the Sabbaths we being assembled to break bread, Paul spoke to them, being about to depart the following day, and continued his discourse till midnight:
044	ACT	020	008	and there were many lamps in the upper room, where we were assembled.
044	ACT	020	009	Paul speaking more prolixly, there was a certain young man, Eutychus by name, sitting in the window, being borne down with deep sleep, completely relaxed by sleep, fell down from the third story, and was taken up dead.
044	ACT	020	010	And Paul, having come down, fell on him, and taking him in his arms said, Fear not; for his soul is in him:
044	ACT	020	011	and having come up, and broken the bread, and eaten, and talking a long time, until daydawn, thus he departed.
044	ACT	020	012	And they led up the boy alive, and were comforted exceedingly.
044	ACT	020	013	But we, having come in advance to the ship, embarked for Assos, thence being about to take up Paul, for he had so commanded us, himself being about to go on foot.
044	ACT	020	014	And when he met us at Assos, taking him up, we came to Mitylene.
044	ACT	020	015	And thence having sailed away on the following day we arrived opposite Chios; and on the following day we touched at Samos, and on the next day we came into Miletus.
044	ACT	020	016	For Paul decided to sail by Ephesus, in order that it might not be necessary for him to spend the time in Asia: for he was hastening, if it might be possible for him to be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.
044	ACT	020	017	And having sent from Miletus into Ephesus, he called for the elders of the church.
044	ACT	020	018	And when they came to him, he said to them, You know, that from the first day from which I came unto Asia, how I was with you all the time,
044	ACT	020	019	serving the Lord with all humility, and tears, and temptations, which came upon me through the plots of the Jews:
044	ACT	020	020	how I omitted nothing of those things which are profitable, that I should not declare unto you and teach you publicly and from house to house,
044	ACT	020	021	witnessing both to Jews, and to Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.
044	ACT	020	022	And now, behold, I go to Jerusalem bound in spirit, not knowing the things which shall come upon me in it:
044	ACT	020	023	except that the Holy Ghost in every city witnesses to me, saying that bonds and tribulations await me.
044	ACT	020	024	But I consider my life worthy of no consideration to myself, so as to finish my course, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to bear testimony to the gospel of the grace of God.
044	ACT	020	025	And now, behold, I know that you all, among whom I came preaching the gospel of the kingdom, shall see my face no more.
044	ACT	020	026	Therefore I witness to you this clay, that I am pure from the blood of all men;
044	ACT	020	027	for I did not shrink to declare unto you all the counsel of God.
044	ACT	020	028	Take heed to yourselves, and all the flock, over which the Holy Ghost has placed you shepherds, to shepherdise the church of God, which He bought with His own blood.
044	ACT	020	029	I know, that after my departure grievous wolves will rise up against you, not sparing the flock;
044	ACT	020	030	and men from you yourselves will rise up, speaking perverse things, in order to lead away disciples after them.
044	ACT	020	031	Watch therefore, remembering, that three years night and day I ceased not admonishing you with tears.
044	ACT	020	032	And now I commend you to God and the word of His grace, who is able to edify you, and give you an inheritance among all the sanctified.
044	ACT	020	033	I have not sought the silver, or gold, or raiment of any one;
044	ACT	020	034	you yourselves know, that these hands did minister to my necessities, and those along with me.
044	ACT	020	035	I have shown you all things, that it so behooveth you laboring to assist the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.
044	ACT	020	036	And having said these things, putting down his knees along with them all, he prayed.
044	ACT	020	037	And the weeping of all was great, and falling on the neck of Paul, they continued to kiss him copiously,
044	ACT	020	038	being especially grieved at the word which he had spoken, that they were about to see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship.
044	ACT	021	001	And when it came to pass, that we having been farewelled by them, embarked, sailing straight forward, we arrived at Cos, and on the following day to Rhodes, and thence to Patara.
044	ACT	021	002	And finding a ship sailing into Phoenicia, having embarked, we moved out.
044	ACT	021	003	And coming in sight of Cyprus, and leaving it on the left, we sailed to Syria, and disembarked at Tyre: for there the ship was delivering her cargo.
044	ACT	021	004	And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who continued to say to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go to Jerusalem.
044	ACT	021	005	And when it came to pass that we refitted during those days, having come out, we departed, all sending us forth, along with the women and children, out of the city: and putting down the knees on the shore, having prayed,
044	ACT	021	006	we farewelled one another, and went up into the ship; and they returned to their own homes.
044	ACT	021	007	And we continuing our voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais, and having saluted the brethren, we remained with them one day.
044	ACT	021	008	And on the following day, having come out, we came into Caesarea: and having entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, being one of the seven, we abode with him.
044	ACT	021	009	And there were to him four virgin daughters, prophesying.
044	ACT	021	010	And we remaining many days, a certain prophet, by name Agabus, came down from Judea;
044	ACT	021	011	and having come to us, and taking the girdle of Paul, binding his own feet and hands, said, These things says the Holy Ghost, The man whose girdle this is, will the Jews in Jerusalem bind and deliver into the hands of the Gentiles.
044	ACT	021	012	And when we heard these words, both we, and the citizens, exhorted him not to go up to Jerusalem.
044	ACT	021	013	Then Paul responded and said, What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? for I am ready not only to be bound, but to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.
044	ACT	021	014	And he not being persuaded, we acquiesced, saying, Let the will of the Lord be done.
044	ACT	021	015	And after those days, taking our luggage, we went up to Jerusalem:
044	ACT	021	016	and some of the disciples from Caesarea went along with us, bringing Mnason a certain Cyprian, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.
044	ACT	021	017	And we being in Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.
044	ACT	021	018	And on the following day, Paul goes with us to James; and all the elders assembled.
044	ACT	021	019	And having saluted them, he related each one of those things which God did among the Gentiles through his ministry.
044	ACT	021	020	And they hearing, continued to glorify God, and said to him, You see, brother, how many myriads there are of those who believe; and they are all zealots of the law:
044	ACT	021	021	and they have been informed concerning thee, that thou art teaching all the Jews who are among the Gentiles apostasy from Moses, saying that they are not to circumcise their children, nor to walk according to the customs.
044	ACT	021	022	Then what is it? it is altogether necessary that the multitude come together: for they will hear that you have come.
044	ACT	021	023	Therefore do this which we tell thee. There are four men among us having a vow upon them;
044	ACT	021	024	taking them, be purified along with them, and be at charges for them, that they may shave their head: and all shall know that there is nothing of those things they have been informed concerning thee; but that thyself art walking, keeping the law.
044	ACT	021	025	But concerning the Gentiles who have believed, we have sent to them, adjudicating that they keep themselves from idolatry, and blood, and strangulation, and fornication.
044	ACT	021	026	Then Paul, having taken the men, the next day being purified along with them, enters into the temple, proclaiming the fulfillment of the days of purification, until an offering may be made for each one of them.
044	ACT	021	027	And when the seven days were about to have an end, the Jews from Asia, seeing him in the temple, stirred up the whole multitude, and laid hands on him, crying out,
044	ACT	021	028	Israelitish men, help: this is the man, teaching all everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place, and he has even yet led Greeks into the temple, and polluted this holy place.
044	ACT	021	029	For they saw Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, whom they supposed that Paul led into the temple.
044	ACT	021	030	And the whole city was excited, and there was a commotion of the people: and taking Paul, they dragged him out of the temple; and immediately the doors were closed.
044	ACT	021	031	And seeking to kill him, the report went up to the chiliarch of the band, that all Jerusalem is in commotion;
044	ACT	021	032	who immediately, taking soldiers and centurions, ran to them: and they, seeing the chiliarch and the soldiers, ceased beating Paul.
044	ACT	021	033	Then the chiliarch, having come nigh, took Paul, and commanded that he should be bound with two chains; and was making inquiry who he might be, and what he had done.
044	ACT	021	034	And they continued to cry aloud in the multitude, some one thing, and some another: and he, being unable to know the certainty on account of the uproar, commanded that he should be led into the castle.
044	ACT	021	035	Then when he was on the threshold, it happened that he was carried by the soldiers, on account of the violence of the mob;
044	ACT	021	036	for the multitude of the people were following, crying out, Take him away.
044	ACT	021	037	And Paul, being about to be led into the castle, says to the chiliarch, Is it lawful for me to say something to thee? And he said, Do you speak Greek?
044	ACT	021	038	Are you not that Egyptian who before these days rising up and leading away into the desert four hundred men of daggers?
044	ACT	021	039	But Paul said, I am indeed a Jewish man, a Tarsean, a citizen of Cilicia, no mean city: but, I pray you, permit me to speak to the people.
044	ACT	021	040	And he permitting, Paul, standing on the threshold, beckoned with his hand to the people: and there being great silence, he spoke to them in the Hebrew tongue, saying:
044	ACT	022	001	Men, brethren, and fathers, hear now my apology unto you.
044	ACT	022	002	And hearing that he was speaking to them in the Hebrew tongue, they kept silent the more.
044	ACT	022	003	And he says, I am Jewish man, having been born in Tarsus of Cilicia, having been brought up in this city, educated at the feet of Gamaliel according to the accuracy of patristic law, being a zealot of God, as you all are this day;
044	ACT	022	004	who after this way persecuted unto death, binding and committing to prison both men and women;
044	ACT	022	005	as the high priest also, and all the eldership, witnessed me: from whom having also received letters from the brethren in Damascus, I was on my way, being about to lead them also hither into Jerusalem bound, that they might be punished.
044	ACT	022	006	And it came to pass, while I was journeying, and nigh unto Damascus, a great light, about midday, suddenly shone from heaven around me;
044	ACT	022	007	and I felt upon the ground, and heard a voice, saying to me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
044	ACT	022	008	And I responded, Who art thou, Lord? And He said to me, I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom thou art persecuting.
044	ACT	022	009	And those being along with me saw the light indeed, but heard not the voice of the one speaking to me.
044	ACT	022	010	And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Rising up, go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee concerning all things which have been ordained for thee to do.
044	ACT	022	011	And when I did not see on account of the glory of that light, and being led by the hand by those journeying with me, I came into Damascus.
044	ACT	022	012	And a certain Ananias, a man godly according to the law, and of good report by all the Jews dwelling there,
044	ACT	022	013	having come to me, and standing over me, said, Brother Saul, look up. And I at that hour looked up unto him.
044	ACT	022	014	And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee to know His will, and see the Just One, and hear the voice from His mouth;
044	ACT	022	015	because thou shalt be a witness for Him to all men of those things which thou hast seen and heard.
044	ACT	022	016	And now why tarriest thou? arising, be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on His name.
044	ACT	022	017	And it happened unto me, having returned into Jerusalem, and while I was praying in the temple, I was in an ecstasy;
044	ACT	022	018	and I saw Him speaking to me, Hasten, and depart quickly out of Jerusalem, because they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.
044	ACT	022	019	And I said, Lord, they know that I was imprisoning and binding those believing on thee throughout the synagogue;
044	ACT	022	020	and when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I was standing by, and consenting, and keeping the garments of those killing him.
044	ACT	022	021	And He said to me, Go: because I will send thee far away to the Gentiles.
044	ACT	022	022	And they continued to hear him until this word, and lifted up their voice, saying, Take away such a one from the earth: for it is not appropriate for him to live.
044	ACT	022	023	And they crying out, and rending their garments, and throwing dust into the air,
044	ACT	022	024	the chiliarch commanded that he should be led into the castle, saying that he should be tested by scourges, in order that he might know on account of what cause they continued so to cry out against him.
044	ACT	022	025	And when they were extending him to the scourges, Paul said to the centurion standing by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman, and uncondemned?
044	ACT	022	026	And the centurion hearing, having come to the chiliarch, announced to him, saying, What are you about to do? for this man is a Roman.
044	ACT	022	027	And the chiliarch, having come to him, said; Tell me, are you a Roman? And he said, Yes.
044	ACT	022	028	And the chiliarch responded, With a great sum obtained I this citizenship. And Paul said, But I was indeed born (a Roman citizen).
044	ACT	022	029	Then immediately those about to scourge him departed from him: and the chiliarch also feared, knowing that he was a Roman, and that he had bound him.
044	ACT	022	030	And on the following day, wishing to know the certainty as to what he is accused of by the Jews, he loosed him, and commanded the chief priests and all the sanhedrin to come together, and leading down Paul, he placed him in their midst.
044	ACT	023	001	And Paul, looking the sanhedrim in the face, said, Men, brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God unto this day.
044	ACT	023	002	And the high priest Ananias commanded those standing near him to smite him in the mouth.
044	ACT	023	003	Then Paul said to him, God is about to smite thee, thou whitewashed wall: indeed thou art sitting judging me according to the law, and dost thou command me to be smitten contrary to the law?
044	ACT	023	004	And those standing by said, Do you revile the high priest of God?
044	ACT	023	005	And Paul said, Brethren, I did not know that he is the high priest; for it is written, You shall not speak evil of the ruler of your people.
044	ACT	023	006	And Paul knowing that one part of them belongs to the Sadducees, and another to the Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men, brethren, I am a Pharisee, a son of the Pharisees: concerning the hope and the resurrection of the dead I am judged.
044	ACT	023	007	And he speaking this, there was a dissension of the Pharisees and Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.
044	ACT	023	008	For the Sadducees indeed say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.
044	ACT	023	009	And there was a great clamor: and certain ones of the scribes on the part of the Pharisees, rising up, continued to strive, saying, We find nothing evil in this man: but has a spirit or an angel spoken to him?
044	ACT	023	010	And the dissension being great, the chiliarch fearing lest Paul may be torn to pieces by them, commanded the army, having gone down, to take him from their midst, and lead him into the castle.
044	ACT	023	011	And on the following night, the Lord standing over him, said, Take courage: for as thou hast testified to the things concerning me in Jerusalem, so it behooveth thee also to testify to me in Rome.
044	ACT	023	012	And it being day, the Jews having formed a conspiracy, obligated themselves by an oath, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they might kill Paul.
044	ACT	023	013	And there were more than forty having made this plot:
044	ACT	023	014	who, having come to the chief priests and elders, said, We have anathematized ourselves with an anathema, to taste nothing until we may kill Paul.
044	ACT	023	015	Now therefore do you appeal to the chiliarch along with the sanhedrim, that he may lead him down to you, as about to investigate matters concerning him more thoroughly: and we are ready to kill him before he comes nigh.
044	ACT	023	016	And the son of Paul's sister, having heard of ambuscade, coming and entering into the castle, reported it to Paul.
044	ACT	023	017	And Paul, having called one of the centurions, said, Lead this young man to the chiliarch: for he has something to tell him.
044	ACT	023	018	Then indeed taking him, he led him to the chiliarch, and says, Paul the prisoner, having called me, requested me to lead this young man to you, having something to tell you.
044	ACT	023	019	And the chiliarch taking him by the hand, and having gone away privately, asked him, What is that which you have to tell me?
044	ACT	023	020	And he said, The Jews have entered into an agreement to ask you that to-morrow you may lead Paul to the sanhedrim, as about to make inquiry as to something more definite concerning him.
044	ACT	023	021	Therefore do not be persuaded by them: for more than forty of them lie in wait for him, who have obligated themselves by an oath, neither to eat nor drink until they may kill him: and now they are ready, awaiting the promise from you.
044	ACT	023	022	Then indeed the chiliarch sent away the young man, having commanded him to Tell no one that you have revealed these things to me.
044	ACT	023	023	And having called a certain two of the centurions, he said, Get ready two hundred soldiers that they may go unto Caesarea, and seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen, from the third hour of the night;
044	ACT	023	024	and prepare beasts of burden, that, having carried away Paul, you may deliver him safe to Felix the governor.
044	ACT	023	025	Writing a letter having this form:
044	ACT	023	026	Claudius Lysias to the most noble governor Felix, greeting.
044	ACT	023	027	This man, having been taken by the Jews, and being about to be put to death by them, having interposed with my army, I took out of their hands, having learned that he is a Roman:
044	ACT	023	028	and wishing to know the cause on account of which they clamored against him, I led him into their sanhedrim:
044	ACT	023	029	whom I found accused concerning questions of their law, having no charge worthy of death or bonds.
044	ACT	023	030	And a plot from them being revealed to me to be against the man, I sent him to thee, having commanded his accusers also to speak in thy presence.
044	ACT	023	031	Then indeed the soldiers, according to that which had been commanded them, taking Paul led him by night to Antipatris:
044	ACT	023	032	And on the following day letting the cavalry go on with him, they returned to the castle.
044	ACT	023	033	Who, having come into Caesarea, and delivered the letter to the governor, also committed Paul to him.
044	ACT	023	034	And having read, and made inquiry of what jurisdiction,
044	ACT	023	035	and ascertaining that he is from Cilicia, said, I will hear thee, when thy accusers may also be present, having commanded that he should be kept in Herod's judgment hall.
044	ACT	024	001	And after five days Ananias the high priest with certain elders, and a certain orator Tertyllus, came down, who appeared before the governor against Paul.
044	ACT	024	002	And he having been called, Tertyllus began to accuse him, saying,
044	ACT	024	003	Receiving great peace through thee, and prosperity accruing to this nation through thy wisdom, we receive with all gratitude, both always, and everywhere, O most noble Felix.
044	ACT	024	004	But in order that I may not weary you excessively, I exhort you to hear us patiently according to your clemency.
044	ACT	024	005	For having found this man pestilential, and stirring up seditions to all the Jews who are throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:
044	ACT	024	006	who also endeavored to pollute the temple: whom we indeed arrested,
044	ACT	024	008	with whom you yourself, having made inquiry, are able to know concerning all these things of which we accuse him.
044	ACT	024	009	And the Jews were consenting, saying, Truly these things are so.
044	ACT	024	010	And Paul responded, the governor beckoning to him to speak; Knowing you to be a judge to this nation from many years, I cheerfully apologize as to the things concerning myself:
044	ACT	024	011	you being able to know, that there are not more than twelve days to me since I came up to Jerusalem to worship.
044	ACT	024	012	Neither did they find me in the temple disputing with any one, or causing an excitement of the multitude, neither in the synagogues, nor throughout the city:
044	ACT	024	013	neither are they able to prove before you the things which they are now accusing me.
044	ACT	024	014	But I confess this to you, that according to the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of our fathers, believing all things which have been written in the law and in the prophets:
044	ACT	024	015	having hope towards God, which they themselves also receive, that there is going to be a resurrection, both of the just and unjust.
044	ACT	024	016	In this I also exercise, to always have a conscience void of offense toward God and men.
044	ACT	024	017	And after many years I came to do alms and offerings to my race;
044	ACT	024	018	in which they found me having been purified in the temple, not with rabble, nor with an uproar; and were certain Jews from Asia,
044	ACT	024	019	whom it behooves to be present before me, and accuse me, if they should have anything against me.
044	ACT	024	020	Or let them tell what injustice they found, while I was standing before the sanhedrim,
044	ACT	024	021	except concerning this one voice, which I cried out standing in their midst, that concerning the resurrection of the dead I am judged before you this day.
044	ACT	024	022	And Felix having learned more thoroughly the things concerning the way, deferred them, saying, When Lysias the chiliarch may come down, I will diagnose the things appertaining to you:
044	ACT	024	023	having commanded the centurion to keep him, and let him have liberty, and prohibit no one of his friends from ministering unto him.
044	ACT	024	024	And after certain day, Felix with Drusilla his wife, being a Jewess, coming, sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith which is towards Christ Jesus.
044	ACT	024	025	And he reasoning concerning righteousness and temperance and the coming judgment, Felix, being alarmed, responded, Go thy way for this time; and having received an opportunity, I will call for thee:
044	ACT	024	026	at the same time also hoping that money will be given to him by Paul; therefore indeed the more frequently sending for him, he conversed with him.
044	ACT	024	027	But two years having passed away Felix received Porcius Festus as his successor: and Felix, wishing to confer on the Jews a favor, left Paul bound.
044	ACT	025	001	Then Festus having entered upon his office, after three days went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem;
044	ACT	025	002	and both the chief priests and the first men of the Jews appeared before him against Paul, and continued to entreat him,
044	ACT	025	003	asking favor against him, in order that he might send him to Jerusalem, making a plot to kill him on the road.
044	ACT	025	004	Then indeed Festus responded, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and himself was about to go away quickly:
044	ACT	025	005	Then, says he, Let the influential ones among you, coming down, accuse him, if there is anything wrong in the man.
044	ACT	025	006	And having tarried with them not more than eight or ten days, having come down to Caesarea, on the following day, sitting on the tribunal, he commanded that Paul should be brought forth.
044	ACT	025	007	And he being present, the Jews having come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing against him charges many and heavy, which they were not able to prove.
044	ACT	025	008	And Paul apologizing, that Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar, have I done anything wrong.
044	ACT	025	009	And Festus, wishing to confer a gratification on the Jews, responding to Paul, said, Are you willing, having gone up to Jerusalem, there to be judged by me concerning these things?
044	ACT	025	010	And Paul said, I am standing at the tribunal of Caesar, where it behooves me to be judged. To the Jews I have done nothing wrong, as you indeed well know.
044	ACT	025	011	If therefore I indeed am guilty of unrighteousness, and have done anything worthy of death, I do not ask not to die: but if nothing of these things of which they accuse me is true, no man is able to gratify them (by my death): I appeal unto Caesar.
044	ACT	025	012	Then Festus, having spoken with the council, responded, Thou hast appealed unto Caesar; thou shalt go unto Caesar.
044	ACT	025	013	And some days having passed away, king Agrippa and Bernice came down to Caesarea, saluting Festus.
044	ACT	025	014	And while they were spending many days there, Festus expounded to the king the matters appertaining to Paul, saying, A certain man has been left a prisoner by Felix:
044	ACT	025	015	concerning whom, I being in Jerusalem, the chief priests and elders of the Jews appeared before me, asking condemnation against him;
044	ACT	025	016	to whom I responded, that it is not the customs to the Romans to slay any man gratuitously, before that the accused may have his accusers face to face, and receive a place of defence concerning the charge.
044	ACT	025	017	Then they, having come together to this place, making no delay, immediately sitting on the judgment-seat, I commanded that the man should be led forth;
044	ACT	025	018	concerning whom his accusers standing by, brought no evil charge of those things which I supposed:
044	ACT	025	019	but they had certain questions against him concerning their own religion, and about a certain Jesus, who is dead, whom Paul was saying that He is alive.
044	ACT	025	020	And I, being at a loss as to the question concerning these things, asked him if he is willing to go to Jerusalem, and there to be judged concerning these things.
044	ACT	025	021	And Paul having demanded that he should be kept for the diagnosis of Augustus, I demanded that he should be kept until I shall send him to Caesar.
044	ACT	025	022	And Agrippa said to Festus, I myself also would wish to hear the man. He says, To-morrow you shall hear him.
044	ACT	025	023	Then on the following day, Agrippa and Bernice having come with great pomp, and entering into the auditorium, along with the chiliarchs, and chief men of the city, and, Festus commanding, Paul was led forth.
044	ACT	025	024	And Festus says, O king Agrippa, and all ye men present with us, you see this man, concerning whom the whole multitude of the Jews is besieging me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying out that it does not behoove him to live any longer.
044	ACT	025	025	But I discovered that he had done nothing worthy of death, however he himself appealing to Caesar, I decided to send him.
044	ACT	025	026	Concerning whom I have nothing definite to write to my lord; therefore I have led him to you, and especially to thee, O king Agrippa, in order that, there being an investigation, I may have something which I shall write;
044	ACT	025	027	for it seems to me to be unreasonable, sending a prisoner, and not to signify charges against him.
044	ACT	026	001	And Agrippa said to Paul, It is permitted to thee to speak for thyself. Then Paul reaching forth his hand, proceeded with his defence:
044	ACT	026	002	O king Agrippa, I consider myself happy, being about this day to make my defence before thee concerning all those things of which I am accused by the Jews:
044	ACT	026	003	especially as thou art acquainted with all the customs and questions among the Jews: therefore I pray you to hear me patiently.
044	ACT	026	004	Moreover indeed all the Jews know my life from my youth; being from the beginning in my nation and in Jerusalem,
044	ACT	026	005	knowing me originally, if they may be willing to testify, that according to the most rigid sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.
044	ACT	026	006	And now for the hope of the promise which is from God to our fathers, I stand being judged:
044	ACT	026	007	unto which our twelve tribes constantly worshiping night and day, hope to attain: concerning which hope I am accused by the Jews, O king.
044	ACT	026	008	Why is it judged by you incredible, if God shall raise the dead?
044	ACT	026	009	Moreover indeed, I thought to myself that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus the Nazarene:
044	ACT	026	010	which I did also in Jerusalem, and shut up many of the saints in prison; and having received authority from the chief priests, and they being slain, I gave my vote against them;
044	ACT	026	011	and throughout all the synagogues, frequently punishing them, I compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceeding mad against them, I was persecuting them even also unto foreign cities.
044	ACT	026	012	Meanwhile journeying to Damascus with power and authority of the chief priests, I saw on the way, O king,
044	ACT	026	013	about midday, a light from heaven above the brightness of the sun, shining around me and those traveling with me;
044	ACT	026	014	and we all having fallen to the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against goads.
044	ACT	026	015	And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou art persecuting.
044	ACT	026	016	But rise up, and stand upon thy feet: for unto this have I appeared unto thee, to make thee a minister and a martyr both of those things which thou hast seen, and of which I will appear unto thee;
044	ACT	026	017	delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,
044	ACT	026	018	to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness unto light, and from the power of Satan unto God, in order that they may receive remission of sins, and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in me.
044	ACT	026	019	Therefore, O king, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision:
044	ACT	026	020	but first to those in Damascus, and also in Jerusalem, and throughout all the country of Judea, and to the Gentiles, I was preaching that they should repent and turn to God, doing things worthy of repentance.
044	ACT	026	021	On account of these things the Jews, taking me while in the temple, endeavored to kill me.
044	ACT	026	022	Then having received help from God, I have stood unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said were about to come to pass:
044	ACT	026	023	how that Christ must suffer, how being the first from the resurrection of the dead, he is to proclaim light both to the people, and the Gentiles.
044	ACT	026	024	And he making his defence to these things, Festus says with a loud voice, O Paul, thou art beside thyself; many writings turned thee into insanity.
044	ACT	026	025	But Paul says, I am not a maniac, most noble Festus; but I speak forth the words of truth and soberness.
044	ACT	026	026	For the king, to whom I also speak boldly, knows concerning these things: for I am persuaded that nothing of these things is hidden; for this has not been done in a corner.
044	ACT	026	027	O king Agrippa, dost thou believe the prophets? I know that thou believest them.
044	ACT	026	028	And Agrippa said to Paul, With little persuasion thou dost persuade thyself to make me a Christian.
044	ACT	026	029	And Paul said, I would to God, that both in little and in much, not only you, but also all of those hearing me this day, were such as I am, except these bonds.
044	ACT	026	030	And the king, and the governor, and Bernice, and those sitting with them, arose up:
044	ACT	026	031	and having gone away, they were talking to one another, saying, that This man is doing nothing worthy of death or of bonds.
044	ACT	026	032	But Agrippa said to Festus, This man was able to have been released, if he had not appealed to Caesar.
044	ACT	027	001	And when it was determined that we should sail away into Italy, they committed both Paul and certain other prisoners to the centurion, Julius by name, of the band of Augustus.
044	ACT	027	002	And having embarked on an Adramyttium ship, about to sail to those places along Asia, we set sail; Aristarchus, the Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.
044	ACT	027	003	And on the following day we disembarked at Sidon; and Julius, treating Paul kindly, permitted him having gone to his friends to receive their benefactions.
044	ACT	027	004	And having embarked from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary:
044	ACT	027	005	and having sailed through the sea which is opposite Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came down into Myra of Lycia.
044	ACT	027	006	And there the centurion having found an Alexandrian ship sailing into Italy; transferred us into it.
044	ACT	027	007	And sailing slowly during many days, and were come with difficulty over against Cnidus, the wind not favoring us, we sailed under Crete, opposite Salmone;
044	ACT	027	008	and, with difficulty passing by it, we came into a certain place called Fair Havens, near to which was the city Lasea.
044	ACT	027	009	And much time passing away, and navigation being already unsafe, because the Fast had already passed by, Paul exhorted them,
044	ACT	027	010	saying to them, Men, I perceive that this voyage is going to be with peril and much loss, not only with the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.
044	ACT	027	011	But the centurion trusted the pilot and midshipman, rather than the things spoken by Paul.
044	ACT	027	012	And the harbor being unsafe for spending the winter, most of them projected to the council to depart thence, if perchance they might be able, having arrived into Phoenix, to spend the winter there; a harbor of Crete, looking toward the southeast and the northeast.
044	ACT	027	013	And the south wind blowing, thinking they could achieve their purpose, lifting up a sail, they went coasting along near Crete.
044	ACT	027	014	Not long afterward a typhonic wind, called Euraquilo, set in against her;
044	ACT	027	015	and the ship having been seized, and being unable to resist the wind, having given away to it, we were borne along.
044	ACT	027	016	And running under a certain island called Clauda, we were scarcely able to get possession of the boat:
044	ACT	027	017	which lifting up they used helps, under-girding the ship; and fearing lest they might fall into Syrtis, lowering the gear, they were thus carried along.
044	ACT	027	018	And we being tossed violently by the storm, they were successively making the casting out,
044	ACT	027	019	and on the third day with their own hands they threw overboard the tackling of the ship;
044	ACT	027	020	and neither sun nor stars appearing for many days, and there being no small tempest on us, finally all hope of saving us was taken away.
044	ACT	027	021	And there being much fasting, Paul standing in their midst, said, O men, truly it behooved you obeying me, not to depart from Crete, and incur this injury and loss.
044	ACT	027	022	And now I exhort you to take courage: for there will be no loss of the life of you, except the ship.
044	ACT	027	023	For the angel of God, whose I am, and whom indeed I serve, stood by me this night,
044	ACT	027	024	saying, Fear not, Paul; for it behooveth thee to stand before Caesar: and, behold, God has given thee all those sailing along with thee.
044	ACT	027	025	Therefore cheer up, O men: for I believe God, that it shall be according to the manner which He has spoken to me.
044	ACT	027	026	But it behooves us to fall upon a certain island.
044	ACT	027	027	And when it was the fourteenth night, we being borne along in the Adriatic Sea, about the middle of the night the sailors surmised that some country was coming to them.
044	ACT	027	028	And having sounded, they found it twenty fathoms; and moving on a short distance, and sounding again, they found it fifteen fathoms;
044	ACT	027	029	and fearing lest they may fall out against rough places, casting four anchors from the stern, they were praying that the day should come.
044	ACT	027	030	And the sailors seeking to escape from the ship, and lowering the boat into the sea, with a pretext as about to cast anchors from the prow,
044	ACT	027	031	Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, Unless these may remain in the ship, you are not able to be saved.
044	ACT	027	032	Then the soldiers cut the ropes away from the boat, and let it fall out.
044	ACT	027	033	But until the day was about to come, Paul exhorted all to take food, saying, Already this day you remain in a state of solicitude, the fourteenth day, receiving nothing.
044	ACT	027	034	Therefore I exhort you to take food: for this is for your safety: for not a hair of your head shall perish.
044	ACT	027	035	And having spoken these words, and taken bread, he gave thanks to God in the presence of all, and breaking it, began to eat.
044	ACT	027	036	And all becoming cheerful, themselves also took food.
044	ACT	027	037	And we were two hundred and seventy-six souls in the ship.
044	ACT	027	038	And having been revived by the food, they lightened the ship, casting the wheat over into the sea.
044	ACT	027	039	And when it was day, they did not recognize the land: but discovered a certain gulf having a shore, into which they determined, if possible, to thrust out the ship.
044	ACT	027	040	And having knocked off the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time loosing the bands of the rudders, and raising up the main sail to the blowing wind, they made for the shore.
044	ACT	027	041	And having fallen into a place where two seas met, they broke the ship, and indeed the prow, sticking fast, remained motionless, but the stern was torn off by the violence (of the wind).
044	ACT	027	042	And the counsel of the soldiers was that they should kill the prisoners, lest some one, having outswum them, might escape:
044	ACT	027	043	but the centurion, wishing to save Paul, forbade them from their counsel; and commanded that those who were able to swim, having first thrown themselves overboard, to go to the land;
044	ACT	027	044	and the rest, some on planks, and others on some parts from the ship. And thus it came to pass that all came safe to the land.
044	ACT	028	001	And having been saved, we recognized that the island is called Melita.
044	ACT	028	002	And the barbarians extended no small philanthropy to us: for, having kindled a fire, they received us all to it, on account of the recent rain and cold.
044	ACT	028	003	And Paul having gathered up a certain bundle of sticks, and placed it on the fire, a viper, having come out from the heat, fastened on his hand.
044	ACT	028	004	But when the barbarians saw the beast hanging from his hand, they said to one another, Surely this man is a murderer, whom, having been saved from the sea, justice did not permit to live.
044	ACT	028	005	Then indeed, having shaken off the beast into the fire, he suffered no injury:
044	ACT	028	006	and they were looking for him to be about to swell up and suddenly fall down dead. But having looked a long time, and seeing nothing out of place come to him, changing their minds, they said that he was a god.
044	ACT	028	007	But in the regions around about that place there were farms belonging to the chief man of the island, by name Publius: who, having received us, entertained us courteously three days.
044	ACT	028	008	And it came to pass, that the father of Publius was lying prostrate with fevers and dysentery: to whom Paul having come in, and prayed, laying hands on him, healed him.
044	ACT	028	009	And this taking place, the rest also, on the island having diseases, continued to come to him, and be healed;
044	ACT	028	010	who also honored us with many honors; and conferred on us, departing, those things appertaining to use.
044	ACT	028	011	And after three months we embarked in an Alexandrian ship, having spent the winter in the island, dedicated to the sons of Jupiter.
044	ACT	028	012	And having disembarked into Syracuse, we remained three days;
044	ACT	028	013	thence having come circuitously, we arrived into Rhegium. And after one day there being a south wind, we came the second day to Puteoli,
044	ACT	028	014	where having found brethren, we were entreated to remain with them seven days: and thus we came into Rome.
044	ACT	028	015	And the brethren, hearing the news concerning us, came thence to meet us at the Appian Forum and Three Taverns: whom Paul, seeing, having given thanks to God, took courage.
044	ACT	028	016	And when we came into Rome, it was permitted to Paul to remain to himself with the soldier guarding him.
044	ACT	028	017	And it came to pass, after three days, he called together those who were first of the Jews; and they having assembled, he said to them, I, men, brethren, having done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, was committed a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans;
044	ACT	028	018	who judging me, were counseling to release me, because there was nothing worthy of death in me:
044	ACT	028	019	and the Jews speaking against it, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, not having anything for which to accuse my nation.
044	ACT	028	020	Then for this cause I have called you, to see you, and talk to you: for on account of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.
044	ACT	028	021	And they said to him, Neither have we received letters from Judea concerning you, neither has any one of the brethren coming, proclaimed or spoken anything evil concerning you.
044	ACT	028	022	But we desire to hear from you what you think: for indeed concerning this sect, it is known to us that it is everywhere spoken against.
044	ACT	028	023	And having appointed a day with him, many came to him into his hired house, to whom witnessing he expounded the kingdom of God, indeed persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses, and the prophets, from morning unto evening.
044	ACT	028	024	And some of them indeed believed the things spoken, but others continued to doubt;
044	ACT	028	025	and they being disharmonious to one another, dispersed, Paul saying one word, that truly the Holy Ghost spoke through the prophet Isaiah to your fathers, saying,
044	ACT	028	026	Go to this people, and say, By hearing ye shall hear, and may not understand; and seeing you shall see, and may not perceive:
044	ACT	028	027	for the heart of this people is waxed gross, and they heard with their ears heavily, and closed their eyes; lest they may see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn, and I shall heal them.
044	ACT	028	028	Therefore let it be known unto you, that this salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear.
044	ACT	028	030	And he spent a whole biennium in his own hired house, and received all those coming to him,
044	ACT	028	031	preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things concerning the Lord Jesus, with all boldness, uninterruptedly.

045	ROM	001	001	Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called an apostle, having been separated unto the gospel of God,
045	ROM	001	002	which He proclaimed beforehand through His prophets in the holy scriptures,
045	ROM	001	003	concerning his Son, having been born of the seed of David according to the flesh;
045	ROM	001	004	having been ordained the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, from the resurrection of the dead, of Jesus Christ our Lord:
045	ROM	001	005	through whom we received grace and apostleship, unto obedience of faith among all the Gentiles, in behalf of his name:
045	ROM	001	006	among whom ye are also called of Jesus Christ:
045	ROM	001	007	to all the beloved of God who are in Rome, saints having been called. Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
045	ROM	001	008	In the first place, indeed, I praise my God through Jesus Christ for you all, because your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.
045	ROM	001	009	For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of his Son, how I unceasingly make mention of you always in my prayer;
045	ROM	001	010	praying, if by any means I shall be prospered in the will of God to come to you.
045	ROM	001	011	For I long to see you, in order that I may impart unto you a certain spiritual grace, that you may be established;
045	ROM	001	012	but this is the consolation among you through faith in one another, both of you and me.
045	ROM	001	013	But I do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, that frequently I purposed to come to you, and was hindered hitherto, in order that I may have some fruit among you, as well as also among other Gentiles.
045	ROM	001	014	I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the barbarians; both to the wise, and the unwise:
045	ROM	001	015	so to my utmost ability, I am ready to preach the gospel to you who are in Rome also.
045	ROM	001	016	For I am not ashamed of the gospel: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.
045	ROM	001	017	For the righteousness of God is revealed in him from faith to faith: as has been written, But the just shall live by faith.
045	ROM	001	018	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;
045	ROM	001	019	because that which is known of God is manifest in them; for God has revealed it to them:
045	ROM	001	020	for the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are seen, being known by the things which are made, even His eternal power and divinity; so that they are without excuse:
045	ROM	001	021	because, knowing God, they did not glorify Him as God, neither were they thankful; but they became vain in their reasonings, and their foolish heart was darkened.
045	ROM	001	022	Saying that they were wise, they became fools,
045	ROM	001	023	and changed the glory of the invisible God into the similitude of the likeness of corruptible man, and of birds, and of quadrupeds, and of creeping things.
045	ROM	001	024	Therefore God gave them up, in the lusts of their hearts, to impurity, to dishonor their bodies among themselves:
045	ROM	001	025	who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed for evermore: amen.
045	ROM	001	026	On account of this God gave them up to the lusts of dishonor: for indeed their women changed the natural use to that which is against nature:
045	ROM	001	027	likewise also the men, having left the natural use of the woman, burned in their desire towards one another; men with men working out disgrace, and receiving the reward of their error among themselves which it behooved.
045	ROM	001	028	And as they did not approve to have God in their knowledge, God gave them up to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are inappropriate;
045	ROM	001	029	being filled with all injustice, wickedness, vice, covetousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceitfulness, evil affection;
045	ROM	001	030	whisperers, calumniators, haters of God, insulters, proud, arrogant, practitioners of evils, disobedient to parents,
045	ROM	001	031	covenant-breakers, incontinent, without natural affections, unmerciful,
045	ROM	001	032	who, knowing the rightfulness of God, that those who do such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but they even delight in those who are doing them.
045	ROM	002	001	Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, every one judging. For in whatsoever thou art judging another, thou art condemning thyself; for thou judging art doing the same things.
045	ROM	002	002	For we know that the judgment of God according to truth is against those doing such things.
045	ROM	002	003	But do you consider this, O man, judging those doing such things, and doing the same, that you shall escape the judgment of God?
045	ROM	002	004	Do you look with contempt upon the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God is leading you to repentance?
045	ROM	002	005	But according to thy hardness and thy impenitent heart, thou art treasuring up to thyself wrath against the day of wrath and of the revelation of the righteous judgment of God;
045	ROM	002	006	who will give to each one according to his works:
045	ROM	002	007	to those indeed who with patience of good work are seeking glory and honor and immortality, eternal life:
045	ROM	002	008	but to those who are of self-seeking, and disobedient to the truth, but obedient to unrighteousness, there are indignation and wrath.
045	ROM	002	009	Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that is working out evil, both the Jew first, and the Greek;
045	ROM	002	010	but glory and honor and peace to every one doing good; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.
045	ROM	002	011	For there is no respect of persons with God.
045	ROM	002	012	For so many as sinned without law will also perish without law; and so many as sinned under the law shall be judged by the law;
045	ROM	002	013	for the hearers of the law are not righteous with God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.
045	ROM	002	014	For when the Gentiles, not having the law, may by nature do the things of the law, they, not having the law, are a law unto themselves:
045	ROM	002	015	who show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience witnessing, and their thoughts accusing or indeed excusing with one another,
045	ROM	002	016	in the day when God will judge the secrets of men through my gospel according to Jesus Christ.
045	ROM	002	017	But if you are denominated a Jew, and rest in the law, and boast in God,
045	ROM	002	018	and know his will, and approve the things which are excellent, being taught by the law;
045	ROM	002	019	and persuade yourself that you are a guide of the blind, a light of those who are in darkness, an instructor of the ignorant,
045	ROM	002	020	a teacher of the juveniles, having a form of knowledge and truth in the law;
045	ROM	002	021	therefore do not you who teach another teach yourself? do you, who preach not to steal, steal?
045	ROM	002	022	do you, who say not to commit adultery, commit adultery? do you, who abominate idolatry, rob temples?
045	ROM	002	023	do you, who boast in the law, through the transgression of the law dishonor God?
045	ROM	002	024	For the name of God is blasphemed by you among the Gentiles, as has been written.
045	ROM	002	025	For circumcision indeed profits, if you do the law: but if you be a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.
045	ROM	002	026	Then if uncircumcision may keep the righteousness of the law, will not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?
045	ROM	002	027	and that which is uncircumcision by nature, perfecting the law, will judge you, who through the letter and circumcision are a transgressor of the law.
045	ROM	002	028	For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly; neither is circumcision that which is outwardly in the flesh.
045	ROM	002	029	But he is a Jew, who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.
045	ROM	003	001	Then what more belongs to the Jew, or what is the profit of circumcision?
045	ROM	003	002	Much every way. For indeed, in the first place, the oracles of God were committed unto them.
045	ROM	003	003	For what if some did not believe? whether will their unbelief destroy the faith of God?
045	ROM	003	004	it could not be so: but let God be true, and every man a liar; as indeed it has been written, In order that you may be justified in your words, and shall prevail, in your judgment.
045	ROM	003	005	But if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unjust administering wrath? I speak according to a man.
045	ROM	003	006	It could not be so: then how will God judge the world?
045	ROM	003	007	And if the truth of God through my falsehood abounded unto His glory, why am I still judged as a sinner?
045	ROM	003	008	are we not indeed thus traduced, and as some say we speak, that, Let us do evil in order that good may come? whose condemnation is just.
045	ROM	003	009	Then what? are we the better? By no means: for we have proven already that both Jews and Greeks are all under sin;
045	ROM	003	010	as has been written, There is no one good, not one:
045	ROM	003	011	there is no one who understands, there is no one who seeks out God;
045	ROM	003	012	all have gone away, they have all together become unprofitable; there is no one who is doing good, there is not one.
045	ROM	003	013	Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips.
045	ROM	003	014	Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.
045	ROM	003	015	Whose feet are swift to shed blood:
045	ROM	003	016	destruction and misery are in their ways:
045	ROM	003	017	and they have not known the way of peace.
045	ROM	003	018	The fear of God is not before their eyes.
045	ROM	003	019	But we know that so many things as the law speaks, it says to those under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may become guilty before God.
045	ROM	003	020	Therefore no flesh shall be justified by works of law: for through law there is a perfect knowledge of sin.
045	ROM	003	021	And now the righteousness of God without law has been made manifest, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;
045	ROM	003	022	but the righteousness of God through faith of Jesus Christ is unto all who believe: for there is no difference,
045	ROM	003	023	for all sinned, and come short of the glory of God;
045	ROM	003	024	being freely justified by his grace, through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus:
045	ROM	003	025	whom God sent forth an expiation through faith in his blood, unto the manifestation of His righteousness through the remission of the sins which are passed,
045	ROM	003	026	in the forbearance of God; unto the manifestation of his righteousness at the present time, so that he is just, and justifying him who is of the faith of Jesus.
045	ROM	003	027	Then where is boasting? It is excluded. By what law? of works? No; but by the law of faith.
045	ROM	003	028	For we conclude that a man is justified by faith without works of law.
045	ROM	003	029	Whether is he the God of the Jews only? is He not also the God of the Gentiles? Yea, also of the Gentiles:
045	ROM	003	030	truly there is one God, who will justify the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith.
045	ROM	003	031	Then do we make void the law through faith? It could not be so: but we establish the law.
045	ROM	004	001	Then what shall we say that Abraham, our father according to the flesh, has found?
045	ROM	004	002	For if Abraham were justified by works, he has glorification; but not before God.
045	ROM	004	003	For what does the scripture say? Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness.
045	ROM	004	004	But to him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned according to grace, but according to debt;
045	ROM	004	005	but to him that worketh not, but believeth on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is reckoned for righteousness.
045	ROM	004	006	Indeed David also speaks of the blessedness of the man, to whom God imputes righteousness without works,
045	ROM	004	007	Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered;
045	ROM	004	008	blessed is the man of whom the Lord may not impute sin.
045	ROM	004	009	Then does this blessedness come on the circumcision, or on the uncircumcision? for we say That faith was imputed to Abraham for righteousness.
045	ROM	004	010	Then how was it imputed? to him, being in circumcision or uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
045	ROM	004	011	And he received the sign of circumcision, and the seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had in uncircumcision: that he should be the father of all who believed, through uncircumcision; and righteousness should be imputed to them;
045	ROM	004	012	and the father of circumcision to them who not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had in uncircumcision.
045	ROM	004	013	For the promise to Abraham or his seed, that he should be the heir of the world, was not through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.
045	ROM	004	014	For if the heirs were by the law, faith has been made void, and the promise vitiated.
045	ROM	004	015	For the law works out wrath: for where there is no law, there is no transgression.
045	ROM	004	016	Therefore it is by faith, in order that it may be by grace; that the promise may be sure to all the seed; not only of the law, but also of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,
045	ROM	004	017	as it has been written, That I have constituted thee the father of many nations, before God whom he believed, who quickens the dead, and calls things which are not as really existing:
045	ROM	004	018	who against hope confided in hope, that he should be the father of many nations, according to that which had been spoken, So shall thy seed be:
045	ROM	004	019	and being not weak in faith, he considered not his body already dead, being about a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarah's womb:
045	ROM	004	020	but he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was filled up with dynamite through faith, having given glory to God;
045	ROM	004	021	and being fully assured, that whatsoever he has promised, he is able also to perform.
045	ROM	004	022	Therefore it was indeed imputed unto him for righteousness.
045	ROM	004	023	And it was not written on account of him alone, that it was imputed to him;
045	ROM	004	024	but on account of us also, to whom it is about to be imputed, who believe on him who raised up our Lord Jesus from the dead;
045	ROM	004	025	who was delivered on account of our transgressions, and raised for our justification.
045	ROM	005	001	Therefore having been justified by faith, let us have peace toward God through our Lord Jesus Christ:
045	ROM	005	002	through whom we also have access by faith unto this grace in which we stand, and let us rejoice in the hope of the glory of God.
045	ROM	005	003	And not only so, but let us also rejoice in tribulation; knowing that tribulation works out endurance;
045	ROM	005	004	and endurance, approval; and approval, hope:
045	ROM	005	005	and hope makes not ashamed; because the divine love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Ghost who has been given unto us.
045	ROM	005	006	For we being yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly:
045	ROM	005	007	for scarcely will one die for a righteous man; for perhaps some one even dares to die for a good man.
045	ROM	005	008	And God commends his love to us, because, we being yet sinners, Christ died for us.
045	ROM	005	009	How much more then, having now been justified by his blood, shall we be saved from wrath through him.
045	ROM	005	010	For if being enemies we are reconciled to God through the death of his Son; how much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved through his life:
045	ROM	005	011	but not only so, but even rejoicing in God through Jesus Christ our Lord, through whom we now received reconciliation.
045	ROM	005	012	Therefore, as by one man sin came into the world, and death by sin; and thus death came upon all men, in that all sinned;
045	ROM	005	013	(for until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed, there being no law;
045	ROM	005	014	but death reigned from Adam unto Moses, even on those who did not sin after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the type of him who is to come.
045	ROM	005	015	But not as was the transgression, even so is the free gift: for if by the transgression of one many died, how much more by the grace of one man, Jesus Christ, did the grace of God and the gift abound unto many!
045	ROM	005	016	And not as by the one having sinned, is the free gift; for indeed, judgment was from one unto condemnation, but the free gift is from many transgressions unto justification.
045	ROM	005	017	For if by the transgression of one death reigned through one; how much more shall those receiving the abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, Christ Jesus!)
045	ROM	005	018	Therefore then, as by the transgression of one, judgment came to all men to condemnation; so also through the righteousness of one, the free gift came on all men unto the justification of life:
045	ROM	005	019	for as by the disobedience of one man many were made sinners, so also by the obedience of one man shall many be made righteous.
045	ROM	005	020	But the law came, that the transgression might abound; but where sin did abound, there did grace superabound:
045	ROM	005	021	in order that as sin reigned through death, so may grace reign also through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
045	ROM	006	001	Then what shall we say? must we abide in sin, in order that grace may abound?
045	ROM	006	002	It could not be so. How shall we, who are dead unto sin, live any longer in it?
045	ROM	006	003	Whether do you not know, that so many of us as were baptized unto Jesus Christ were baptized into His death?
045	ROM	006	004	Therefore we were buried with him by baptism into death: in order that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so must we also walk in newness of life.
045	ROM	006	005	For if we have grown together in the likeness of His death, we shall also be in the likeness of his resurrection:
045	ROM	006	006	knowing this, that our old man is crucified along with him, in order that the body of sin may be destroyed, that we may no longer serve sin;
045	ROM	006	007	for the one having died has been made free from sin.
045	ROM	006	008	But if we died along with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him:
045	ROM	006	009	knowing that Christ having risen from the dead dies no more; death no longer has dominion over him.
045	ROM	006	010	For the death that he died, he died unto sin once: but the life that he lives, he lives unto God.
045	ROM	006	011	So you also thus reckon yourselves dead unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ.
045	ROM	006	012	Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that you should obey the lusts of it:
045	ROM	006	013	neither present your members arms of iniquity unto sin; but present yourselves to God, as alive from the dead, and your members arms of righteousness unto God.
045	ROM	006	014	For sin shall not have dominion over you: for you are not under the law, but under grace.
045	ROM	006	015	What then? can we commit sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? it could not be so.
045	ROM	006	016	Do you not know, that to whom you present yourselves servants unto obedience, ye are servants to whom you obey; whether of sin unto death, or obedience unto righteousness?
045	ROM	006	017	But thanks be unto God, that whereas ye were servants of sin, but you have obeyed from the heart the type of teaching into which ye were delivered:
045	ROM	006	018	but having been made free from sin, ye became servants unto righteousness.
045	ROM	006	019	I speak after the manner of a man on account of the weakness of your carnality. For as ye presented your members as servants unto impurity and lawlessness pursuant to lawlessness, so now present your members servants unto righteousness pursuant to sanctification.
045	ROM	006	020	For when you were the servants of sin, you were free from righteousness.
045	ROM	006	021	What fruit then had you at that time in those things in which you are now ashamed? for the end of these things is death.
045	ROM	006	022	But now having been made free from sin, and having become servants unto God, you have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end eternal life.
045	ROM	006	023	For the wages of sin is death; but the free gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord,
045	ROM	007	001	Whether are you ignorant, O brethren, for I speak to those knowing the law, for the law hath dominion over a man for so long time as he may live?
045	ROM	007	002	For a woman who is under her husband has been given to her husband by the law so long as he lives; but if the husband may die, she is free from the law of the husband.
045	ROM	007	003	Then if she may be married to another man, her husband still living, she will be designated an adulteress: but if her husband may die, she is free from the law; and is no adulteress, though she is married to another man.
045	ROM	007	004	So, my brethren, ye are dead to the law through the body of Christ, that ye should be married to another, to him who is risen from the dead, in order that we may bring forth fruit unto God.
045	ROM	007	005	For when we were in carnality, the emotions of sins, which were through the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.
045	ROM	007	006	But now we have been made free from the law, being dead in that in which we were held; so that we serve in the newness of the spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.
045	ROM	007	007	Then what shall we say? is the law sin? It could not be so; but I did not know sin except through the law: for indeed I had not known lusts, unless the law said, Thou shalt not covet.
045	ROM	007	008	But sin, taking occasion through the commandment, did work in me all concupiscence; for without law sin was dead.
045	ROM	007	009	But I was alive at one time without law: but the commandment having come, sin revived,
045	ROM	007	010	and I died; and the commandment, which was unto life, the same was unto death.
045	ROM	007	011	For sin, taking occasion through the commandment, deceived me, and through it slew me.
045	ROM	007	012	So the law is indeed holy, and the commandment holy, and righteous, and good.
045	ROM	007	013	Then did that which is good become death to me? it could not be so: but sin, that it may appear sin, through the good was working out death to me, in order that sin may be exceedingly sinful through the commandment.
045	ROM	007	014	For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, having been sold under sin.
045	ROM	007	015	For that which I do, I know not: for I do that which I do not will; but I do that which I hate.
045	ROM	007	016	But if I do that which I do not will, I consent to the law that it is beautiful;
045	ROM	007	017	but now it is no more I that do it, but sin dwelling in me.
045	ROM	007	018	For I know that in me, that is, in my carnal mind, there dwells no good thing. For to will is present with me, but to do that which is beautiful is not:
045	ROM	007	019	for the good which I will I do not; but the evil which I do not will, that I do.
045	ROM	007	020	If I do that which I do not will, it is no longer I that do it, but sin dwelling in me.
045	ROM	007	021	Then I find a law, that, to me wishing to do that which is beautiful, that the evil is present with me:
045	ROM	007	022	for I delight in the law of God according to the inward man;
045	ROM	007	023	but I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.
045	ROM	007	024	O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?
045	ROM	007	025	Thanks be unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord: then therefore with the mind I serve the law of God; but with carnality the law of sin.
045	ROM	008	001	There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus.
045	ROM	008	002	For the law of the Spirit of life has made thee free from the law of sin and of death.
045	ROM	008	003	For there was an impotency of the law, in which it was weak through depravity, God having sent his own Son in the likeness of the sin of depravity and for sin, condemned sin in depravity:
045	ROM	008	004	in order that the righteousness of the law may be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to depravity, but according to the spirit.
045	ROM	008	005	For those being in harmony with depravity, do mind the things of depravity, and those in harmony with the Spirit, the things of the Spirit:
045	ROM	008	006	for the mind of depravity is death: and the mind of the Spirit is life and peace.
045	ROM	008	007	Therefore the mind of depravity is enmity toward God: for it is not subordinated to the law of God, for it is not able so to be.
045	ROM	008	008	But those being in depravity are not able to please God.
045	ROM	008	009	But ye are not in depravity, but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if any one has not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His.
045	ROM	008	010	But if Christ is in you, the body is dead so far as sin is concerned; but the Spirit is life so far as righteousness is concerned.
045	ROM	008	011	But if the Spirit of Him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, the one having raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also create life in your mortal bodies through His Spirit, who dwells in you.
045	ROM	008	012	Then therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to depravity, to live according to depravity.
045	ROM	008	013	For if you live according to depravity, you are about to die: but if through the Spirit you kill the practices of the body, you shall live.
045	ROM	008	014	For so many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are the sons of God.
045	ROM	008	015	For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again unto fear; but you received the Spirit of adoption, in which we cry; Father, Father.
045	ROM	008	016	The Spirit Himself witnesses along with our spirit, that we are the children of God.
045	ROM	008	017	And if children, indeed heirs; truly heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ; if we suffer together, in order that we may also be glorified together.
045	ROM	008	018	For I reckon that the sufferings of these present times are not worthy to be compared to the glory which is about to be revealed in us.
045	ROM	008	019	For the earnest expectation of the creature awaits the revelation of the sons of God.
045	ROM	008	020	For the creature has been subordinated to mortality, not willingly, but through Him who subordinated it;
045	ROM	008	021	therefore indeed pursuant to hope, the creature itself shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.
045	ROM	008	022	For we know that all creation groans together and travails together until now;
045	ROM	008	023	and not only so, but we ourselves, having the earnest of the Spirit, and we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption of sons, the redemption of our body.
045	ROM	008	024	For we are saved by hope: but hope which is seen is not hope: for why does any one indeed hope for that which he sees?
045	ROM	008	025	But if we hope for that which we do not see, we wait for it with patience.
045	ROM	008	026	And likewise the Spirit also helps our infirmity. For we know not what we should pray for as it behooves us: but the Spirit himself makes intercession with unutterable groanings:
045	ROM	008	027	but he that searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because he makes intercession towards God in behalf of the saints.
045	ROM	008	028	But we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them that are called according to his purpose.
045	ROM	008	029	Because whom he did foreknow, he did also predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brethren:
045	ROM	008	030	and whom He did foreknow, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them He also glorified.
045	ROM	008	031	Then what shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?
045	ROM	008	032	Indeed he who spared not his own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how will He not with him, freely give us all things?
045	ROM	008	033	Who will lay anything to the charge of God's elect?
045	ROM	008	034	It is God who justifies: who is he that condemns? It is Christ who died, and rather who is risen, who is on the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding in our behalf.
045	ROM	008	035	Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
045	ROM	008	036	As has been written, that We are killed all day for thy sake; we are counted as sheep of the slaughter.
045	ROM	008	037	But in all these we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.
045	ROM	008	038	For I am persuaded that, neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come,
045	ROM	008	039	nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
045	ROM	009	001	I speak the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,
045	ROM	009	002	that there is great sorrow to me and incessant grief to my heart.
045	ROM	009	003	For I would pray, that I myself might be an offering from Christ; in behalf of my brethren, my kindred according to the flesh:
045	ROM	009	004	who are Israelites, of whom is the adoption of sons, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service, and the promises:
045	ROM	009	005	of whom are the fathers, and of whom is Christ according to the flesh. Who is over all, God blessed forever: amen.
045	ROM	009	006	But not as that the word of God has been a failure. For these are not all Israel who are of Israel;
045	ROM	009	007	neither are the children all the seed of Abraham; but in Isaac shall thy seed be called;
045	ROM	009	008	that is the children of the flesh the same are not the children of God; but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.
045	ROM	009	009	For this is the word of the promise, About this time I will come, and there shall be a son to Sarah.
045	ROM	009	010	Not only so; but Rebecca also having cohabitation of one, our father Isaac;
045	ROM	009	011	for the children not having been born, neither having done anything good or evil, in order that the purpose of God might stand according to election not of works, but of him that calleth,
045	ROM	009	012	and it was said to her, The elder shall serve the younger:
045	ROM	009	013	as has been written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.
045	ROM	009	014	Then what shall we say? Is there unrighteousness with God? It could not be so.
045	ROM	009	015	For he says to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I do have mercy, and I will commiserate whom I do commiserate.
045	ROM	009	016	Then it is not of him that willeth, nor him that runneth, but of God who shows mercy.
045	ROM	009	017	For the scripture says to Pharaoh, For this very thing have I raised you up, that I may show forth my power in you, and that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth.
045	ROM	009	018	Then therefore he has mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardens.
045	ROM	009	019	Then thou wilt say to me, Why does he yet find fault? For who has resisted his will?
045	ROM	009	020	O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Whether shall the thing formed say to him that formed it. Why did you make me thus?
045	ROM	009	021	Has not the potter the right of the clay, from the same lump to make one part a vessel unto honor, and another unto dishonor?
045	ROM	009	022	But if God, wishing to show forth his indignation and make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of indignation having been perfected unto destruction:
045	ROM	009	023	and in order that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he before prepared unto glory?
045	ROM	009	024	whom he called, even us, not only of the Jews, but also of the Gentiles:
045	ROM	009	025	as he says in Hosea, I will call them my people, who are not my people; and her beloved, who is not beloved:
045	ROM	009	026	and it shall come to pass, in the place in which it was said to them, You are not my people, there they shall be called the sons of the living God:
045	ROM	009	027	but Isaiah cries out in behalf of Israel, Though the number of sons of Israel may be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved.
045	ROM	009	028	For perfecting the word and cutting it short, will the Lord do a complete work on the earth:
045	ROM	009	029	and as Isaiah has before spoken; Unless the Lord of Sabaoth left to us a seed, we would have become as Sodom, and would have been made like unto Gomorrah:
045	ROM	009	030	Then what shall we say? That the Gentiles, not pursuing righteousness, received righteousness, and the righteousness which is from faith:
045	ROM	009	031	but Israel, following after the law, did not attain unto the law of righteousness.
045	ROM	009	032	Why? Because they sought it not from faith, but as it were from works: they stumbled over the stone of stumbling,
045	ROM	009	033	as has been written, Behold, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence: and he that believeth on him shall not be ashamed.
045	ROM	010	001	Brethren, indeed the desire of my heart and my prayer to God in their behalf, is for their salvation.
045	ROM	010	002	For I testify to them, that they have a zeal of God, but not according to perfect knowledge;
045	ROM	010	003	for being ignorant of God's righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted to the righteousness of God.
045	ROM	010	004	For Christ is the end of the law unto righteousness to every one who believes.
045	ROM	010	005	For Moses describes the righteousness which is of the law, that the man having done this shall live in it.
045	ROM	010	006	But the righteousness of faith speaks thus, Say not in thy heart, Who shall ascend up into heaven? that is, to bring Christ down:
045	ROM	010	007	or, Who shall descend into the abyss? that is, to bring him up from the dead.
045	ROM	010	008	But what says it? The word is nigh thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach.
045	ROM	010	009	That if you may confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and may believe with your heart that God raised him from the dead, you shall be saved:
045	ROM	010	010	for with the heart it is believed unto righteousness; and with the mouth it is confessed unto salvation.
045	ROM	010	011	For the scripture says, Every one believing on him shall not be ashamed.
045	ROM	010	012	For there is no difference between Jew and Greek: for the same is Lord of all, rich unto all that call on him.
045	ROM	010	013	For every one who may call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
045	ROM	010	014	Then how can they call on him on whom they have not believed? and how can they believe on him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?
045	ROM	010	015	And how can they preach, unless they may be sent forth? as has been written, How beautiful are the feet of those, who preach the gospel of good things!
045	ROM	010	016	But they have not all heard the gospel. For Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed our report?
045	ROM	010	017	Then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.
045	ROM	010	018	But I say, Have they not all heard? Yea, truly, Their sound has gone out into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.
045	ROM	010	019	But I say, Whether does not Israel know? Moses first says, I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation, and with a nation void of understanding I will anger you.
045	ROM	010	020	But Isaiah is bold, and says, I was found by those not seeking after me; and made manifest to those not inquiring after me.
045	ROM	010	021	But to Israel he says, All day long have I reached forth my hands to a gainsaying and disobedient people.
045	ROM	011	001	Then I say, Did God cast away his people? it could not be so. For I am indeed an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
045	ROM	011	002	God did not cast away his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the scripture says in Elijah, how he makes intercession to God against Israel?
045	ROM	011	003	Lord, they have slain thy prophets, they have digged down thine altars: and I am left alone, and they are seeking my life.
045	ROM	011	004	But what says the answer to him? I have left unto myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal.
045	ROM	011	005	Thus then there is even at this time a remnant left according to the election of grace:
045	ROM	011	006	and if by grace, it is not at all by works: since in that case grace is no more grace.
045	ROM	011	007	What then? Israel did not attain that which he was seeking, but the election obtained it, and the rest were hardened:
045	ROM	011	008	as has been written, God has given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, unto this day.
045	ROM	011	009	And David says, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompense unto them:
045	ROM	011	010	and let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back always.
045	ROM	011	011	Then I say; Whether did they stumble that they may fall? it could not be so: but by their fall, salvation came to the Gentiles, in order to provoke them to jealousy.
045	ROM	011	012	But if the fall of them was the riches of the world, and the depletion of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?
045	ROM	011	013	But I speak to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of the Gentiles, I glorify my ministry:
045	ROM	011	014	if perchance I may provoke my flesh, and save some of them.
045	ROM	011	015	For if the casting away of them was the reconciling of the world, what will their reception be, but life from the dead?
045	ROM	011	016	But if the first fruit was holy, the lump is also: if the root was holy, the branches are also.
045	ROM	011	017	And if certain ones of the branches were broken off, and you being a wild olive-tree are grafted in among them, and have become a partaker of the root of the fatness of the olive-tree;
045	ROM	011	018	boast not against the branches: but if you boast, you are not bearing the root, but the root you.
045	ROM	011	019	Then you will say, The branches were broken off, that I may be grafted in.
045	ROM	011	020	Beautifully; they were broken off by unbelief, but you stand by faith, Think not high things, but fear.
045	ROM	011	021	For if God spared not the natural branches, neither will he spare you.
045	ROM	011	022	Then behold the goodness and severity of God: upon those who fell indeed, severity; but upon you the goodness of God, if you may abide in his goodness: since you too may be cut off.
045	ROM	011	023	But these also, if they may not abide in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.
045	ROM	011	024	For if you, having been cut off the olive tree which is wild by nature, and contrary to nature were grafted into the good olive tree: how much more shall these, who are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?
045	ROM	011	025	I do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, as to this mystery, in order that you may not he wise with yourselves, that blindness in part has happened unto Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles may come in;
045	ROM	011	026	and so all Israel shall be saved: as has been written, A leader shall come out of Zion, shall turn ungodliness from Jacob.
045	ROM	011	027	And this is the covenant with me unto them, that I may take away their sins.
045	ROM	011	028	They are enemies indeed, as touching the gospel, for your sakes: but beloved with reference to election for the sake of the fathers:
045	ROM	011	029	for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.
045	ROM	011	030	For as you at one time were disobedient to God, but now you have received mercy through their disobedience,
045	ROM	011	031	even also these were now disobedient, in order that through the mercy shown to you they themselves may now also obtain mercy.
045	ROM	011	032	For God has shut up all in unbelief, in order that he may have mercy on all.
045	ROM	011	033	O the depth of the riches of the wisdom of the knowledge of God! His judgments are unsearchable, and his ways past tracing out.
045	ROM	011	034	For who has known the mind of the Lord? who became his counsellor?
045	ROM	011	035	or who has given unto him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?
045	ROM	011	036	Because of Him, and through him, and unto him, are all things: to him be glory forever: amen.
045	ROM	012	001	I exhort you, therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, your reasonable service:
045	ROM	012	002	and he not fashioned after this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.
045	ROM	012	003	For I speak, through the grace which has been given unto me, for every one who is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, as God has imparted to each one the measure of faith.
045	ROM	012	004	For we indeed have many members in one body, but all the members have not the same office:
045	ROM	012	005	so we, being many, are one body in Christ, and members one of another.
045	ROM	012	006	But having gifts differing according to the grace given unto us, whether prophecy, it is according to the analogy of faith;
045	ROM	012	007	or ministry, it is in the ministry; or he that teacheth, in teaching;
045	ROM	012	008	or he that exhorteth, in exhortation; or he that giveth, with a single eye; he that presideth, with diligence; he that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness.
045	ROM	012	009	Let love be free from hypocrisy. Abhorring the evil, cleaving to the good:
045	ROM	012	010	kindly affectionate one to another with brotherly love; in honor preferring one another;
045	ROM	012	011	not slothful in business; boiling over in spirit; serving the Lord;
045	ROM	012	012	rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing steadfastly in prayer;
045	ROM	012	013	communicating to necessities of the saints; pursuing hospitality.
045	ROM	012	014	Bless them that persecute you; bless, and scold not.
045	ROM	012	015	Rejoice with them that rejoice; weep with them that weep.
045	ROM	012	016	Have the same mind toward one another, not thinking high things, but condescending to the humble. Be not wise in your own conceits.
045	ROM	012	017	Returning to no one evil for evil; providing things beautiful in the sight of all men.
045	ROM	012	018	If possible, so far as it is within your power, living in peace with all men;
045	ROM	012	019	avenging not yourselves, beloved, but give place to wrath; for it has been written, Vengeance belongs to me; I will repay, says the Lord.
045	ROM	012	020	But if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him drink: for doing this you will heap coals of fire upon his head.
045	ROM	012	021	Be not overcome by the evil, but overcome the evil with the good.
045	ROM	013	001	Let every soul be subject to the higher authorities. For there is no authority except that which is from God; and the existing authorities have been ordained of God.
045	ROM	013	002	So the one resisting the authority, antagonizes the ordinance of God: and those antagonizing shall receive to themselves judgment.
045	ROM	013	003	For rulers are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. Whether do you not wish to fear the authority? do the good, and you shall have praise from it:
045	ROM	013	004	for he is the minister of God for you for good. But if you do evil, fear; for he bears not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, executing judgment unto wrath unto the one doing evil.
045	ROM	013	005	Therefore it is necessary to submit, not only on account of wrath, but also on account of conscience.
045	ROM	013	006	For on account of this also pay tribute; for they are the ministers of God, attending to this very thing.
045	ROM	013	007	Give to all their dues: custom to whom custom is due; tribute to whom tribute is due; fear to whom fear is due; honor to whom honor is due.
045	ROM	013	008	Owe no man anything, but to love one another with divine love: for the one loving another with divine love has fulfilled the law.
045	ROM	013	009	For, thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not murder, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not covet, and if there is any other commandment, it is fulfilled in this word, in this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself with divine love.
045	ROM	013	010	Divine love works no evil to its neighbor: for divine love is the fulfilling of the law.
045	ROM	013	011	And recognizing this time, that it is already the hour we should wake out of sleep: for now our salvation is nearer than when we believed.
045	ROM	013	012	For the night is far spent, and the day is at hand. Therefore let us lay aside the works of the darkness, and let us put on the arms of the light.
045	ROM	013	013	Let us walk circumspectly, as in the day; not with revelries and drunkenness, not with debaucheries and impurities, not in strife and envy:
045	ROM	013	014	but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the lust of the flesh.
045	ROM	014	001	But receive to yourselves him who is weak in faith, not into disputations of doubtful matters.
045	ROM	014	002	One indeed believes he is to eat all things: another who is weak, vegetables.
045	ROM	014	003	Let not the one eating snub the one not eating. Let not the one not eating judge the one eating; for God received him.
045	ROM	014	004	Who art thou judging another man's servant? to his own master he stands or falls: but he shall stand; for God is able to make him stand.
045	ROM	014	005	For one indeed judges a day above a day: another judges every day (alike); let each one be fully persuaded in his own mind.
045	ROM	014	006	The one regarding the day, regards it to the Lord: the one eating, eats to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and the one not eating, eats not to the Lord, and gives thanks to God.
045	ROM	014	007	For no one of us lives to himself, and no one dies to himself:
045	ROM	014	008	for if indeed we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord. Then indeed if we live, and if we die, we are the Lord's.
045	ROM	014	009	For unto this Christ died, and lives, in order that He may be Lord of the dead and of the living.
045	ROM	014	010	But why do you judge your neighbor, or indeed why do you discount your brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of God.
045	ROM	014	011	For it has been written; As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.
045	ROM	014	012	Then therefore each one of us shall give an account to God for himself.
045	ROM	014	013	Then let us no longer judge one another: but rather judge this, not to place before a brother an offence for a stumblingblock.
045	ROM	014	014	I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: except to him who considers it unclean, to him it is unclean.
045	ROM	014	015	But if your brother is grieved on account of your meat, you are no longer walking in divine love. Do not by your meat destroy him for whom Christ died.
045	ROM	014	016	Let not your good be blasphemed.
045	ROM	014	017	For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.
045	ROM	014	018	For in this the one serving Christ is acceptable to God, and approved unto men.
045	ROM	014	019	Then therefore we pursue the things belonging to peace, and edification towards one another.
045	ROM	014	020	Do not destroy the work of God on account of meat. All things are pure; but it is evil to the man who eats with offence:
045	ROM	014	021	it is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor anything by which your brother stumbles.
045	ROM	014	022	The faith which you have, have it with yourself before God. Happy is the one not judging himself in that which he approves:
045	ROM	014	023	but if he may eat doubting, he has been condemned, because it is not of faith; but every thing which is not of faith is sin.
045	ROM	015	001	But we who are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.
045	ROM	015	002	Let each of us please his neighbor in that which is good, unto edification;
045	ROM	015	003	for Christ did not please himself; but, as has been written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.
045	ROM	015	004	For so many things as were previously written were written for our instruction, in order that through the patience and through the consolation of the scriptures we may have hope.
045	ROM	015	005	But may the God of patience and consolation grant unto you to think the same things among one another with reference to Christ Jesus.
045	ROM	015	006	In order that you may with one accord with one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
045	ROM	015	007	Therefore receive one another, as Christ also received you, to the glory of God.
045	ROM	015	008	For I say that Christ has been made minister of circumcision for the truth of God, that he might confirm the promises of the fathers,
045	ROM	015	009	and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as has been written, Therefore I will confess thee among the Gentiles, and in thy name sing praises.
045	ROM	015	010	And again he says, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.
045	ROM	015	011	And again, Let all the Gentiles praise the Lord; and let all ye peoples praise him.
045	ROM	015	012	And again, Isaiah says, There shall be the root of Jesse, and he that ariseth to rule over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles hope.
045	ROM	015	013	And the God of hope fill you in all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, in the power of the Holy Ghost.
045	ROM	015	014	But I am indeed persuaded, my brethren, concerning you, that you are also full of goodness, having been filled with all knowledge, being able also to admonish one another.
045	ROM	015	015	But I have written unto you more boldly in part, as reminding you, on account of the grace which has been given unto me from God,
045	ROM	015	016	that I should be the minister of Christ Jesus unto the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering of the Gentiles may be well received, having been sanctified by the Holy Ghost.
045	ROM	015	017	Moreover I have boldness in Christ Jesus as to the things appertaining to God:
045	ROM	015	018	for I will not dare to speak anything save those things which Christ has wrought through me, unto the obedience of the Gentiles, in word and deed,
045	ROM	015	019	in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Spirit of God, so that from Jerusalem, and around about even unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ;
045	ROM	015	020	but being so ambitious not to preach the gospel, where Christ has been named, in order that I may not build on another man's foundation;
045	ROM	015	021	but, as has been written, Those, to whom he has not been preached, shall see concerning him, and they who have not heard shall understand.
045	ROM	015	022	Therefore indeed I was hindered much from coming unto you:
045	ROM	015	023	but now, no longer having a place in these regions, and having an earnest longing for many years to come to you,
045	ROM	015	024	as I may journey into Spain, for I hope traveling through to see you, and by you to be sent forth thither, if in the first place I may be satisfied with your companyâ€”
045	ROM	015	025	but now I journey to Jerusalem, ministering to the saints.
045	ROM	015	026	For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make a certain contribution to the poor who are in Jerusalem.
045	ROM	015	027	For they were pleased to do so; and they are their debtors: for if the Gentiles participated in spiritual things, they owe it to them also to minister unto them in carnal things.
045	ROM	015	028	Then having completed and sealed this fruit unto them, I will sail away for Spain by you;
045	ROM	015	029	but I know that coming unto you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.
045	ROM	015	030	But I exhort you, brethren, through our Lord Jesus Christ, and through the love of the Spirit, that you cooperate with me in your prayers to God in my behalf;
045	ROM	015	031	in order that I may be delivered from those in Judea who do not believe, and my ministry may be acceptable to the saints in Jerusalem;
045	ROM	015	032	in order that having come to you in joy through the will of God, and together with you find rest.
045	ROM	015	033	Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
045	ROM	016	001	I commend unto you our sister Phoebe, being a minister of the church which is in Cenchrea,
045	ROM	016	002	in order that you may receive her in the Lord, worthily of the saints, and that ye may assist her in whatsoever matters she may need you: for she has been a helper of many, and myself.
045	ROM	016	003	Salute Prisca and Aquila my fellow-laborers in Christ Jesus;
045	ROM	016	004	who laid down their neck for my life; and for whom not I alone hut all the churches of the Gentiles give thanks;
045	ROM	016	005	and the church in their house. Salute Epaenetus my beloved, who is the first fruit of Asia unto Christ.
045	ROM	016	006	Salute Mary, who labored much for you.
045	ROM	016	007	Salute Andronicus and Junias, my kinsman and my fellow-soldiers, who are celebrated among the apostles, who were also in Christ before me.
045	ROM	016	008	Salute Ampliatus my beloved in the Lord.
045	ROM	016	009	Salute Urbanus our fellow-worker in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.
045	ROM	016	010	Salute Apelles the reproved in Christ. Salute those of the household of Aristobulus.
045	ROM	016	011	Salute Herodian my kinsman. Salute those from the household of Narcissus, who are in the Lord.
045	ROM	016	012	Salute Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who are laboring in the Lord. Salute the beloved Persis, who labored much in the Lord.
045	ROM	016	013	Salute Rufus the elect in the Lord, and his mother and mine.
045	ROM	016	014	Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brethren along with them.
045	ROM	016	015	Salute Philologus and Julius, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who were with them.
045	ROM	016	016	Salute one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ salute you.
045	ROM	016	017	But I exhort you, brethren, to mark those who cause divisions and stumblings, contrary to the teaching which you have learned, and depart from them.
045	ROM	016	018	For such do not serve our Lord Christ, but their own stomach; and through fair speeches and eulogies deceive the hearts of the innocent.
045	ROM	016	019	For your obedience has come abroad unto all men: therefore I rejoice over you, and wish you to be wise in that which is good, and uncompromising towards that which is evil.
045	ROM	016	020	The God of peace will speedily crush Satan beneath your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you.
045	ROM	016	021	Timothy my fellow-laborer salutes you; and Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, my consanguinity, salute you.
045	ROM	016	022	I Tertius, the one writing the epistle, salute you in the Lord.
045	ROM	016	023	Gaius my host, and that of the whole church salutes you. Erastus the steward of the city, and brother Quartus, salute you.
045	ROM	016	025	To Him who is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery having been hidden during the eternal times,
045	ROM	016	026	but having now indeed been made manifest, through the prophetical scriptures, and having been made known to all the Gentiles, according to the commandment of the eternal God, unto the obedience of faith;
045	ROM	016	027	to God who alone is wise, through Jesus Christ, to the glory unto the ages of the ages. Amen.

046	1CO	001	001	Paul, called an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and brother Sosthenes,
046	1CO	001	002	to the church of God being in Corinth, to the sanctified in Christ Jesus, to the called saints, along with all who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, theirs and ours:
046	1CO	001	003	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
046	1CO	001	004	I give thanks to my God always in your behalf, for the grace of God given unto you in Christ Jesus;
046	1CO	001	005	because in everything you are enriched in him, in all speech and in all knowledge;
046	1CO	001	006	as the testimony of Christ is confirmed in you;
046	1CO	001	007	so that you are deficient in no spiritual gift; awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ;
046	1CO	001	008	who will also establish you unblamable unto the end in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
046	1CO	001	009	God is faithful, through whom you have been called unto the fellowship of His Son our Lord Jesus Christ.
046	1CO	001	010	But I exhort you, brethren, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you may all speak the same things, and that there may be no schisms among you; but you may be perfected in the same mind and in the same disposition.
046	1CO	001	011	For it has been revealed to me concerning you, my brethren, by those who are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.
046	1CO	001	012	And I say this, that each one says, I indeed am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.
046	1CO	001	013	Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were you baptized in the name of Paul?
046	1CO	001	014	I thank God that I baptized none of you, except Crispus and Gaius;
046	1CO	001	015	in order that no one may say that you are baptized in my name.
046	1CO	001	016	But I baptized also the family of Stephanas: besides, I know not if I baptized any other.
046	1CO	001	017	For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with the wisdom of speech, in order that the cross of Christ may not be made of none effect.
046	1CO	001	018	For the word of the cross is foolishness indeed to those who are lost; but to those who are saved it is the power of God.
046	1CO	001	019	For it has been written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and bring to nought the understanding of the intelligent.
046	1CO	001	020	Where is the wise man? where is the scribe? where is the investigator of this age? has not God rendered the wisdom of the world foolishness?
046	1CO	001	021	For since in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, God was pleased through the foolishness of preaching to save those who believe.
046	1CO	001	022	Since indeed the Jews ask for miracles, and the Greeks seek after wisdom;
046	1CO	001	023	but we preach Christ having been crucified, to the Jews indeed a stumbling block, and to the Gentiles foolishness;
046	1CO	001	024	but to you who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.
046	1CO	001	025	Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
046	1CO	001	026	For you see your calling, brethren, that there are not many wise according to the flesh, not many influential, not many high-born:
046	1CO	001	027	but God has chosen the foolish things of the world, that he may confound the wise; and God has chosen the weak things of the world, that he may confound the strong;
046	1CO	001	028	and God has chosen the base-born of the world, and those of no reputation, the things which are not, that He may set at nought the things which are,
046	1CO	001	029	in order that no flesh can boast in the sight of God.
046	1CO	001	030	But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God was made unto us wisdom, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption:
046	1CO	001	031	in order that, as it has been written, Let him that glorieth glory in the Lord.
046	1CO	002	001	And I, brethren, having come unto you, came not in the excellency of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming unto you the testimony of God.
046	1CO	002	002	For I determine to know nothing among you, except Jesus Christ, and Him having been crucified.
046	1CO	002	003	I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.
046	1CO	002	004	And my speech and my preaching were not in the persuasive words of wisdom, but in the demonstration of the Spirit and the power:
046	1CO	002	005	in order that your faith may not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
046	1CO	002	006	But we speak wisdom among the perfect: not the wisdom of this age, nor of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nought:
046	1CO	002	007	but we speak the wisdom of God having been hidden in a mystery, which God predestinated before the ages unto our glory:
046	1CO	002	008	which no one of the princes of this age knew; for if they had known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
046	1CO	002	009	But, as has been written, the things which eye has not seen, and ear has not heard, and has not entered into the heart of man, the things which God has prepared for those who love Him.
046	1CO	002	010	But God has revealed them to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.
046	1CO	002	011	For who of men knows the things of man, except the spirit of the man which is in him? so indeed no one knows the things of God, except the Spirit of God.
046	1CO	002	012	But we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God; in order that we may know the things which have been graciously given unto us from God.
046	1CO	002	013	Which things indeed we speak, not in the teachable words of human wisdom, but in the teachable words of the Spirit, expounding spiritual things to spiritual people.
046	1CO	002	014	But the intellectual man receives not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness unto him; and he is not able to know them, because they are spiritually discerned.
046	1CO	002	015	But the spiritual man discerns all things, and is himself discerned by no one.
046	1CO	002	016	For who knows the mind of the Lord, who shall give him counsel? But we have the mind of Christ.
046	1CO	003	001	And I, brethren, was not able to speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even babes in Christ.
046	1CO	003	002	I have fed you with milk, not with meat; for you were not yet able. But ye are not now yet able:
046	1CO	003	003	for ye are yet carnal. For where there are envy and strife among you, are you not carnal, and walking about according to man?
046	1CO	003	004	For when one may say, I am indeed of Paul; another, I am of Apollos; are you not men?
046	1CO	003	005	Then what is Apollos? and what is Paul? But ministers through whom ye believed; even as the Lord gave to each one.
046	1CO	003	006	I planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.
046	1CO	003	007	So neither is the one planting, nor the one watering anything, but God the one giving the increase.
046	1CO	003	008	But he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and each one shall receive his own reward according to his own labor.
046	1CO	003	009	For we are God's fellow-laborers; ye are God's farm; ye are God's building.
046	1CO	003	010	According to the grace of God which was given unto me, I as a wise architect, laid the foundation; and another builds on it. Let each one take heed how he builds.
046	1CO	003	011	For other foundation no one is able to lay beside the one which is laid, who is Jesus Christ.
046	1CO	003	012	But if any one builds upon the foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;
046	1CO	003	013	the work of each will be made manifest: for the day will reveal it, because it is revealed by fire; and the same fire will try the work of each what soil it is.
046	1CO	003	014	And if the work of any one which he builds, abides, he will receive a reward:
046	1CO	003	015	But if the work of any one shall be burnt up, he shall suffer loss; but himself shall be saved, but as through the fire.
046	1CO	003	016	Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwells in you?
046	1CO	003	017	If any one destroys the temple of God, him will God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which ye are.
046	1CO	003	018	Let no one deceive himself. If any one seems to be wise among you in this age, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.
046	1CO	003	019	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it has been written. He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.
046	1CO	003	020	And again, The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.
046	1CO	003	021	So let no one boast among men; for all things are yours;
046	1CO	003	022	whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come.
046	1CO	003	023	All things are yours; and ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.
046	1CO	004	001	So let a man consider us, as ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.
046	1CO	004	002	Here, moreover, it is required among stewards, that every one must be found faithful.
046	1CO	004	003	But to me it is the smallest matter, that I may be judged by you, or by human day: but I do not judge myself.
046	1CO	004	004	For I know nothing against myself; but in this I am not justified; and the Lord is the one judging me.
046	1CO	004	005	So judge nothing before the time, until the Lord may come, who will also bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then praise shall be to each one from God.
046	1CO	004	006	But, brethren, I have transferred these things to myself and Apollos on your account: that you may learn among us not to be wise above what is written; in order that you may not be puffed up one in behalf of one against another.
046	1CO	004	007	For who judges you? and what have you which you did not receive. But if indeed you received it, why do you boast, as not having received it?
046	1CO	004	008	Already are ye filled, already have ye become rich; you did reign without us: and I would indeed that you did reign, in order that we also might reign along with you.
046	1CO	004	009	For, I think, God has exhibited us apostles the last, as exposed to death: that we may become a theater to the world, and to angels, and to men.
046	1CO	004	010	We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are glorious, but we are dishonorable.
046	1CO	004	011	until this hour we both hunger and thirst, and suffer for insufficient clothing, and are buffeted; and we tramp,
046	1CO	004	012	and we toil working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure it;
046	1CO	004	013	being scandalized, we entreat: we have become as the offscourings of the world, the refuse of all things until now.
046	1CO	004	014	I do not write these things shaming you, but admonishing you as my beloved children.
046	1CO	004	015	For if you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, but you have not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.
046	1CO	004	016	Therefore I exhort you, be ye imitators of me.
046	1CO	004	017	For this same thing I sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways which are in Christ Jesus, as I teach everywhere in every church.
046	1CO	004	018	But some were inflated, as if I was not coming unto you.
046	1CO	004	019	But I will come to you quickly, if the Lord may will; and I will know not the word of those who have been puffed up, but the power.
046	1CO	004	020	For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.
046	1CO	004	021	What do you wish? must I come unto you with the rod, or in divine love and the spirit of meekness?
046	1CO	005	001	Fornication is truly heard of among you, and such fornication which is not among the heathens, that one should have the wife of his father.
046	1CO	005	002	And have you been inflated, and have not rather mourned, that the one having done this work may be taken from your midst?
046	1CO	005	003	For indeed I, being absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged the one having thus done this, as being present,
046	1CO	005	004	in the name of the Lord Jesus, you and my spirit being assembled, with the power of the Lord Jesus,
046	1CO	005	005	to turn over such a one to Satan for the destruction of carnality, in order that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
046	1CO	005	006	Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?
046	1CO	005	007	Cleanse away the old leaven, in order that you may be a new lump, as you are free from leaven; for Christ has truly become our Passover.
046	1CO	005	008	So let us feast, not on the old leaven, nor on the leaven of sin and iniquity, but on the unleavened bread of purity and truth.
046	1CO	005	009	I have written unto you in a letter to have no fellowship with fornicators;
046	1CO	005	010	not at all with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous and the extortioners, or with the idolators; since you ought therefore to come out of the world.
046	1CO	005	011	For now I have written unto you not to keep company with him, if any one denominated a brother may be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a scold, or drunken, or an extortioner; with such a one not to eat.
046	1CO	005	012	For why is it for me to judge the outsiders? Do you not judge those within? But God will judge those without.
046	1CO	005	013	Take away the wicked person from you, yourselves.
046	1CO	006	001	Which one of you having a matter dares to go to law with another before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?
046	1CO	006	002	Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? and if the world is judged by you, are you unworthy of the smallest judgments?
046	1CO	006	003	Do you not know that we shall judge angels, not indeed matters of this life?
046	1CO	006	004	Then if indeed you have judgments appertaining to this life, do you sit those down who are little esteemed in the church?
046	1CO	006	005	I speak this to your shame. Is there not one wise man among you who shall be able to judge between his brother?
046	1CO	006	006	But does brother go to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers?
046	1CO	006	007	Indeed it is already altogether a small matter to you, that you have law-suits one with another. Why do you not rather stiffer injustice? why are you not rather defrauded?
046	1CO	006	008	But you inflict injustice, and defraud, and that your brethren.
046	1CO	006	009	Do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? He not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor catamites, nor Sodomites,
046	1CO	006	010	nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor scolds, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.
046	1CO	006	011	And such were some of you: but you have washed, but you have been sanctified, but you have been justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and by the Spirit of our God.
046	1CO	006	012	All things are lawful to me, but all things are not profitable: all things are lawful, but I will not be brought under the power of any.
046	1CO	006	013	Meats for the stomach, and the stomach for meats: but God will destroy both this and them. The body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body:
046	1CO	006	014	but God both raised up the Lord, and will raise you up through his power.
046	1CO	006	015	Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? then taking the members of Christ, shall I make them the members of a harlot? it could not be so.
046	1CO	006	016	Do you not know that he who is joined to the harlot is one body? for it says, They two shall be one flesh.
046	1CO	006	017	But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.
046	1CO	006	018	Fly from fornication. Every sin which a man may commit is outside of his body; the one committing fornication sins against his own body.
046	1CO	006	019	Do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God? and you are not your own;
046	1CO	006	020	for you have been bought with a price: indeed glorify God in your body.
046	1CO	007	001	But concerning those things about which you wrote to me: That it is good for a man not to receive a wife:
046	1CO	007	002	but on account of fornication, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.
046	1CO	007	003	Let the husband give to the wife that which is due, and likewise the wife also to the husband.
046	1CO	007	004	The wife has not the authority over her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband has not the authority over his own body, but the wife.
046	1CO	007	005	Do not defraud one another, unless it may be with consent for a time, that you may give attention to prayer, and again come together, in order that Satan may not tempt you on account of your incontinency.
046	1CO	007	006	But I speak this according to knowledge, not according to commandment.
046	1CO	007	007	But I wish that all men were even as myself; but each one has his own gift from God, some one, and some another.
046	1CO	007	008	But I speak to the unmarried and the widows, that it is good for them that they may remain even as I:
046	1CO	007	009	but if they do not contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.
046	1CO	007	010	But I proclaim to those who have married, not I, but the Lord, That a wife shall not depart from her husband
046	1CO	007	011	(but if indeed she may depart, let her remain unmarried, or let her be reconciled unto her husband); and that the husband shall not send away the wife.
046	1CO	007	012	But I say to the rest, not the Lord, if any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she is willing to live with him, let him not send her away.
046	1CO	007	013	And if any wife has an unbelieving husband, and he is willing to live with her, let her not send away her husband.
046	1CO	007	014	For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified by the brother. Since then your children are unclean; but now they are holy.
046	1CO	007	015	But if the unbeliever departs, let him or her depart; the brother or the sister has not been enslaved in such things. God has called you in peace.
046	1CO	007	016	For what do you know, O wife, if you shall save your husband? And what do you know, O husband, if you shall save your wife?
046	1CO	007	017	If not as the Lord has imparted to each one, and as God has called each one, so let him or her walk. And thus I command in all the churches.
046	1CO	007	018	Is one called having been circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised: has one been called in uncircumcision? let him not get circumcised.
046	1CO	007	019	Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.
046	1CO	007	020	Let each one abide in the same calling in which he is called.
046	1CO	007	021	Have you been called being a slave? let it not be a care to you: but if indeed you are able to become free, use it in preference.
046	1CO	007	022	For the one having been called in the Lord, being a slave, is the Lord's freeman: likewise the one having been called, while free, is the slave of Christ.
046	1CO	007	023	You have been bought with a price; be not the slaves of men.
046	1CO	007	024	Let each one remain with the Lord, in the same calling in which he was called, brethren.
046	1CO	007	025	But concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: but I give knowledge, as one having obtained mercy from the Lord to be faithful.
046	1CO	007	026	But I consider this to be good on account of the present distress, that it is good for a man so to be.
046	1CO	007	027	Have you been given to a wife? do not seek separation; have you been separated from a wife? do not seek a wife.
046	1CO	007	028	But if, indeed you may marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin may marry, she has not sinned; but such shall have trouble in the flesh, but I spare you.
046	1CO	007	029	But I say this, brethren; that the time is at hand, that moreover indeed those having wives may be as those not having;
046	1CO	007	030	and those weeping, as those not weeping; and those rejoicing, as those not rejoicing; and those buying, as those not possessing;
046	1CO	007	031	and those using the world, as those not using it thoroughly: for the fashion of this world is passing away.
046	1CO	007	032	I wish you to be free from solicitude. The unmarried man cares for the things of the Lord, in order that he may please the Lord:
046	1CO	007	033	but the one having married cares for the things of the world, in order that he may please his wife.
046	1CO	007	034	A wife and a virgin truly also differ: the unmarried woman cares for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy in body and in spirit: but she having married cares for the things of the world, that she may please her husband.
046	1CO	007	035	I speak this for the profit of you yourselves; not that I may cast a burden upon you, but for that which is pleasing and acceptable to the Lord without perturbation.
046	1CO	007	036	But if any one considers that he is acting indiscreetly towards his virgin, if she may be marriageable, and thus it ought so to be, let him do what he wishes; he does not sin; let them marry.
046	1CO	007	037	But whosoever stands firm in his heart, having no necessity, and has the right according to his own will, and has determined this in his heart, to keep his virgin, will do well.
046	1CO	007	038	So indeed he that marries his own virgin does well; and he that marries her not will do better.
046	1CO	007	039	A wife has been given so long a time as her husband may live; but if her husband may die, she is free to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.
046	1CO	007	040	But she is happier if she may so remain, according to my opinion: but I realize that I truly have the Spirit of God.
046	1CO	008	001	But concerning things offered to idols: we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but divine love builds up.
046	1CO	008	002	If any one seems to know anything, yet he knows not as it behooves him to know;
046	1CO	008	003	but if any one loves God he is known of him.
046	1CO	008	004	Therefore concerning the eating of things offered to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no God except one.
046	1CO	008	005	For if indeed there are those who are called gods, whether in heaven or upon the earth; as there are gods many, and lords many;
046	1CO	008	006	but there is to us one God, the Father, from whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we in him.
046	1CO	008	007	But there is not knowledge in all people: but some, with the conscience of the idol even until now, eat as if it was sacrificed to the idol; and their conscience being weak is polluted.
046	1CO	008	008	But meat will not commend us to God; neither if we eat are we the better; nor if we eat not are we the worse.
046	1CO	008	009	See lest this liberty of yours may become a stumblingblock to the weak.
046	1CO	008	010	For if any one may see you having knowledge sitting at the table in the idol temple, will not the conscience of him, being weak, be encouraged to eat things sacrificed to the idols?
046	1CO	008	011	For the weak one is destroyed by your knowledge, the brother for whom Christ died.
046	1CO	008	012	And you, sinning so against the brethren, and wounding their weak conscience, are sinning against Christ.
046	1CO	008	013	If indeed meat causes my brother to stumble, I never eat any more meat, in order that I may not lay a stumblingblock in the way of my brother.
046	1CO	009	001	Am I not free? am I not an apostle? have I not seen the Lord Jesus? are you not my work in the Lord?
046	1CO	009	002	If I am not an apostle to others, but I am to you at least: for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.
046	1CO	009	003	My defence to those calling me in question is this.
046	1CO	009	004	Have we not a right to eat and drink?
046	1CO	009	005	Have we not a right to lead about a sister as a wife, as the other apostles also, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?
046	1CO	009	006	Have I and Barnabas alone not the right to forbear working?
046	1CO	009	007	Whoever goes to war at his own charges? who plants a vineyard, and does not eat the fruit of it? or who shepherdizes a flock, and does not eat of the milk of the flock?
046	1CO	009	008	Whether do I speak these things according to a man? or does not the law indeed say these things?
046	1CO	009	009	For in the law of Moses it has been written, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that plows. Is there a care to God for oxen,
046	1CO	009	010	or does he speak it altogether on account of us? For it was written on account of us, That the one plowing ought to plow in hope, and the one threshing in hope of partaking.
046	1CO	009	011	If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?
046	1CO	009	012	If others partake of your bounty, shall not we the more? But we have not used this privilege, but we bear all things, in order that we may not give a hindrance to the gospel of Christ.
046	1CO	009	013	Do you not know that those working in the sacrifices eat those things of the temple; and those serving the altar partake of the altar?
046	1CO	009	014	So also the Lord has commanded those preaching the gospel to live of the gospel.
046	1CO	009	015	But I have used none of these things. But I have not written these things that it may be so in me: for it is good for me rather to die than that any one shall make void my boasting.
046	1CO	009	016	For if I preach the gospel, there is no boasting to me; for necessity is laid upon me; for woe is unto me, if I may not preach the gospel.
046	1CO	009	017	For if I do this willingly, I have a reward: but if unwillingly, I have been intrusted with a dispensation.
046	1CO	009	018	Then what is my reward? that preaching the gospel, I may render the gospel free from charge, in order that I may not use my right in the gospel.
046	1CO	009	019	For being free from all, I rendered myself servant to all, that I may gain the more.
046	1CO	009	020	And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I may gain the Jews; to those under the law, as under the law, not myself being under law, that I may gain those under the law;
046	1CO	009	021	to those without law, I became as without law, not being without the law of God, but under the law of Christ, that I may gain those without law.
046	1CO	009	022	To the weak I became as weak, that I may gain the weak. I became all things to all men, that I may indeed save some.
046	1CO	009	023	But I do all these things for the sake of the gospel, that I may be its fellow-partaker.
046	1CO	009	024	Do you not know that those running in the stadium, indeed all run, and one receives the prize? So run, that you may receive it.
046	1CO	009	025	But every one contesting is abstinent in all things, they indeed also that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible.
046	1CO	009	026	I therefore so run, not as uncertainly, do I thus fight not as beating the air:
046	1CO	009	027	but I keep my body under, and enslave it, lest having preached the gospel to others, I myself may become disapproved.
046	1CO	010	001	For I do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;
046	1CO	010	002	and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea;
046	1CO	010	003	and they all did eat the same spiritual food;
046	1CO	010	004	and all did drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.
046	1CO	010	005	But with many of them God is not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.
046	1CO	010	006	And these became our examples, in order that we may not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.
046	1CO	010	007	Neither be ye idolaters, as some of them were; as has been written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and arose up to play.
046	1CO	010	008	Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed fornication, and fell in one day twenty-three thousand.
046	1CO	010	009	Neither let us tempt the Lord, as some of them tempted Him, and were destroyed by serpents.
046	1CO	010	010	Neither murmur, as some of them murmured, and were destroyed by the destroyer.
046	1CO	010	011	But these things happened unto them as examples; and were written for our admonition, on whom the ends of the ages have descended.
046	1CO	010	012	So let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he may fall.
046	1CO	010	013	No temptation has overtaken you, except that which is human: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above what you are able, but with the temptation, He will also make a way of escape, in order that you may be able to bear it.
046	1CO	010	014	Therefore, my beloved, fly from idolatry.
046	1CO	010	015	As I speak to the wise; judge ye what I say.
046	1CO	010	016	The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?
046	1CO	010	017	Because we, being many, are one bread, one body: for we all partake of one bread.
046	1CO	010	018	See Israel after the flesh: are not all eating the sacrifices communicants of the altar?
046	1CO	010	019	Then what do I say? that idolatry is anything? or that an idol is anything?
046	1CO	010	020	But those things which they sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God. But I do not wish you to be the communicants of demons.
046	1CO	010	021	You are not able to drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of demons: you are not able to partake of the table of the Lord, and the table of demons.
046	1CO	010	022	Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? whether are we stronger than he?
046	1CO	010	023	All things are lawful; but all things are not profitable. All things are lawful; but all things do not edify.
046	1CO	010	024	Let no one seek his own, but that of another.
046	1CO	010	025	Eat everything which is sold in market, asking no questions on account of conscience;
046	1CO	010	026	for the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness of the same.
046	1CO	010	027	If any one of the unbelievers invite you, and you wish to go; eat everything which is placed before you, asking no questions on account of conscience.
046	1CO	010	028	But if any one may say to you; This is offered to an idol, eat not, on account of him who gave the information, and his conscience.
046	1CO	010	029	But I say the conscience not of himself, but of the other one. For why is my liberty judged by the conscience of another?
046	1CO	010	030	If I partake with grace, why am I traduced for that over which I give thanks?
046	1CO	010	031	Then whether you eat, or whether you drink, or what you do, do all things to the glory of God.
046	1CO	010	032	Be ye without offence, both to Jews, and to Greeks, and to the church of God:
046	1CO	010	033	as I also please all in all things, seeking not my own profit, but that of the many, that they may be saved.
046	1CO	011	001	Be ye imitators of me, as I also am of Christ.
046	1CO	011	002	But I praise you because you remember me in all things, and hold fast the commandments, as I delivered them unto you.
046	1CO	011	003	But I wish you to know, that Christ is the head of every man; and the man is the head of the woman, and God is the head of Christ.
046	1CO	011	004	Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonors his head.
046	1CO	011	005	But every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered dishonors her head: for that is one and the same to her being shaven.
046	1CO	011	006	If a woman is not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it is a disgrace for a woman to be shorn or shaven; let her be covered.
046	1CO	011	007	For a man ought not to cover his head, being the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of the man.
046	1CO	011	008	For the man is not from the woman; but the woman is from the man;
046	1CO	011	009	for man indeed was not created on account of the woman; but the woman on account of the man.
046	1CO	011	010	Therefore the woman ought to have authority on her head, on account of the angels.
046	1CO	011	011	Moreover neither is the woman without the man in the Lord, nor the man without the woman.
046	1CO	011	012	For as the woman is from the man, so the man also is by the woman; and all things from God.
046	1CO	011	013	Judge ye among yourselves: is it becoming for a woman to pray to God uncovered?
046	1CO	011	014	Does not nature itself teach you, that, if a man may indeed have long hair, it is a dishonor to him?
046	1CO	011	015	But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory unto her: because the hair has been given to her for a covering.
046	1CO	011	016	If any one seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor do the churches of God.
046	1CO	011	017	And proclaiming this, I do not praise you, because you come together not for the better but for the worse.
046	1CO	011	018	For in the first place, indeed you coming together, I hear that there are schisms among you; and I in part believe it.
046	1CO	011	019	For it behooves that heresies should indeed be among you, in order that the approved may be made manifest among you.
046	1CO	011	020	Therefore you coming together, it is not to eat the Lord's supper:
046	1CO	011	021	for each one takes his own supper in eating; and one is hungry, and another is drunken.
046	1CO	011	022	For have you not houses in which to eat and to drink? or do you cast contempt on the church of God, and shame those not having? What do I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? I do not praise you.
046	1CO	011	023	For I received this from the Lord, which I have also delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the night in which he was betrayed, took bread,
046	1CO	011	024	and having given thanks, broke it, and said; This is my body, which is for you: do this in remembrance of me.
046	1CO	011	025	Likewise also the cup, after supper, saying; This cup is the new covenant in my blood: do this, as often as you may drink it, in remembrance of me.
046	1CO	011	026	For as often as you may eat this bread, and drink the cup, you do proclaim the death of the Lord, until he may come.
046	1CO	011	027	So whosoever may eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.
046	1CO	011	028	But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup;
046	1CO	011	029	for the one eating and drinking, net discerning the body, eats and drinks condemnation to himself.
046	1CO	011	030	Therefore many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep.
046	1CO	011	031	But if we judged ourselves, we would not be judged:
046	1CO	011	032	But being judged, by the Lord we are chastised, in order that we may not be condemned along with the world.
046	1CO	011	033	So, my brethren, coming together to eat, wait for one another.
046	1CO	011	034	If one is hungry let him eat at home; in order that you may not come together unto condemnation. But I will set in order the remaining things when I may come.
046	1CO	012	001	But concerning the spiritual gifts, brethren, I do not wish you to be ignorant.
046	1CO	012	002	You know that when you were heathens, you were following after dumb idols, as you were led.
046	1CO	012	003	Therefore I make known to you, that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, Jesus is anathema; and no one is able to say; Jesus is Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.
046	1CO	012	004	But there are diversities of gifts, and the same Spirit;
046	1CO	012	005	and there are diversities of ministries, and the same Lord.
046	1CO	012	006	And there are diversities of operations, and the same God, working all things in all.
046	1CO	012	007	But to each one the manifestation of the Spirit has been given unto profit.
046	1CO	012	008	For indeed to one the word of wisdom has been given by the Spirit; and to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;
046	1CO	012	009	to another faith by the same Spirit; to another gifts of healings by the one Spirit;
046	1CO	012	010	and to another the workings of dynamites; and to another prophecy, and to another discernment of spirits; and to another kinds of tongues, and to another interpretation of tongues:
046	1CO	012	011	and one and the same Spirit works all these in you, dispensing unto each one severally as he willeth.
046	1CO	012	012	For indeed there is one body, and it has many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ.
046	1CO	012	013	For indeed we have by one Spirit been baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, or bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit.
046	1CO	012	014	For truly the body is not one member, but many.
046	1CO	012	015	If the foot may say; Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; it is not on account of this not of the body.
046	1CO	012	016	And if the ear may say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body, it is not on account of this not of the body.
046	1CO	012	017	If the eye were the whole body, where is the hearing? If the hearing where the whole body, where is the smelling?
046	1CO	012	018	But now God has placed the members each one of them in the body, as he wished.
046	1CO	012	019	And if all were one member, where is the body?
046	1CO	012	020	But now indeed the members are many, but the body is one.
046	1CO	012	021	But the eye is not able to say to the hand, I have no need of you: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you:
046	1CO	012	022	but much more are the members of the body which seem to be the weaker necessary:
046	1CO	012	023	and those which we regard the more dishonorable members of the body, upon these we confer the more abundant honors; and our uncomely members have the more abundant comeliness;
046	1CO	012	024	but our comely members have no need. But God has adjusted the body, having given the more abundant honor to that part which lacked;
046	1CO	012	025	in order that there may be no schisms in the body, but the members may care the same for one another.
046	1CO	012	026	And if one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; if one member is glorified, all the members rejoice with it.
046	1CO	012	027	But you are the body of Christ and members one of another.
046	1CO	012	028	Whom God has, indeed, also placed in the church, first apostles, then prophets, then teachers, then dynamites, then gifts of healings, helps, leaderships, kinds of tongues.
046	1CO	012	029	Whether are all apostles? whether are all prophets? whether are all teachers? whether are all dynamites?
046	1CO	012	030	whether do all have the gifts of healings? whether do all speak with tongues? whether do all interpret?
046	1CO	012	031	Seek earnestly these greater gifts; and yet I show unto you a more excellent way.
046	1CO	013	001	If I may speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not divine love, I have become a sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.
046	1CO	013	002	And if I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, and have not divine love, I am nothing.
046	1CO	013	003	And if I give all my goods to feed the poor, and if I may give my body that I shall be burnt, and have not divine love, I am profited as to nothing.
046	1CO	013	004	Divine love suffers long; divine love is kind; divine love envies not; does not make a display of itself, is not puffed up,
046	1CO	013	005	does not behave itself uncomely, seeks not its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil;
046	1CO	013	006	it does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but it rejoices in the truth;
046	1CO	013	007	it bears all things, it believes all things, it hopes all things, it endures all things.
046	1CO	013	008	Divine love never falls: but whether there are prophecies, they shall be done away; whether there are tongues, they shall cease; whether there is knowledge, it shall vanish away.
046	1CO	013	009	For we know in part, and prophesy in part:
046	1CO	013	010	but when the perfect may come, that which is in part shall be done away.
046	1CO	013	011	When I was an infant, I talked like an infant, I thought like an infant, I reasoned like an infant: when I became a man, I put away the things of the infant.
046	1CO	013	012	For we now see through a mirror in an enigma; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know perfectly even as I am perfectly known.
046	1CO	013	013	But now abide faith, hope, divine love, these three; but the greatest of these is divine love.
046	1CO	014	001	Follow after divine love; and seek the spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy.
046	1CO	014	002	For the one speaking with a tongue speaks not to men, but to God; for no one hears him; but he speaks mysteries in the spirit:
046	1CO	014	003	but the one prophesying speaks to men edification, exhortation, and comfort.
046	1CO	014	004	The one speaking with a tongue edifies himself; but the one prophesying edifies the church.
046	1CO	014	005	But I wish you all to speak with tongues, but rather that you may prophesy: but greater is the one prophesying, than the one speaking with tongues, unless he may interpret, in order that the church may receive edification.
046	1CO	014	006	But now, brethren, if I may come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I shall speak to you either in revelation, or knowledge, or prophecy, or in instruction?
046	1CO	014	007	Nevertheless things without life, giving forth a voice, whether pipe or harp, if it may not give a distinction to the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped, or what is harped?
046	1CO	014	008	For if indeed the trumpet may give an uncertain sound, who will prepare himself for the war?
046	1CO	014	009	Thus also if you through the tongue may give an indistinct word, how will that which is spoken be known? for you will be speaking into the air.
046	1CO	014	010	If it so happens that there are so many kinds of voices in the world, and nothing without a voice;
046	1CO	014	011	if then I do not understand the power of the voice, I will be a barbarian to the one speaking, and the one speaking will be a barbarian to me.
046	1CO	014	012	So also you, since you are zealots of spirits, seek that you may abound unto the edification of the church.
046	1CO	014	013	Therefore let the one speaking with a tongue, pray that one may interpret.
046	1CO	014	014	For if I pray with a tongue, my spirit is praying, but my mind is not fruitful.
046	1CO	014	015	Then what is it? I will pray with my spirit, and I will pray with my mind also: I will sing with my spirit, and I will sing with my mind also.
046	1CO	014	016	Since if you may bless with the spirit, how will one occupying the place of the unlearned say Amen to your blessing? since he does not know what you are saying.
046	1CO	014	017	For you indeed bless beautifully, but the other is not edified.
046	1CO	014	018	I thank God, I speak with tongue more than you all:
046	1CO	014	019	but I would rather speak five words in the church with my understanding, so that I may indeed teach others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.
046	1CO	014	020	Brethren, be not children in intellect: but be infants in evil, but be perfect in intellect.
046	1CO	014	021	It has been written in the law; I will speak to this people with other tongues and with the lips of others; and thus they will not hearken unto me, says the Lord.
046	1CO	014	022	So tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to the unbelievers: and prophecy is not for the unbelievers, but for the believers.
046	1CO	014	023	Then if the whole church may come together, and all may speak with tongues, and the unlearned or unbelievers may come in, will they not say that you are gone mad?
046	1CO	014	024	But if all may prophesy, and some unbeliever or unlearned person may come in, he is convicted by all, he is discerned by all;
046	1CO	014	025	the secrets of his heart are made manifest; and thus falling upon his face he will worship God, proclaiming that God is truly in you.
046	1CO	014	026	Then what is it, brethren? When you may come together, each one has a psalm, has a lesson, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to edification.
046	1CO	014	027	If one speaks with a tongue, let it he by twos, or at most by threes, and separately; and let one interpret;
046	1CO	014	028	but if there may be no interpreter, let him keep silent in the church; but let him speak to himself, and to God.
046	1CO	014	029	But let two or three prophets speak, and let the others give audience;
046	1CO	014	030	but if something may be revealed to another sitting down, let the first be silent.
046	1CO	014	031	For you are all able to prophesy one by one, in order that all may learn, and all may be comforted.
046	1CO	014	032	Truly the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets;
046	1CO	014	033	for he is not a God of confusion, but of peace. So in all the churches of the saints,
046	1CO	014	034	let the women be silent in the churches: for it is not permitted to them to talk; but let them be subordinate, as the law also says.
046	1CO	014	035	But if they wish to learn something, let them ask their own husbands at home: for it is disgraceful for a woman to talk in church.
046	1CO	014	036	Whether did the word of God come out from you? or has it reached unto you alone?
046	1CO	014	037	If any one seems to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him understand the things which I write to you, that they are of the Lord;
046	1CO	014	038	but if any one ignores, he is ignored.
046	1CO	014	039	So, my brethren, be zealous to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak with tongues;
046	1CO	014	040	but let all things be done decently and in order.
046	1CO	015	001	But I make known to you, brethren, the gospel which I preached unto you, which you indeed received, in which you also stand,
046	1CO	015	002	by which you are also saved; which word I preached to you, if you hold it fast, otherwise you believed in vain.
046	1CO	015	003	For I delivered unto you in the first place that which I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
046	1CO	015	004	and that he was buried, and that he arose on the third day according to the Scriptures;
046	1CO	015	005	and that he was seen by Cephas; then by the twelve.
046	1CO	015	006	Then he was seen by more than five hundred brethren at once, of whom the more remain unto this day, but some have fallen asleep.
046	1CO	015	007	Then he was seen by James; then by all the apostles.
046	1CO	015	008	But last of all he was seen by me, as one born out of due time.
046	1CO	015	009	For I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
046	1CO	015	010	But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace was not vain toward me; but I have labored more abundantly than they all: and not I, but the grace of God with me.
046	1CO	015	011	Then whether I or they, so we preach, and so you believed.
046	1CO	015	012	But if Christ is preached that he is risen from the dead, how do certain ones among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?
046	1CO	015	013	but if there is no resurrection of the dead, Christ is not risen:
046	1CO	015	014	but if Christ is not risen, then indeed is our preaching vain, and your faith is vain.
046	1CO	015	015	And we are indeed found false witnesses of God; because we testified according to God that he raised Christ: whom he did not raise, if then the dead rise not.
046	1CO	015	016	But if the dead rise not, neither is Christ risen.
046	1CO	015	017	But if Christ is not risen, your faith is vain; you are yet in your sins.
046	1CO	015	018	Then indeed those having fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
046	1CO	015	019	If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men the most pitiable.
046	1CO	015	020	But now Christ is risen from the dead, the firstfruit of them that slept.
046	1CO	015	021	For since death was through a man, the resurrection of the dead is also through a man.
046	1CO	015	022	For as in Adam all die, so truly in Christ shall all be made alive.
046	1CO	015	023	But each one in his own rank: Christ the first-fruit; then they who are Christ's, at His coming:
046	1CO	015	024	then the end, when he may deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father, when he may destroy all government, all authority and power.
046	1CO	015	025	For it behooves him to reign until he may put all enemies under his feet.
046	1CO	015	026	Death the last enemy is destroyed.
046	1CO	015	027	For, he has subordinated all things beneath his feet. But when he may say, that all things have been subordinated, it is evident that the One having subordinated all things to him is excepted.
046	1CO	015	028	But when he may subordinate all things to him, then the Son himself will also be subordinated to him who hath subordinated all things to Himself, in order that God may be all things in all.
046	1CO	015	029	Then what shall they do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead rise not at all, why are they also baptized for them?
046	1CO	015	030	Why indeed are we in jeopardy every hour?
046	1CO	015	031	I protest by your rejoicing, brethren, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.
046	1CO	015	032	If after the manner of men I have fought with the wild beasts in Ephesus, what profit is it to me? If the dead rise not, let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.
046	1CO	015	033	Be not deceived: Evil communications corrupt good manners.
046	1CO	015	034	Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak to your shame.
046	1CO	015	035	But one will say, How are the dead raised? and with what body do they come?
046	1CO	015	036	Thou foolish one, that which thou sowest, is not quickened unless it may die;
046	1CO	015	037	and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be, but naked grain, if it may happen to be of wheat, or of some one of the other grains;
046	1CO	015	038	but God gives it a body as he wished; and to each of the seeds its own body.
046	1CO	015	039	All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is indeed a flesh of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another flesh of birds, and another of fishes.
046	1CO	015	040	Indeed there are heavenly bodies, and there are earthly bodies: but indeed there is one glory of the heavenlies, and another glory of those upon the earth.
046	1CO	015	041	There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory:
046	1CO	015	042	So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:
046	1CO	015	043	it is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.
046	1CO	015	044	It is sown a psychical body; it is raised a pneumatical body. If there is a psychical body, there is also a pneumatical (body).
046	1CO	015	045	As indeed it has been written; The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last man Adam, a life-creating spirit.
046	1CO	015	046	But that which is spiritual was not first, but that which is animal; afterward that which is spiritual.
046	1CO	015	047	The first man was from the earth, earthy: the second man from heaven.
046	1CO	015	048	As was the earthy, such are they also who are earthy; and as was the heavenly, such are they also who are heavenly.
046	1CO	015	049	And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we must also bear the image of the heavenly.
046	1CO	015	050	But I say this, brethren, that flesh and blood are not able to inherit the kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.
046	1CO	015	051	Behold, I speak to you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,
046	1CO	015	052	in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
046	1CO	015	053	For it behooves this corruptible to put on incorruption, and this mortal to put on immortality.
046	1CO	015	054	But when this corruptible may put on incorruption, and this mortal may put on immorality, then shall the word which has been written be fulfilled, Death is swallowed up in victory.
046	1CO	015	055	O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?
046	1CO	015	056	But the sting of death is sin; and the power of sin is the law.
046	1CO	015	057	But thanks be unto God, who gives us our victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
046	1CO	015	058	So, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.
046	1CO	016	001	But concerning the contribution to the saints, as I commanded the churches of Galatia, so you also do.
046	1CO	016	002	On the first day of the week let each one of you lay by with himself treasuring up, that as to whatsoever he may be prospered, in order that there may be no collections at that time when I may come.
046	1CO	016	003	But when I may be present, whomsoever you may approve by your letters, these will I send to carry away your benefaction to Jerusalem:
046	1CO	016	004	if it may be counted worthy for me also to go, they shall go along with me.
046	1CO	016	005	But I will come to you when I may go through Macedonia; for I do go through Macedonia;
046	1CO	016	006	and perhaps I may abide with you, and even spend the winter with you, in order that you may send me forward whithersoever I may go.
046	1CO	016	007	For I do not wish merely to see you in my journey; for I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord may permit.
046	1CO	016	008	But I shall abide in Ephesus until Pentecost;
046	1CO	016	009	for a door is opened unto me great and effectual, and there are many antagonizing.
046	1CO	016	010	But if Timothy may come, see that he may be with you without fear; for he is doing the work of the Lord, as I also:
046	1CO	016	011	therefore let no one snub him. But send him forth in peace, in order that he may come to me: for I await him with the brethren.
046	1CO	016	012	But concerning brother Apollos, I entreated him much, that he may come to you with the brethren: but it was not altogether his will that he may come now; but he will come when he may have opportunity.
046	1CO	016	013	Watch, stand in the faith, be men, be strong.
046	1CO	016	014	Let all your affairs be in divine love.
046	1CO	016	015	But I exhort you, brethren; (know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruit of Achaia, and they have set themselves to minister unto the saints),
046	1CO	016	016	in order that you may indeed be in subjection unto such, and to every one laboring with you and toiling.
046	1CO	016	017	But I rejoice over the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: because they have supplied your deficiency:
046	1CO	016	018	for they refreshed my spirit and yours. Acknowledge ye therefore them that are such.
046	1CO	016	019	The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Prisca along with the church and their house salute you.
046	1CO	016	020	All the brethren salute you. Salute you one another with a holy kiss.
046	1CO	016	021	The salutation of me Paul with my own hand.
046	1CO	016	022	If any one loves not the Lord as a friend, let him be anathema Maran atha.
046	1CO	016	023	The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you.
046	1CO	016	024	My love with you all in Christ Jesus.

# BOOK	047	2CO	2 Corinthians	2 Corinthians
047	2CO	001	001	Paul, the apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and brother Timothy, to the church of God which is at Corinth, along with all the saints who are in all Achaia:
047	2CO	001	002	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.
047	2CO	001	003	Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of all consolation;
047	2CO	001	004	the one comforting us in all our tribulation, in order that we may be able to comfort those in all tribulation, through the consolation with which we ourselves are comforted of God,
047	2CO	001	005	because as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation through Christ also abounds.
047	2CO	001	006	But if we are troubled it is in behalf of your consolation and salvation; if we are comforted, it is in behalf of your consolation, working in you through the endurance of the same sufferings which we also suffer.
047	2CO	001	007	And our hope is stedfast in your behalf; knowing that, as you are the partakers of the sufferings, so you are also of the consolation.
047	2CO	001	008	For we do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning our affliction taking place in Asia, because we were burthened exceedingly, above our power, so that we despaired even of living:
047	2CO	001	009	but we had the answer of death in ourselves, in order that we might not trust in ourselves, but in God who raised the dead:
047	2CO	001	010	who delivered us from so great a death, and will deliver: in whom he have hope that he will also yet deliver;
047	2CO	001	011	you also cooperating in our behalf in prayer; in order that, the gift which is bestowed upon us from many persons, may through many be a source of thanks given in our behalf.
047	2CO	001	012	For our boasting is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and purity of God, not in carnal wisdom, but in the grace of God, we have sojourned in the world, and especially towards you.
047	2CO	001	013	For we do not write other things to you, but those things which you read and know, and I hope that you will know them perfectly:
047	2CO	001	014	as you have also known us in part, because we are your glorying, as you ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.
047	2CO	001	015	And in this confidence I wished to come unto you sooner, that you may have a second grace;
047	2CO	001	016	and through you to go unto Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and by you to be sent forward into Judea.
047	2CO	001	017	Then wishing this, whether did I use lightness of purpose? or the things which I counsel, do I counsel according to the flesh, in order that it may be with me yes yes and no no?
047	2CO	001	018	But God is faithful, that our word which is to you is not yes and no.
047	2CO	001	019	For Christ Jesus, the Son of God, the one being preached by us, through me and Silvanus and Timothy, was not yes and no, but it was yes in him.
047	2CO	001	020	For so many promises of God, in Him are yes; therefore indeed through him they are Amen unto the glory to God through us.
047	2CO	001	021	But the one confirming us along with you unto Christ, and having anointed us, is God.
047	2CO	001	022	Who also having sealed us, and given us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.
047	2CO	001	023	But I call God to witness to my soul, that sparing you I did not yet come into Corinth:
047	2CO	001	024	not that we domineer over your faith, but we are fellow-workers of your joy: for by faith you stand.
047	2CO	002	001	But I determined this to myself, not again to come unto you in sorrow.
047	2CO	002	002	For if I grieve you, who indeed is the one giving me joy, except the one being grieved by me?
047	2CO	002	003	And I wrote this same thing, in order that, having come, I may not have grief over those from whom it behooves me to rejoice; and having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.
047	2CO	002	004	For out of much tribulation and anguish of heart, I wrote to you through many tears; not in order that you may be grieved, but that you may know the divine love which I have unto you exceedingly.
047	2CO	002	005	But if any one has grieved you all, he has not grieved me, but in part, that I may not burden you excessively.
047	2CO	002	006	This punishment which for many to such a one is sufficient;
047	2CO	002	007	so on the contrary you should rather forgive and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one may be swallowed up with excessive grief.
047	2CO	002	008	Therefore I exhort you to stir up your divine love for him:
047	2CO	002	009	for unto this also I wrote, in order that I may know your approval, if you are obedient in all things.
047	2CO	002	010	But to whom you forgive anything, I do also: for indeed whatsoever I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, it is for your sakes in the face of Christ;
047	2CO	002	011	in order that we may not be gobbled up by Satan: for we are not ignorant of his devices.
047	2CO	002	012	And having come into Troas, for the gospel of Christ, and there being a door opened unto me in the Lord,
047	2CO	002	013	and I had no rest to my spirit, because I did not find my brother Titus: but having bidden them adieu, I came away into Macedonia.
047	2CO	002	014	But thanks be unto God, who always causes us to triumph in Christ, and manifesting the fragrance of his knowledge through us in every place:
047	2CO	002	015	because we are a sweet savour of Christ unto God, among those who are saved, and among those who perish;
047	2CO	002	016	unto the latter a savour from death unto death; but unto the former a savour from life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?
047	2CO	002	017	For we are not as many, corrupting the word of God: but as of purity, but as from God, we speak in Christ, in the presence of God.
047	2CO	003	001	Do we again begin to commend ourselves? or whether have we need of commendatory letters to you or from you, as some do?
047	2CO	003	002	You are our letter, having been written in our hearts, known and read of all men,
047	2CO	003	003	being manifest that you are the letter of Christ, having been ministered by us, having been written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God: not in tables of stone, but in tables that are hearts of flesh.
047	2CO	003	004	But we have such confidence through Christ towards God,
047	2CO	003	005	not that we are able of ourselves to think anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;
047	2CO	003	006	who also rendered us able ministers of the new covenant; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit creates life.
047	2CO	003	007	But if the ministry of death, having been written in letters of stone, was in glory, so that the sons of Israel were not able to look upon the face of Moses on account of the glory of his countenance; which was destined to be done away:
047	2CO	003	008	how will not the ministry of the spirit be more in glory?
047	2CO	003	009	For if there was glory in the ministry of condemnation, how much more does the ministry of righteousness abound in glory.
047	2CO	003	010	For indeed that which was glorious, has ceased to be glorious in this respect on account of the transcendent glory.
047	2CO	003	011	For if that which was to be done away was through glory, much more is that which abides in glory.
047	2CO	003	012	Then having such hope, we use great boldness,
047	2CO	003	013	and not as Moses put the veil on his face, in order that the sons of Israel might not look forward to the end of that which was transitory.
047	2CO	003	014	But their minds were darkened. For until this day the same veil remains in the reading of the old covenant, remains, not lifted; because it is done away in Christ;
047	2CO	003	015	but until this day when Moses is read, the veil lies upon their heart:
047	2CO	003	016	but when they may turn to the Lord, the veil is taken away.
047	2CO	003	017	But the Lord is a Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.
047	2CO	003	018	But we all, with unveiled face beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.
047	2CO	004	001	Therefore having this ministry, as we have obtained mercy, we faint not;
047	2CO	004	002	but we lay aside the hidden things of disgrace, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully, but in the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every conscience of men, before God.
047	2CO	004	003	But if indeed our gospel is hidden, it is hidden with those who are lost:
047	2CO	004	004	in whom the god of this age has blinded the minds of those who believe not, in order that the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, may not shine on them.
047	2CO	004	005	For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.
047	2CO	004	006	Because God is the one, having said; Out of the darkness the light shall shine, which shone in our hearts, to the enlightenment of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.
047	2CO	004	007	But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, in order that the excellency of the power, may be of God, and not of us;
047	2CO	004	008	in everything being troubled, but not in difficulties incorrigible; being at a loss, but not utterly at a loss;
047	2CO	004	009	being persecuted, but not forsaken; being cast down, but not destroyed;
047	2CO	004	010	always bearing about the dying of Jesus in our body, in order that the life of Jesus may also be made manifest in our bodies.
047	2CO	004	011	For we while living are always being delivered up to death for the sake of Jesus, in order that the life of Jesus may be made manifest in our mortal flesh.
047	2CO	004	012	So that death works in us, but life in you.
047	2CO	004	013	But having the same spirit of faith, according to that which has been written, I believed, therefore I also spoke; and we believe, therefore we also speak;
047	2CO	004	014	knowing that the one having raised up the Lord Jesus will also raise us along with Jesus, and present us with you.
047	2CO	004	015	For all things are for your sakes, in order that the grace, overflowing with thanksgiving through many, may abound unto the glory of God.
047	2CO	004	016	Therefore we faint not; but if indeed our external man perishes, yet our internal man is renewed day by day.
047	2CO	004	017	For the light burden of our affliction, which is evanescent, is working out for us an eternal weight of glory according to hyperbole unto hyperbole;
047	2CO	004	018	we not looking at the things which are visible, but the things which are invisible; for the visible things are temporary, but the invisible things are eternal.
047	2CO	005	001	For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle may be taken down, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens.
047	2CO	005	002	For in this we groan, longing to be invested with our house which is from heaven:
047	2CO	005	003	if indeed having been invested, we shall not be found unclothed.
047	2CO	005	004	For indeed being in this tabernacle we groan, being burdened; not that we wish to be divested, but invested, that mortality may be swallowed up of life.
047	2CO	005	005	But the one having wrought us out unto this same thing is God, the one having given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.
047	2CO	005	006	Therefore we are always confident even knowing that, being present in the body, we are absent from the Lord;
047	2CO	005	007	(for we walk by faith, not by sight);
047	2CO	005	008	but we are confident and delighted rather to be absent from the body, and present with the Lord.
047	2CO	005	009	Therefore we are truly ambitious, whether being present or absent, to be well pleasing unto him.
047	2CO	005	010	For it behooves us all to appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, in order that each one may receive according to those things which he has done through the body, whether good or evil.
047	2CO	005	011	Therefore knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade men; but we have been made manifest unto God; and I hope that we have indeed been made manifest in your consciences.
047	2CO	005	012	We are not commending ourselves to you, but giving you occasion of boasting in our behalf, in order that you may have response to those who glory in appearance, and not in heart.
047	2CO	005	013	For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; if we have our right minds, it is for you.
047	2CO	005	014	For the love of Christ constrains us; having judged this, that one died for all; then were all dead;
047	2CO	005	015	and he died for all, in order that those living may not live unto themselves, but unto him who died for them and is risen.
047	2CO	005	016	So that we from now know no man after the flesh: if indeed we have known Christ after the flesh, but we now know him no more.
047	2CO	005	017	So if any one is in Christ, he is a new creature: old things have passed away; behold, they have become new.
047	2CO	005	018	All things are from God, the one having reconciled us unto himself through Christ, and gave us the ministry of reconciliation,
047	2CO	005	019	as that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not imputing their transgressions to them, even having placed in us the word of reconciliation.
047	2CO	005	020	Therefore we are embassadors in behalf of Christ, as God is intreating you through us; we pray you in behalf of Christ, be ye reconciled to God.
047	2CO	005	021	He made him sin in our behalf, who knew no sin; in order that we may become the righteousness of God in him.
047	2CO	006	001	But working together we indeed intreat you not to have received the grace of God in vain:
047	2CO	006	002	(for he says, At a set time I heard you, and in the day of salvation I assisted you; behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation);
047	2CO	006	003	giving no occasion of stumbling in anything, in order that the ministry may not be blamed;
047	2CO	006	004	but in everything commending ourselves, as the ministers of God, in much patience, in tribulations, in straits, in difficulties,
047	2CO	006	005	in stripes, in prisons, in tumults, in labors, in vigils, in fastings;
047	2CO	006	006	by purity, by knowledge, by long suffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,
047	2CO	006	007	by the word of truth, by the power of God; through the arms of righteousness right and left,
047	2CO	006	008	through glory and dishonor, through evil report and good report; as deceivers, and true;
047	2CO	006	009	as being unknown, and perfectly known; as dying, and behold we live; as chastened, and not killed;
047	2CO	006	010	as sorrowing, and always rejoicing; as poor, and making many rich; as having nothing, and possessing all things.
047	2CO	006	011	Our mouth is open unto you, O Corinthians, our heart is enlarged.
047	2CO	006	012	Be not straitened in reference to us, but be straitened in your own affections.
047	2CO	006	013	But as I speak to children, you indeed receive this reward.
047	2CO	006	014	Be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what participation is there to righteousness and unrighteousness? or what fellowship has light unto darkness?
047	2CO	006	015	What concord of Christ unto Belial? or what part has a faithful man with an infidel?
047	2CO	006	016	And what harmony has the temple of God with idols? for we are the temple of the living God; as God said; I will live in them, and walk about among them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
047	2CO	006	017	Therefore come out from the midst of them, and be ye separate, says the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you,
047	2CO	006	018	and I will be to you for a Father, and you shall be unto me for sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.
047	2CO	007	001	Therefore having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all the filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
047	2CO	007	002	Receive us: we have injured no one, we have corrupted no one, we have defrauded no one.
047	2CO	007	003	I do not speak for castigation: for I have said before, that you are in our hearts to die with you and to live with you.
047	2CO	007	004	My boldness to you is great, my rejoicing over you is much: I have been filled with consolation, I superabound with joy in all our tribulation.
047	2CO	007	005	For we having come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but in everything being troubled; fightings without, fears within.
047	2CO	007	006	But God, the one comforting the humble, comforted us by the coming of Titus;
047	2CO	007	007	and not only by his coming, but also by the consolation with which he was comforted by you, proclaiming unto us your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced the more.
047	2CO	007	008	But if I grieved you in the letter, I do not regret it, if indeed I did regret it; for I see that, if that letter indeed grieved you for an hour,
047	2CO	007	009	now I rejoice, not because you grieved, but because you grieved unto repentance: for you grieved toward God, in order that you may receive damage by us in nothing.
047	2CO	007	010	For a godly sorrow works repentance unto salvation not to be regretted; but the sorrow of the world works out death.
047	2CO	007	011	For behold, how great enthusiasm, yes, how great apology, yes, how great clearing up, yes, how great fear, yes, how great longing, yes, how great zeal, yes, how great avenging, this same godly sorrow did work in you! In everything you have established yourselves to be pure in the matter.
047	2CO	007	012	Since then indeed I wrote to you, not on account of the one having done the wrong, nor on account of the one having suffered the wrong, but in order that your zeal, which is in our behalf to you before God, might be made manifest.
047	2CO	007	013	Therefore we have been comforted. But we rejoiced the more exceedingly in our consolation over the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all:
047	2CO	007	014	because if I have gloried with him in anything over you, I wag not made ashamed; but as I spoke all things to you in truth, so our rejoicing over Titus was true.
047	2CO	007	015	And the affections of him, remembering the obedience of you all, how you received him with fear and trembling, are the more abundantly towards you.
047	2CO	007	016	I rejoice because in everything I have confidence in you.
047	2CO	008	001	But, brethren, we make known to you the grace of God which has been given in the churches of Macedonia;
047	2CO	008	002	because in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.
047	2CO	008	003	Because I witness, that according to their ability, and beyond their ability they were anxious,
047	2CO	008	004	with much exhortation praying our favor and the fellowship of the ministry which is to the saints:
047	2CO	008	005	and not as we hoped, but they gave themselves first to the Lord, and to us through the will of God:
047	2CO	008	006	that we should exhort Titus, that as he formerly began it, he may indeed also complete this grace unto you.
047	2CO	008	007	But as in every thing you abound, in faith, and in word, and knowledge, and in all zeal, and in divine love from you in us, that you may also abound in this philanthropy.
047	2CO	008	008	I speak not according to commandment, but through the zeal of others also proving the sincerity of your divine love.
047	2CO	008	009	For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, being rich, for your sakes he became poor, that you through his poverty might be made rich.
047	2CO	008	010	And herein I give my judgement: for this is profitable to you, who not only began to do, but to be anxious, a year ago:
047	2CO	008	011	but now indeed complete the work; in order that as there was a promptitude of willing, there shall also be a completion out of your ability.
047	2CO	008	012	For if there is first a willing mind, it is acceptable according to what one may have, and not according to what he has not.
047	2CO	008	013	For it is not that there may be relief to others, affliction to you, but that it may be according to equality: at this time your abundance may correspond to their deficiency,
047	2CO	008	014	that their abundance may correspond with your deficiency, in order that there may be equality:
047	2CO	008	015	as has been written, He that had much did not super-abound; and he that had little did not lack.
047	2CO	008	016	But thanks be unto God, who gives this same enthusiasm in your behalf in the heart of Titus;
047	2CO	008	017	because he indeed accepted our exhortation; and being the more enthusiastic, came unto you of his own accord.
047	2CO	008	018	But we sent with him the brother, whose praise in the gospel is through all the churches;
047	2CO	008	019	not only so, but having been elected by the churches our traveling companion with this philanthropy, administered by us to the glory of the Lord himself, and your promptitude:
047	2CO	008	020	and avoiding this, lest any one may blame us in this benefaction administered by us:
047	2CO	008	021	for we provide things honest, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also before the people.
047	2CO	008	022	And we sent our brother along with him to them, whom we have tried, being frequently zealous in many things, but now much more zealous, with great confidence towards you.
047	2CO	008	023	Whether in behalf of Titus, my companion and fellow-laborer towards you; or our brethren, the apostles of the churches, the glory of Christ.
047	2CO	008	024	Moreover manifesting the exhibition of your love, and our boasting to them in your behalf, in the face of the churches.
047	2CO	009	001	For indeed concerning the ministry which is to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you.
047	2CO	009	002	For I know your promptitude, of which I am boasting to the Macedonians in your behalf, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal has aroused many.
047	2CO	009	003	But I sent the brethren, in order that our boasting which is in your behalf may not be in vain in this region; in order that, as I was saying, your were ready:
047	2CO	009	004	lest perhaps, if the Macedonians may come with me, and find you unprepared, we may be put to shame, in this confidence, (that we may say not, you).
047	2CO	009	005	Therefore I considered it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they may come to you beforehand, and perfect your preannounced benefaction, that it may be ready, as a benefaction, not as a stingy contribution.
047	2CO	009	006	But it is this, he that soweth sparingly shall also reap sparingly; and he that soweth bountifully shall also reap bountifully.
047	2CO	009	007	As each one has predetermined in his heart; not of reluctance, or of constraint: for God loves the hilarious giver.
047	2CO	009	008	But God is able to make all grace abound unto you; in order that, always having all sufficiency in every thing, you may abound unto every good work: as has been written,
047	2CO	009	009	He has scattered abroad, he has given to the poor; his righteousness abides forever.
047	2CO	009	010	But he that gives seed to the sower, will also give bread to the eater, and multiply your sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness:
047	2CO	009	011	in every thing being enriched in all purity, which works out through us thanksgiving to God.
047	2CO	009	012	Because the ministry of this free-will offering is not only supplying the deficiencies of the saints, but also superabounding through much thanksgiving to God;
047	2CO	009	013	through the approval of this ministry, glorifying God in the submission of your testimony to the gospel of Christ, and the purity of your fellowship unto them and unto all;
047	2CO	009	014	and through their prayer in your behalf, earnestly longing to see you on account of the grace of God superabounding unto you.
047	2CO	009	015	Thanks be unto God for His unspeakable gift.
047	2CO	010	001	But I Paul exhort you through the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who before your face am indeed humble among you, but being absent am bold towards you:
047	2CO	010	002	but I pray, that being present I may not be bold with the confidence with which I consider myself bold towards certain ones who regard us as walking about according to the flesh.
047	2CO	010	003	For walking in the flesh, we do not wage war according to the flesh;
047	2CO	010	004	for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty to God unto the pulling down of strongholds;
047	2CO	010	005	casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;
047	2CO	010	006	and being ready to avenge every disobedience, when your obedience may be complete.
047	2CO	010	007	Do you look at things according to the outward appearance? If any has trusted to himself that he belongs to Christ, let him again consider this in reference to himself, that as he belongs to Christ, so do we also.
047	2CO	010	008	For if I shall in any thing the more abundantly boast concerning our power which the Lord gave us for your edification, and not for your destruction, I will not be ashamed:
047	2CO	010	009	in order that I may not seem as it were to terrify you by my letters.
047	2CO	010	010	Because they say, His letters are indeed weighty and powerful; but the presence of his body is weak, and his speech contemptible.
047	2CO	010	011	Let such a one consider this, that, such as we are in word by our letters while absent, such we really are in work being present.
047	2CO	010	012	For we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with certain ones of those who recommend themselves: but they, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves to themselves, are not wise.
047	2CO	010	013	But we will not boast in things without measure, but according to the measure of the rule which measure God has measured to us, to reach even unto you.
047	2CO	010	014	For not as not reaching unto you do we stretch ourselves, for we have advanced in the gospel of Christ even unto you:
047	2CO	010	015	and not boasting in things without measure, in the labors of others, but having hope of your faith increasing among you, to be magnified according to our rule exceedingly,
047	2CO	010	016	to preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, not to glory according to the rule of others in things made ready.
047	2CO	010	017	But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord;
047	2CO	010	018	for he that commends himself is not approved, but whom the Lord commends.
047	2CO	011	001	I would that you bear with me a little in my folly: yes indeed you do bear with me.
047	2CO	011	002	For I am jealous of you with the jealousy of God: for I espoused you to one husband, to present you a pure virgin to Christ;
047	2CO	011	003	but I fear, lest, as the serpent beguiled Eve by his craftiness, your minds may be corrupted from the simplicity which is in Christ.
047	2CO	011	004	For if indeed one coming preaches another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or you receive another spirit, which you did not receive, or another gospel which you did not receive, well do you bear with him.
047	2CO	011	005	For I consider that I am not inferior to the chief of the apostles.
047	2CO	011	006	If indeed rude in speech, but not in knowledge; but in every thing making manifest unto you in all things.
047	2CO	011	007	Did I commit sin humbling myself that you may be exalted, because I preached unto you the gospel of God gratuitously?
047	2CO	011	008	I robbed other churches, having received support for your ministry, and being present with you and being destitute, I burdened no one;
047	2CO	011	009	for the brethren, having come from Macedonia, supplied my deficiency; and in everything I rendered myself not burdensome to you, and will so render.
047	2CO	011	010	The truth of Christ is in me, that this glorying shall not cease unto me in the regions of Achaia.
047	2CO	011	011	Why? because I do not love you with divine love? God knows.
047	2CO	011	012	But what I am doing, I indeed will do, in order that I may cut off occasion from those wishing occasion, in order that in whatsoever they may glory, they may be found even as we are.
047	2CO	011	013	For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.
047	2CO	011	014	And no wonder; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.
047	2CO	011	015	Then it is no great wonder if his ministers are transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose, end shall be according to their works.
047	2CO	011	016	Again I say, Let no one consider me to be a fool; but if not, receive me as a fool, in order that I may indeed glory some little.
047	2CO	011	017	What I say, I am not saying according to the Lord, but as it were in folly, in this confidence of glorying.
047	2CO	011	018	Since many glory in the flesh, I will glory also.
047	2CO	011	019	For cheerfully do you, being wise, bear with the foolish:
047	2CO	011	020	for you bear with them, if any one enslaves you, if any one devours you, if any one captures you, if any one is exalted against you, if any one smites you in the face.
047	2CO	011	021	I speak according to disparagement, as that we are weak; but in whatsoever any one is bold, (I speak it in folly, ) I am bold also.
047	2CO	011	022	Are they Hebrews? I am also. Are they Israelites? I am also. Are they the seed of Abraham? I am also.
047	2CO	011	023	Are they the ministers of Christ? (I speak as a mad man, ) I am more; in labors more abundantly, in stripes more abundantly, in prisons more frequently, in deaths often;
047	2CO	011	024	from the Jews five times I received forty stripes save one,
047	2CO	011	025	thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice was I shipwrecked, a day and a night I spent in the deep.
047	2CO	011	026	Often in journeys, in perils of rivers, in perils of robbers, in perils from my own race, in perils from the Gentiles, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;
047	2CO	011	027	in labor and in toil, in vigils often, in hunger and in thirst, in fastings often, in cold and in nakedness.
047	2CO	011	028	Besides all these, that which comes upon me daily, the care of all the churches.
047	2CO	011	029	Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I do not burn?
047	2CO	011	030	But if it behooves me to glory, I will glory in those things appertaining to my infirmities.
047	2CO	011	031	The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the one being blessed forever, knows that I lie not.
047	2CO	011	032	In Damascus Areta the governor of the king, guarded the city of the Damascenes, to arrest me:
047	2CO	011	033	and through a window was I let down in a basket by the wall, and escaped his hands.
047	2CO	012	001	It behooves me to glory, indeed it is not profitable, I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.
047	2CO	012	002	I knew a man in Christ, fourteen years ago, whether in the body, I know not; whether out of the body, I know not, such a one having been caught up even to the third heaven.
047	2CO	012	003	And I knew such a man, whether in the body, or out of the body, I know not; God knows,
047	2CO	012	004	that he was caught up to Paradise, and heard unutterable words, which it is impossible for a man to speak.
047	2CO	012	005	Concerning such a one I will glory: but concerning myself I will not glory, except in my infirmities.
047	2CO	012	006	For if I shall wish to glory, I will not be a fool; for I speak the truth: but I fear, lest some one may consider with reference to me above what he sees me, or hears from me.
047	2CO	012	007	And that I may not be exalted by the abundance of revelations, a thorn was given unto me in the flesh, the messenger of Satan that he may buffet me, in order that I may not be exalted.
047	2CO	012	008	Three times I called on the Lord concerning this, that it may depart from me.
047	2CO	012	009	And he said to me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for power is made perfect in weakness. Therefore most delightfully I will glory the more in my infirmities, in order that the power of Christ may abide on me.
047	2CO	012	010	Therefore I delight in infirmities, in insults, in difficulties, in persecutions, and in tight places, for Christ's sake: for when I am without strength, then I am dynamite.
047	2CO	012	011	I have become a fool: you did compel me. For I ought to be commended by you: for I am not inferior to the very chief of the apostles, if indeed I am nothing.
047	2CO	012	012	For indeed the signs of the apostleship are wrought in me in all patience, in miracles and in wonders and in dynamites.
047	2CO	012	013	For what is that in which you are inferior to other churches, except that I did not burden you? forgive me this wrong.
047	2CO	012	014	Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not spare: for I do not seek yours, but you. For the children ought not to lay up treasures for the parents, but the parents for the children,
047	2CO	012	015	But I will most delightfully spend and be spent for your souls. If the more abundantly I love you am I loved the less?
047	2CO	012	016	But let it he so, I did not burden you; but, being crafty, I caught you with guile.
047	2CO	012	017	Which one of those whom I sent unto you, did I fleece you through him?
047	2CO	012	018	I called Titus, and sent the brother along with him: whether did Titus defraud you? did we not walk by the same Spirit? did we not in the same tracks?
047	2CO	012	019	For a long time you were thinking that I am apologizing to you. We speak before God in Christ; but all things, beloved, are for your edification.
047	2CO	012	020	For I fear lest, having come, I may not find you as I wish, and may not be found by you as you wish; lest perhaps strife, jealousy, animosities, selfseekings, calumniations, eavesdroppings, inflations, outfallings, are among you;
047	2CO	012	021	lest, I again having come, my God will humble me before you, and I will mourn over many of those having previously committed sins, and not having repented over the uncleanness and the fornication and debauchery which they have done.
047	2CO	013	001	This the third time I am coming to you: in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall be established.
047	2CO	013	002	I have told you beforehand, and I am speaking to you in advance, as being present the second time, even now absent, that, if I may come to you again, I will not spare those who have previously sinned, and all the rest;
047	2CO	013	003	since you are seeking the approval of Christ, who is speaking in me, who is not weak towards you, bit mighty among you.
047	2CO	013	004	For indeed he was crucified from weakness, but he lives by the power of God: for we indeed are weak in him, but we shall live with him through the power of God unto you.
047	2CO	013	005	Prove your own selves, if you are in the faith; examine yourselves; whether do you not know yourselves, that Christ Jesus is in you? unless indeed you are reprobates.
047	2CO	013	006	But I hope that you shall know that we are not reprobates.
047	2CO	013	007	But we are praying unto God, that he may do you no evil, not in order that we may appear approved, but that you may do that which is good, and we may be as disapproved.
047	2CO	013	008	For we are not able to do any thing against the truth, but for the truth.
047	2CO	013	009	For we rejoice when we may be weak, and you may be strong: we are praying for even this, your perfection.
047	2CO	013	010	Therefore being absent I write these things, in order that being present, I may not use severity, according to the power which the Lord has given me for edification, and not for destruction.
047	2CO	013	011	Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect; be of good comfort; think the same thing, live in peace: and the God of love and peace will be with you.
047	2CO	013	012	Salute one another with a holy kiss.
047	2CO	013	013	All the saints salute you.
047	2CO	013	014	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.

# BOOK	048	GAL	Galatians	Galatians
048	GAL	001	001	Paul, an apostle, not from men, nor through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead,
048	GAL	001	002	and all the brethren who are with me, to the churches of Galatia.
048	GAL	001	003	Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,
048	GAL	001	004	who gave Himself for our sins, in order that he might redeem us from the present evil age, according to the will of God even our Father:
048	GAL	001	005	To whom be glory unto the ages of the ages. Amen.
048	GAL	001	006	I am astonished that you are so quickly removed from him who called you in the grace of Christ into another gospel;
048	GAL	001	007	which is not another: but there are certain ones who are troubling you, and wishing to pervert the gospel of Christ.
048	GAL	001	008	But indeed if we, or an angel from heaven, may preach unto you any other gospel except that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.
048	GAL	001	009	As we have before said, and now again I tell you, If any one preaches to you a gospel except that which you have received, let him be accursed.
048	GAL	001	010	For must I now believe men, or God? whether do I seek to please men? if I were still pleasing men, I would not be the servant of Christ.
048	GAL	001	011	But I make known to you, brethren, the gospel was preached to me, that it is not according to a man;
048	GAL	001	012	for I did not receive it from man, neither was I taught it, but through the revelation of Jesus Christ.
048	GAL	001	013	For you have heard of my life formerly in Judaism, that I was persecuting the church of God exceedingly, and destroying it:
048	GAL	001	014	and I was prominent in Judaism above many comrades in my race, being exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.
048	GAL	001	015	When the one having separated me, from the womb of my mother, and called me through his grace, was pleased
048	GAL	001	016	to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:
048	GAL	001	017	neither did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me; but I went away into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.
048	GAL	001	018	Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Cephas, and remained with him fifteen days;
048	GAL	001	019	but I saw no other of the apostles, except James the brother of the Lord.
048	GAL	001	020	Which things moreover I write unto you, behold, before God, that I lie not.
048	GAL	001	021	Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
048	GAL	001	022	But I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea which are in Christ.
048	GAL	001	023	But they were only hearing that The one persecuting us at one time is now preaching the faith which he was once desolating;
048	GAL	001	024	and they continued to glorify God in me.
048	GAL	002	001	Then after fourteen years, I again went up to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking also Titus with me;
048	GAL	002	002	but I went up according to revelation; and I presented to them the gospel which I am preaching among the Gentiles, but privately to the prominent ones, lest perhaps I am running, or did run, in vain.
048	GAL	002	003	But neither was Titus the one with me, being a Greek, compelled to be circumcised:
048	GAL	002	004	but on account of the false brethren having crept in, who came in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, in order that they shall bring us into bondage:
048	GAL	002	005	to whom I rendered not submission for an hour; in order that the truth of the gospel may abide with you.
048	GAL	002	006	But of those seeming to be something what they were at that time makes no difference to me: God does not receive the face of man: for those seeming to me to be prominent added nothing extra:
048	GAL	002	007	but on the contrary, seeing that I am intrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision, like Peter of the circumcision,
048	GAL	002	008	for the one having wrought with Peter unto the apostleship of the circumcision also wrought with me unto the Gentiles:
048	GAL	002	009	and having known the grace of God which was given unto me, James and Cephas and John, who seem to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcision;
048	GAL	002	010	only that we should remember the poor; which very thing I was also zealous to do.
048	GAL	002	011	And when Cephas came into Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to blame.
048	GAL	002	012	For before certain ones came from James, he was eating along with the Gentiles: but when they came, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision.
048	GAL	002	013	And the rest of the Jews also reciprocated with him; so that even Barnabas was led away by their dissimulation.
048	GAL	002	014	But when I saw that they are not walking uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in the presence of all, If you being a Jew are living like the Gentiles and not like the Jews, how do you compel the Gentiles to judaize?
048	GAL	002	015	We being Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,
048	GAL	002	016	knowing that a man is not justified by works of law, but through the faith of Christ Jesus, and we have believed into Christ Jesus, in order that we may be justified by faith of Christ, and not by works of law, because by works of law no flesh shall be justified.
048	GAL	002	017	But if seeking to be justified in Christ, we may also be found sinners, then is Christ the minister of sin? it could not be so.
048	GAL	002	018	For if I again build the things which I have destroyed, I constitute myself a transgressor.
048	GAL	002	019	For I through law died to law, in, order that I may live unto God.
048	GAL	002	020	I am crucified along with Christ; and I live no longer, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.
048	GAL	002	021	I do not make void the grace of God: for if righteousness was through law, then Christ died gratuitiously.
048	GAL	003	001	O foolish Galatians, who has been bewitching you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was set forth having been crucified?
048	GAL	003	002	I only wish to learn this from you, Did you receive the Spirit by works of law, or by hearing of faith?
048	GAL	003	003	Are you so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are you now made perfect in the flesh?
048	GAL	003	004	Have you suffered so many things in vain? if indeed in vain.
048	GAL	003	005	Then did the one imparting to you the Spirit, and working miracles, among you, do it by works of law, or by hearing of faith?
048	GAL	003	006	As Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.
048	GAL	003	007	Then know that those who are of faith, the same are the sons of Abraham.
048	GAL	003	008	But the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel to Abraham beforehand, That in thee shall all the Gentiles be blessed.
048	GAL	003	009	Therefore those who are of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.
048	GAL	003	010	For so many as are of works of law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one who does not abide in all things which have been written in the book of the law, to do the same.
048	GAL	003	011	But that no one is justified by law in the sight of God, is evident: because, The just shall live by faith:
048	GAL	003	012	though the law is not of faith; but the one having done these things shall live in them.
048	GAL	003	013	Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: because it has been written; Cursed is every one having been hung on the wood:
048	GAL	003	014	in order that the blessing of Abraham in Christ Jesus may come to the Gentiles; in order that we may receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
048	GAL	003	015	Brethren, I speak according to a man, nevertheless no one disannuls, or adds to, the covenant of a man which has been confirmed.
048	GAL	003	016	But the promises were spoken to Abraham and his seed. He does not say, And unto seeds, as of many; but as of one; And thy seed, which is Christ.
048	GAL	003	017	And I say this; The law which was given after four hundred and thirty years, does not disannul the covenant which had been before confirmed of God, so as to make the promise of none effect.
048	GAL	003	018	For if the inheritance were by law, it is no more by promise: but God gave it to Abraham through the promise.
048	GAL	003	019	Then what is the law? It was added on account of the transgressions, until the seed to whom the promise was made should come; being ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.
048	GAL	003	020	A mediator is not of one; but God is one.
048	GAL	003	021	Then was the law against the promises of God? it could not be so. For if the law was given being able to create life, truly justification would have been by law:
048	GAL	003	022	but the scripture has shut up all things unto sin, in order that the promise through faith of Jesus Christ may be given to those who believe.
048	GAL	003	023	But before faith came, we were kept under law, being shut up to the faith about to be revealed.
048	GAL	003	024	Therefore the law became our schoolmaster to lead us to Christ, in order that we may be justified by faith;
048	GAL	003	025	but faith having come, we are no longer under the schoolmaster.
048	GAL	003	026	For you are all the sons of God, through faith, in Christ Jesus;
048	GAL	003	027	for so many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.
048	GAL	003	028	There is no longer Jew nor Greek, nor bond nor free, nor male and female: for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
048	GAL	003	029	But if you belong to Christ then you are the seed of Abraham, heirs according to the promise.
048	GAL	004	001	But I say, so long as the heir is an infant, he differs not from a slave, being lord of all things,
048	GAL	004	002	but he is under nurses and stewards until the adoption of the father.
048	GAL	004	003	So also we, when we were infants, were enslaved under the elements of the world:
048	GAL	004	004	but when the fulness of time came, God sent forth his own Son, having been born of a woman, having been born under law,
048	GAL	004	005	in order that he might redeem those under law, that we might receive the adoption of sonship.
048	GAL	004	006	But because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his own Son into our hearts, crying, Father, Father.
048	GAL	004	007	So you are no longer a servant but a son; and if a son, truly an heir through God.
048	GAL	004	008	But you indeed, not knowing God, at that time served those who by nature are not gods:
048	GAL	004	009	but now having known God, and rather having become known of God, how do you turn again to the weak and beggarly elements which you wish to serve again as formerly?
048	GAL	004	010	Do you keep days, and months, and times and years?
048	GAL	004	011	I fear lest I have labored unto you in vain.
048	GAL	004	012	Be ye as I am, because I am as you are, brethren, I am praying for you.
048	GAL	004	013	You have not injured me: you know that through weakness of the flesh I formerly preached the gospel unto you:
048	GAL	004	014	and you did not despise, nor spit upon, your temptation in my flesh; but you received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus.
048	GAL	004	015	Where then is your happiness? for I testify to you that, if possible, having plucked out your eyes, you would have given them to me.
048	GAL	004	016	Therefore have I become your enemy, telling you the truth?
048	GAL	004	017	They zealously seek you in no good way; but they wish to exclude you, in order that you may zealously seek them.
048	GAL	004	018	It is good always to be zealous in a good thing, and not only in my coming to you.
048	GAL	004	019	My children, for whom I again travail in pain until Christ may be formed in you,
048	GAL	004	020	but I wish to come unto you now, and change my voice; because I am at a loss in reference to you.
048	GAL	004	021	Tell me, you wish to be under law, do you not hear the law?
048	GAL	004	022	For it is written that Abraham had two sons; one by a bond-maid and one by a freewoman.
048	GAL	004	023	But the one indeed of the bond-maid was born according to the flesh, and the one of the freewoman through the promise.
048	GAL	004	024	Which things are allegorized: for these are the two covenants; the one indeed from mount Sinai, generating children into bondage, which is Hagar.
048	GAL	004	025	For this mount Sinai is in Arabia, and corresponds with Jerusalem which now is: for she is in bondage with her children.
048	GAL	004	026	But Jerusalem who is above is free, who is our mother:
048	GAL	004	027	for it is written, Rejoice, thou barren one who does not bring forth; break forth and cry aloud, thou that dost not travail: because many more are the children of the barren than of her having a husband.
048	GAL	004	028	But you, brethren, are the children of Isaac, according to the promise.
048	GAL	004	029	But as the one at that time having been born according to the flesh persecuted the one according to the Spirit, even so it is now.
048	GAL	004	030	But what says the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not inherit with the son of the free.
048	GAL	004	031	Therefore, brethren, we are not the children of the bondwoman, but of the free.
048	GAL	005	001	Christ has set you free with freedom, Therefore stand, and be not again entangled with the yoke of bondage.
048	GAL	005	002	Behold I Paul say unto you, that, if you may be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.
048	GAL	005	003	And again I witness to every man who is circumcised, that he is debtor to do the whole law.
048	GAL	005	004	You have been divorced from Christ, whosoever are justified by law: you have fallen from grace.
048	GAL	005	005	For we through the Spirit do await the hope of righteousness through faith.
048	GAL	005	006	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision or uncircumcision avails anything; but faith working through divine love.
048	GAL	005	007	You were running well; who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth?
048	GAL	005	008	The persuasion is not of the one calling you.
048	GAL	005	009	A little leaven leavens the whole lump.
048	GAL	005	010	I have confidence in reference to you in the Lord, that you shall be none otherwise minded: but the one troubling you shall bear the judgment, whosoever he may be.
048	GAL	005	011	But I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I still suffer persecution? then the offence of the cross would be done away.
048	GAL	005	012	I would that those troubling you shall indeed cut themselves off.
048	GAL	005	013	For you were called unto liberty, brethren; only use not the liberty unto an occasion to the flesh, but through divine love serve one another.
048	GAL	005	014	For the whole law has been fulfilled in one word, in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbor with divine love as thyself.
048	GAL	005	015	But if you bite and devour one another, take heed that you may not be consumed one of another.
048	GAL	005	016	And I say, Walk about in the Spirit, and do not perfect the lust of carnality.
048	GAL	005	017	For carnality wars against the Spirit, and the Spirit against carnality; for these are antagonistical to one another; so that you may not do the things which you may wish.
048	GAL	005	018	But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under law.
048	GAL	005	019	But the works of carnality are manifest, which are fornication, uncleanness, debauchery,
048	GAL	005	020	idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, animosities, selfseekings, divisions, heresies,
048	GAL	005	021	envyings, drunkenness, revellings, and things like unto these: which I tell you beforehand, as I did previously say to you, that those doing such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
048	GAL	005	022	But the fruit of the Spirit is divine love, joy, peace, long suffering, kindness, goodness, faith,
048	GAL	005	023	meekness, holiness; against such things there is no law.
048	GAL	005	024	But those belonging to Christ Jesus have crucified carnality with the passions and lusts.
048	GAL	005	025	If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.
048	GAL	005	026	Let us not be fond of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.
048	GAL	006	001	Brethren, if indeed a man may be overtaken in some transgression, you who are spiritual, perfect such an one in the spirit of meekness; watching yourself, lest you may also be tempted.
048	GAL	006	002	Bear the burdens of one another, and so fulfill the law of Christ.
048	GAL	006	003	For if any one seems to be something, being nothing, he deceives himself.
048	GAL	006	004	But let each one prove his own work, and then he shall have rejoicing to himself alone, and not to another;
048	GAL	006	005	for each one shall bear his own responsibility.
048	GAL	006	006	But let the one who is taught the word communicate to the one teaching in all good things.
048	GAL	006	007	Be not deceived; God is not mocked. For whatsoever a man may sow, that shall he also reap:
048	GAL	006	008	because the one sowing to his own flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but the one sowing to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap eternal life.
048	GAL	006	009	But let us not get weary doing that which is good: for in due time we will reap, fainting not.
048	GAL	006	010	Then therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all, especially to those who are of the household of faith.
048	GAL	006	011	You see with how large letters I have written unto you with my own hand.
048	GAL	006	012	So many as wish to make a fair show in the flesh, these compel you to be circumcised; only that they do not suffer persecution on account of the cross of Christ.
048	GAL	006	013	For neither do those who are circumcised keep the law; but they wish you to be circumcised, in order that they may glory in your flesh.
048	GAL	006	014	But it would be impossible for me to glory, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world:
048	GAL	006	015	for neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.
048	GAL	006	016	And so many as shall walk by this rule, peace and mercy be unto them, and unto the Israel of God.
048	GAL	006	017	Finally let no one give me troubles: for I bear in my own body the marks of Jesus.
048	GAL	006	018	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren: Amen.

# BOOK	049	EPH	Ephesians	Ephesians
049	EPH	001	001	Paul, the apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, to the saints who are in Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus.
049	EPH	001	002	Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
049	EPH	001	003	Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the one having blessed us with all spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ:
049	EPH	001	004	as he elected us in himself before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless in his presence.
049	EPH	001	005	in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of sons unto himself through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of his will,
049	EPH	001	006	unto the praise of the glory of his grace, with which he has blessed us in the Beloved:
049	EPH	001	007	in whom we have redemption through his blood, the remission of transgressions, according to the riches of his grace,
049	EPH	001	008	which he has abounded unto us in all wisdom and understanding,
049	EPH	001	009	having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his own good pleasure, which he purposed in himself
049	EPH	001	010	in the economy of the fulness of the times, to rehead all things in Christ, those in the heavens, and those upon the earth; in him,
049	EPH	001	011	in whom we were also chosen by lot, having been predestinated according to the purpose of him who works all things within us according to the counsel of his own will;
049	EPH	001	012	that we should be unto the praise of his glory, who first exercised hope in Christ:
049	EPH	001	013	in whom you also, having heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, in whom, also having believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,
049	EPH	001	014	who is the earnest of our salvation, unto the redemption of the possession, unto the praise of his glory.
049	EPH	001	015	Therefore I also, having heard of the faith among you in the Lord Jesus, and your love which is toward all the saints,
049	EPH	001	016	I do not cease giving thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers;
049	EPH	001	017	in order that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of the glory, may grant unto you the spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the perfect knowledge of himself;
049	EPH	001	018	the eyes of your heart having been enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of his calling, what the riches of the glory of his inheritance among the saints,
049	EPH	001	019	and what the excellent majesty of his power toward us who believe, according to the working of the power of his might
049	EPH	001	020	which he has wrought in Christ, raising him from the dead, and seating him on his right hand in the heavenlies,
049	EPH	001	021	above all government, and authority, and power, and lordship, and every name named, not only in this age, but in the age to come:
049	EPH	001	022	and has subordinated all things beneath his feet, and given him to be head over all things to the church,
049	EPH	001	023	which is his body, the fulness of him who fills all things in all.
049	EPH	002	001	You, who were dead in trespasses and in your sins,
049	EPH	002	002	in which at one time you walked about according to the age of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit which is now working in the sons of disobedience;
049	EPH	002	003	among whom we all indeed at one time lived in the lusts of our flesh, doing the will of the flesh and of the thoughts, and we were by nature the children of wrath, like the rest also:
049	EPH	002	004	but God, being rich in mercy, on account of his great love with which he loved us,
049	EPH	002	005	created life in us in Christ, who were dead in trespasses, by grace you have been saved,
049	EPH	002	006	and he has raised you up, and caused you to sit in the heavenlies, in Christ Jesus:
049	EPH	002	007	in order that he may show in coming ages the superabounding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
049	EPH	002	008	For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
049	EPH	002	009	not of works, in order that no one may boast:
049	EPH	002	010	for we are his workmanship, having been created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God before prepared that we should walk in them.
049	EPH	002	011	Therefore remember, that when you were Gentiles in the flesh, called Uncircumcision by that which is called Circumcision, made in the flesh with hands;
049	EPH	002	012	because you were at that time without Christ, being alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers of the covenants of the promise, having no hope and being atheists in the world.
049	EPH	002	013	But now you are in Christ Jesus, who being at one time far off have been made nigh by the blood of Christ.
049	EPH	002	014	For he is our peace, the one having made both one, and having broken down the middle wall of partition,
049	EPH	002	015	having destroyed the law of commandments in ordinances, through his flesh, the enmity, in order that He might create the two in himself into one new man, making peace;
049	EPH	002	016	and that he may reconcile both in one body to God through the cross, having slain the enmity on in.
049	EPH	002	017	And having come he preached the gospel of peace to you, who were far away, and peace to them who were nigh:
049	EPH	002	018	because through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father.
049	EPH	002	019	Then therefore you are no longer strangers and sojourners, but fellow-citizens of the saints, and members of the household of God,
049	EPH	002	020	having been built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone,
049	EPH	002	021	in whom the entire edifice, being assimilated, increases into a holy temple in the Lord;
049	EPH	002	022	in whom also you are built together into a habitation of God in the Spirit.
049	EPH	003	001	Therefore I Paul, the prisoner of Christ for the sake of you Gentiles,
049	EPH	003	002	if indeed you have heard the economy of the grace of God which is given to me unto you;
049	EPH	003	003	that according to revelation the mystery was made known to me, as I formerly wrote to you briefly,
049	EPH	003	004	according to which you, reading, are able to know my understanding in the mystery of Christ;
049	EPH	003	005	which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it is now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets through the Spirit;
049	EPH	003	006	that the Gentiles are to be fellow-heirs, and the same body, and partakers of the promise of Christ Jesus through the gospel,
049	EPH	003	007	whose minister I became, according to the gift of the grace of God which was given unto me; according to the working of his power.
049	EPH	003	008	To me, the least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;
049	EPH	003	009	and to shine forth what is the economy of the mystery which has been hidden from the ages in God who created all things;
049	EPH	003	010	in order that the manifold wisdom of God through the church, may now be made known to the governments and authorities in the heavenlies,
049	EPH	003	011	according to the purpose of the ages which he made in Christ Jesus our Lord.
049	EPH	003	012	In whom we have boldness and access with confidence through the faith of him.
049	EPH	003	013	Therefore I ask that you faint not in my tribulations in your behalf, which is your glory.
049	EPH	003	014	For this cause I bow my knees to the Father,
049	EPH	003	015	of whom the whole family in heavens and upon earth is named,
049	EPH	003	016	in order that he may grant unto you, according to the riches of his glory, that you be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;
049	EPH	003	017	that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith;
049	EPH	003	018	being rooted and grounded in divine love, in order that you may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height,
049	EPH	003	019	and to know the divine love of Christ which transcends knowledge, in order that you may be filled with all the fulness of God.
049	EPH	003	020	And to him who is able to do exceedingly above all things which we ask or think, according to the power working in us,
049	EPH	003	021	to him be glory in the church indeed in Christ Jesus unto all the generations of the age of the ages: Amen.
049	EPH	004	001	Therefore I, the prisoner in the Lord, exhort you to walk worthily of the calling with which you are called,
049	EPH	004	002	with all humility and meekness, with long suffering, forbearing one another in divine love;
049	EPH	004	003	endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
049	EPH	004	004	There is one body and one Spirit, as ye indeed are called in one hope of your calling;
049	EPH	004	005	one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
049	EPH	004	006	one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and above you all, and in all.
049	EPH	004	007	And to each one of you grace is given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
049	EPH	004	008	Therefore he says, Having ascended upon high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to the people.
049	EPH	004	009	But what is that which ascended, except that which descended into the lower parts of the earth?
049	EPH	004	010	But the one having descended and the one having ascended above all the heavens, that he might fill all things, is the same.
049	EPH	004	011	And he gave some, apostles; some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;
049	EPH	004	012	unto the perfection of the saints, in the work of the ministry, in the edification of the body of Christ:
049	EPH	004	013	until we may all come into the unity of the faith, and of the perfect knowledge of the Son of God, into a perfect man, into the measure of the likeness of the fulness of Christ:
049	EPH	004	014	in order that we may be no longer infants, tossed by the waves and carried about by every wind of teaching, in the caprice of the people, in their craftiness, pursuant to their method of delusion;
049	EPH	004	015	but speaking the truth in divine love, let its grow up in him in all things, who is the head, Christ;
049	EPH	004	016	from whom the whole body, being assimilated and knitted together through every joint of the supply, according to the working in each several part, makes increase of the body in the edification of itself in divine love.
049	EPH	004	017	Therefore I say this, and witness in the Lord, that you no longer walk about as the Gentiles also walk about in the vanity of their mind,
049	EPH	004	018	being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God through the ignorance being in themselves, on account of the blindness of their heart;
049	EPH	004	019	who being past feeling have given themselves up to debauchery, unto the working of all impurity with greediness.
049	EPH	004	020	But you did not so learn Christ:
049	EPH	004	021	if indeed ye have heard him, and been taught in him, as the truth is in Jesus:
049	EPH	004	022	that with reference to your former life, you are to lay aside the old man, who is corrupt in the lusts of deception;
049	EPH	004	023	and to be renewed in the spirit of your mind,
049	EPH	004	024	and to put on the new man, who has been created in harmony with God in the righteousness and holiness of the truth.
049	EPH	004	025	Therefore, having laid aside lying, speak the truth each one with his neighbors: because we are members of one another.
049	EPH	004	026	Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your provocation:
049	EPH	004	027	neither give place to the devil.
049	EPH	004	028	Let the one stealing steal no more: but rather let him labor, working with his own hands doing that which is good, that he may have to give to the one having need.
049	EPH	004	029	Let no corrupt communication go forth out of your mouth, but if anything is good unto edification of need, in order that he may give grace to those who hear.
049	EPH	004	030	And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed unto the day of redemption.
049	EPH	004	031	Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and blasphemy, depart from you, with all evil.
049	EPH	004	032	But be ye kind toward one another, merciful, forgiving one another, as indeed God in Christ forgave you.
049	EPH	005	001	Therefore be ye imitators of God, as beloved children;
049	EPH	005	002	and walk about in divine love, as Christ also loved you, and gave himself for you, an offering and a sacrifice to God for an odor of sweet savor.
049	EPH	005	003	But all fornication, and uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be named among you, as it becomes saints;
049	EPH	005	004	and indecorum, or foolish talking, or indecent jesting, which is not becoming, but rather the giving of thanks:
049	EPH	005	005	for you are knowing this, that no fornicator, or unclean person, or covetous, who is an idolater, has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
049	EPH	005	006	Let no one deceive you with empty words: for through these the wrath of God comes on the sons of disobedience.
049	EPH	005	007	Therefore be not partakers along with them.
049	EPH	005	008	For at one time ye were darkness, but now ye are light in the Lord: walk about as children of the light,
049	EPH	005	009	(for the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth),
049	EPH	005	010	proving what is acceptable to the Lord;
049	EPH	005	011	and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather indeed convict them.
049	EPH	005	012	For it is disgraceful even to speak of those things which are done by them in concealment:
049	EPH	005	013	but all things being convicted by the light are made manifest; for everything made manifest is light.
049	EPH	005	014	Therefore he says, Awake, thou sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine upon thee.
049	EPH	005	015	Therefore see how you walk about circumspectly, not as unwise, but wise;
049	EPH	005	016	buying in the opportunity, because the days are evil.
049	EPH	005	017	Therefore be not unwise, but understand whatsoever is the will of the Lord.
049	EPH	005	018	Be not drunk with wine, in which there is riot, but be ye filled with the Spirit;
049	EPH	005	019	speaking one to another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord,
049	EPH	005	020	always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father;
049	EPH	005	021	being submissive to one another in the fear of Christ.
049	EPH	005	022	Wives, be submissive to your own husbands, as to the Lord,
049	EPH	005	023	because the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is also the head of the church, being himself the saviour of the body.
049	EPH	005	024	But as the church is submissive to Christ, so also let the wives be to their husbands in everything.
049	EPH	005	025	Husbands, love your wives with divine love, as Christ also loved the church with divine love, and gave himself for her;
049	EPH	005	026	in order that he might sanctify her, having purified her by the washing of water through the word,
049	EPH	005	027	in order that he might present to himself the glorious church, having not spot or wrinkle or any of such things; but that she might be holy and blameless.
049	EPH	005	028	So the husbands ought to love their own wives with divine love as their own bodies. The one loving his own wife is loving himself:
049	EPH	005	029	for no one ever yet hated his own flesh; but he nourishes and cherishes it, as Christ also the church;
049	EPH	005	030	because we are members of his body:
049	EPH	005	031	on account of this a man shall leave his father and mother and cleave unto his wife: and they two shall be one flesh.
049	EPH	005	032	This is a great mystery: but I speak in reference to Christ and the church.
049	EPH	005	033	Moreover you also each one thus love his own wife with divine love as himself; and that the wife also reverence the husband.
049	EPH	006	001	Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.
049	EPH	006	002	Honor your father and mother, which is the first commandment with promise,
049	EPH	006	003	that it may be well with you, and you may live long upon the earth.
049	EPH	006	004	And fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.
049	EPH	006	005	Ye servants, obey those who are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in purity of your heart, as unto Christ;
049	EPH	006	006	not with eyeservice, as menpleasers, but as the servants of Christ doing the will of God from the soul;
049	EPH	006	007	serving with good will as the Lord, and not men:
049	EPH	006	008	knowing that if each one may do good, he will receive this with the Lord, whether bond or free.
049	EPH	006	009	And, ye masters, do the same things to them, forbearing threatening: knowing that their Master and yours is in the heavens, and that there is no respect of persons with him.
049	EPH	006	010	Finally, be filled up with dynamite in the Lord, and in the power of his might.
049	EPH	006	011	Put on the panoply of God, that you may be able to stand against the methods of the devil,
049	EPH	006	012	because there is not to us fighting against blood and flesh, but against the governments, against the authorities, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spirits of wickedness in the heavenlies.
049	EPH	006	013	Therefore take the panoply of God, that you may be able to stand in the evil day, and having done all things, to stand.
049	EPH	006	014	Stand therefore, being girded about as to your loins with truth, and being invested with the breastplate of righteousness,
049	EPH	006	015	and being shod as to your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace;
049	EPH	006	016	in all things taking the shield of faith, with which you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one.
049	EPH	006	017	And receive the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:
049	EPH	006	018	praying with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit in every place, and watching unto this same thing in all perseverance and prayer for all the saints,
049	EPH	006	019	and for me that the word may be given unto me in opening of my mouth, boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel,
049	EPH	006	020	for which I am an ambassador in chain; in order that in it I may preach boldly, as it behooves me to speak.
049	EPH	006	021	But in order that you may also know the things concerning me, how I am doing, Tychicus, my beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make known to you:
049	EPH	006	022	whom I sent to you unto this same thing, in order that you may know the affairs concerning us, and he may comfort your hearts.
049	EPH	006	023	Peace and divine love to the brethren, with faith, from God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.
049	EPH	006	024	Grace be with all who love the Lord Jesus Christ with divine love in purity.

# BOOK	050	PHI	Philippians	Philippians
050	PHI	001	001	Paul and Timothy, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints who are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons.
050	PHI	001	002	Grace and peace unto you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
050	PHI	001	003	I thank my God for every mention of you,
050	PHI	001	004	always in all my prayer with joy making supplication,
050	PHI	001	005	for your fellowship in the gospel from the first clay until now;
050	PHI	001	006	having confidence as to this same thing, that the one having begun a good work in you will perfect it unto the day of Jesus Christ:
050	PHI	001	007	as it is righteous for me to think in behalf of you all, because I have you in my heart, both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, that you are all my fellow-partakers of the grace.
050	PHI	001	008	For God is my witness, how I long after you in the affections of Jesus Christ.
050	PHI	001	009	And I pray this, that your divine love may yet more and more abound in perfect knowledge and all understanding;
050	PHI	001	010	in order that you may distinguish those things which differ; that you may be pure and without offence in the day of Christ;
050	PHI	001	011	being filled with the fruit of righteousness, through Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.
050	PHI	001	012	But I wish you, brethren, to know that the affairs appertaining to me have turned out rather unto the promotion of the gospel.
050	PHI	001	013	So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the pretorian army, and to all the rest;
050	PHI	001	014	and many of the brethren in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are bold to speak the word of God more fluently without fear.
050	PHI	001	015	Some indeed through envy and strife, and some through good will, are preaching Christ:
050	PHI	001	016	the latter from divine love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel:
050	PHI	001	017	the former from self-seeking are proclaiming Christ insincerely, thinking that they will add affliction to my bonds.
050	PHI	001	018	For what is it? moreover that in every place, whether in pretext or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and I rejoice in this, yes, and I will rejoice.
050	PHI	001	019	For I know that this will turn out to me unto salvation, through your prayer and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
050	PHI	001	020	according to my earnest expectation and hope, that I shall be ashamed in nothing, but with all boldness, as always, even now Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death.
050	PHI	001	021	For Christ is my life, and death is my gain.
050	PHI	001	022	But if to live in the flesh, this shall be to me the fruit of the work, indeed I know not what I shall ask.
050	PHI	001	023	But I am in a strait between two, having a desire to depart and to be with Christ; for this is far better:
050	PHI	001	024	but to remain in the flesh is safer on account of you.
050	PHI	001	025	And having confidence in this, I know that I shall abide with you all, unto your promotion and the joy of your faith;
050	PHI	001	026	in order that your rejoicing in Christ Jesus may abound in me through my coming again unto you.
050	PHI	001	027	Only live worthily of the gospel of Christ: in order that, whether coming and seeing you or being absent, I hear those things concerning you, that you are standing in one spirit, with one soul contending for the faith of the gospel;
050	PHI	001	028	and not being intimidated in anything by the adversaries: which is to them the manifestation of destruction, but of your salvation, and this is from God;
050	PHI	001	029	because the blessing is conferred on you in behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but indeed to suffer for him:
050	PHI	001	030	having the same conflict as you saw in me, and now hearing me.
050	PHI	002	001	If then there is any consolation in Christ, if there is any comfort of divine love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and mercies,
050	PHI	002	002	fill my joy, that you may think the same thing, having the same divine love, being like-minded, thinking this one thing;
050	PHI	002	003	that nothing is to be according to self-seeking nor according to vain glory, but in humility esteeming one another better than yourselves;
050	PHI	002	004	looking not each after your own interests, but each after that of others.
050	PHI	002	005	Think the same thing among yourselves, which is also in Christ Jesus:
050	PHI	002	006	who, being in the form of God, thought it not usurpation to be equal with God,
050	PHI	002	007	but he humbled himself, having taken the form of a servant, being in the likeness of men; and having been found in fashion like a man;
050	PHI	002	008	he humbled himself, being obedient even unto death, yea, the death of the cross.
050	PHI	002	009	Therefore God has indeed exalted him, and given him a name above every name;
050	PHI	002	010	that at the name of Jesus every knee must bow, of things in heaven and things upon the earth and things beneath the earth,
050	PHI	002	011	and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, unto the glory of God the Father.
050	PHI	002	012	So, my beloved brethren, as you have always harkened, not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;
050	PHI	002	013	for God is the one working in you both to will and to do, of his own good pleasure.
050	PHI	002	014	Do all things without murmurings and disputatious;
050	PHI	002	015	in order that you may be blameless and pure, the children of God, irreproachable, amid a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world,
050	PHI	002	016	having the word of life; unto my boasting in the day of Christ, because I did not run in vain, neither did I labor in vain.
050	PHI	002	017	But if indeed I am poured out for a sacrifice and an offering for your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice along with you all;
050	PHI	002	018	but you also rejoice in this same thing, and rejoice along with me.
050	PHI	002	019	But I hope in the Lord Jesus, speedily to send unto you Timothy, in order that I may also be delighted, having learned the things concerning you.
050	PHI	002	020	For I have no one like-minded, who will nobly remember the things concerning you;
050	PHI	002	021	for all are seeking after their own, and not the things of Jesus Christ.
050	PHI	002	022	But you know his integrity, that, as a child a father, he served along with me in the gospel.
050	PHI	002	023	Indeed then I hope to send him, so soon as I may learn the things concerning myself:
050	PHI	002	024	but I trust in the Lord that I myself will come speedily.
050	PHI	002	025	But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow-laborer and fellow-soldier, and apostle and the minister of my necessity;
050	PHI	002	026	since he was longing after you all, and grieving, because you heard that he was sick.
050	PHI	002	027	For he was indeed nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not only him, but me also, in order that I may not have sorrow upon sorrow.
050	PHI	002	028	Therefore I the more diligently, in order that, seeing him, you may rejoice again, and I may not be without sorrow.
050	PHI	002	029	Then receive him in the Lord with all joy, and have such in honor:
050	PHI	002	030	because he was nigh unto death on account of the work of Christ, having jeoparded his life, in order that he might fulfill your deficiency of ministry towards me.
050	PHI	003	001	Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you indeed is not burdensome to me, but it is safe to you.
050	PHI	003	002	Beware of dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the counterfeit circumcision.
050	PHI	003	003	For we are the circumcision, who serve the Spirit of God, and boast in Christ Jesus, also having no confidence in the flesh:
050	PHI	003	004	even though also having confidence in the flesh. If any other one seems to have confidence in the flesh, I the more:
050	PHI	003	005	in circumcision the eighth day, of the race of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;
050	PHI	003	006	in reference to zeal, persecuting the church, according to righteousness which was in the law being blameless.
050	PHI	003	007	Those things which were gained to me, these I counted loss for the sake of Christ.
050	PHI	003	008	Yes truly, I even counted all things loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for the sake of whom I suffer the loss of all things, and I consider them but excrements, that I may gain Christ,
050	PHI	003	009	and may be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of law, but that which is through faith of Christ, the righteousness of God through faith:
050	PHI	003	010	to know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;
050	PHI	003	011	if perchance I may attain unto the resurrection which is out from the dead.
050	PHI	003	012	Not that I already received it, or have already been made perfect: but I persevere, if I may receive that for which I have indeed been received by Christ Jesus.
050	PHI	003	013	Brethren, I do not consider that I have yet received it;
050	PHI	003	014	but there is one thing, indeed forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forward to those which are before, I press toward the goal unto the mark of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
050	PHI	003	015	Therefore let us, so many as are perfect, think the same thing: and if you think otherwise in any respect, God will also reveal this to you:
050	PHI	003	016	only, whereunto we have already attained, to walk by the same rule.
050	PHI	003	017	Be ye my imitators, brethren, and mark those thus walking about as you have us an example.
050	PHI	003	018	For many walk about, of whom I frequently spoke to you, and now I speak even weeping, the enemies of the cross of Christ:
050	PHI	003	019	whose end is destruction, whose God is their stomach, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.
050	PHI	003	020	For our citizenship is in the heavens; whence we are indeed looking for our Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:
050	PHI	003	021	who will transform the body of our humility, similitudinous to the body of his own glory, according to the energy by which he is able indeed to subdue all things to himself.
050	PHI	004	001	So, my beloved and longed for brethren, my joy and my crown, stand fast in the Lord, beloved.
050	PHI	004	002	I exhort, Euodia, and I exhort Syntyche, to think the same thing in the Lord.
050	PHI	004	003	Yea, I also entreat thee, noble yoke-fellow, assist those women, whosoever labored with me in the gospel, both along with Clement, and the rest of my fellow-workers, whose names are in the book of life.
050	PHI	004	004	Rejoice in the Lord always: I say to you again, Rejoice.
050	PHI	004	005	Let your clemency be made known to all men; the Lord is nigh.
050	PHI	004	006	Be solicitous about nothing; but in all prayer and supplication, let your request be made known to God.
050	PHI	004	007	And the peace of God, that passes all understanding, will keep your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
050	PHI	004	008	Finally, brethren, so many things as are true, so many things as are noble, so many things as are righteous, so many things as are pure, so many things as are lovely, so many things as are of good report; if there is any virtue, and if there is any praise, think on these things.
050	PHI	004	009	Whatsoever things you have indeed learned and received and heard and seen in me, do the same: and the God of peace will be with you.
050	PHI	004	010	But I greatly rejoice in the Lord, because indeed you have at length revived to think about me; in whatsoever you indeed were thinking, nevertheless you lacked opportunity.
050	PHI	004	011	Not that I speak concerning deficiency: for I have learned to be content with those things amid which I am.
050	PHI	004	012	I indeed know how to be poor, and I know how to abound: in every thing and in all things I learned both to flourish and to be poor, both to abound and to be destitute.
050	PHI	004	013	I can do all things through him who fills me up with dynamite.
050	PHI	004	014	Moreover you did beautifully, communicating with my tribulation.
050	PHI	004	015	And you indeed know, O Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I came out from Macedonia, no church communicated with me in the word of giving and receiving, except you alone;
050	PHI	004	016	because also in Thessalonica both once and twice you sent to my need.
050	PHI	004	017	Not that I seek a gift; but I seek fruit abounding to your credit.
050	PHI	004	018	But I have all things, and I abound: I am full, having received from Epaphroditus those things from you, an odor of a sweet savor, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God.
050	PHI	004	019	But my God will supply all your need according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
050	PHI	004	020	To God even our Father be the glory unto the ages of the ages. Amen.
050	PHI	004	021	Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren who are with me salute you.
050	PHI	004	022	All the saints, and especially those from the house of Caesar, salute you.
050	PHI	004	023	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.

051	COL	001	019	because in him all fulness is pleased to dwell;
051	COL	001	020	and through him, to reconcile all things unto himself, having made peace through the blood of his cross: through him, whether things upon the earth, or things in the heavens.
051	COL	001	021	And you, being at one time aliens and enemies in your minds on account of wicked works, nevertheless he has now reconciled
051	COL	001	022	in the body of his cross through death, to present you holy and blameless and unreprovable before him,
051	COL	001	023	if you abide in the faith, having been grounded and firm, and not moved from the hope of the gospel which you have heard, having been preached in all creation which is under heaven; whose minister I Paul became.
051	COL	001	024	Now I rejoice in sufferings in your behalf, and am filling up the residue of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh in behalf of his body, which is the church;
051	COL	001	025	whose minister I became, according to the economy of God which was given to me unto you, to fulfill the word of God,
051	COL	001	026	the mystery which has been hidden from ages and from the generations: but is now made manifest to his saints,
051	COL	001	027	to whom God willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, who is Christ in you, the hope of glory:
051	COL	001	028	whom we preach, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, in order that we may present every man perfect in Christ;
051	COL	001	029	unto which I also labor, agonizing according to his energy, working in me with power.
051	COL	002	001	For I wish you to know how great a conflict I have in behalf of you, and those in Laodicea, and so many as have not seen my face in the flesh;
051	COL	002	002	in order that their hearts may be comforted, being knitted together in divine love, and in all the riches of the full assurance of understanding, unto the perfect knowledge of the mystery of God, of Christ,
051	COL	002	003	in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
051	COL	002	004	I say this in order that no one may deceive you with a persuasive speech.
051	COL	002	005	For if I am absent in the flesh, but I am present with you in spirit, rejoicing and seeing your order, and the establishment of your faith toward Christ.
051	COL	002	006	Therefore as you received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk about in him,
051	COL	002	007	having been rooted and grounded in him, and confirmed in the faith, as you have been taught, abounding in thanksgiving.
051	COL	002	008	See that no one shall be deceiving you through philosophy and empty delusion, according to the tradition of men, according to the elements of the world, and not according to Christ,
051	COL	002	009	because in him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily,
051	COL	002	010	and you are complete in him, who is the head of all government and authority:
051	COL	002	011	in whom you are also circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of depravity, in the circumcision of Christ;
051	COL	002	012	having been buried with him in baptism, in which you are also raised by the faith of the operation of God, who raised him from the dead:
051	COL	002	013	and you, being dead in trespasses and in the uncircumcision of your depravity, has he created life in you along with himself, having forgiven us all transgressions,
051	COL	002	014	having blotted out the handwriting which was against us in ordinances, which was antagonistical to us: and took it out from the midst, having nailed it to the cross;
051	COL	002	015	having destroyed governments and authorities, he made a public exhibition of them triumphing over them on it.
051	COL	002	016	Therefore let no one judge you in meat, or in drink, or in the participation of a feast, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath:
051	COL	002	017	which things are a shadow of the things to come; but the body is of Christ.
051	COL	002	018	Let no one purposely rob you of your prize by humiliation and worship of the angels, trusting in those things which he has seen, being vainly puffed up by the mind of his depravity,
051	COL	002	019	and not holding the Head, from which the entire body, by joints and ligaments being supplied and knitted together, increases the increase of God.
051	COL	002	020	If along with Christ you are dead from the elements of the world, why are you dogmatized as living in the world,
051	COL	002	021	Touch not, taste not, handle not,
051	COL	002	022	those things which are all unto destruction by use according to the commandments and teachings of the people?
051	COL	002	023	Which indeed are having a word of wisdom in will worship, and humiliation, and austerity of the body; not in any value against the indulgence of the flesh.
051	COL	003	001	If then ye are risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ is, sitting on the right hand of God;
051	COL	003	002	think about those things above, and not things upon the earth.
051	COL	003	003	For ye are dead, and your life is hidden with Christ in God:
051	COL	003	004	when Christ, your life, may appear, then will you also appear with him in glory.
051	COL	003	005	Therefore kill your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry;
051	COL	003	006	through which the wrath of God comes.
051	COL	003	007	In which you indeed at one time did walk about, when you lived in them:
051	COL	003	008	but you also lay aside all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, disgraceful talk out of your mouths:
051	COL	003	009	lie not to one another, having laid aside the old man with his habits,
051	COL	003	010	and having put on the new man, who is renewed into perfect knowledge according to the image of him who created him:
051	COL	003	011	where there is not Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bond, free: but Christ is all things, and in all.
051	COL	003	012	Therefore, as elect of God, holy and beloved, put on affections of mercy, kindness, humility, meekness, longsuffering;
051	COL	003	013	forbearing one another and forgiving one another, if any one may have a quarrel against any one; as Christ also forgave you, so indeed do you likewise:
051	COL	003	014	and in all these things put on divine love, which is the bond of perfection.
051	COL	003	015	And let the peace of Christ reign in your hearts, in which you are called in one body; and be ye thankful.
051	COL	003	016	Let the word of God dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another, in all wisdom, in psalms, hymns, spiritual songs, with grace making melody in your hearts to God;
051	COL	003	017	and every thing whatsoever you may do, in word or in work, do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.
051	COL	003	018	Ye wives, submit to your husbands as is becoming in the Lord.
051	COL	003	019	Ye husbands, love your wives with divine love, and be not harsh towards them.
051	COL	003	020	Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing in the Lord.
051	COL	003	021	Ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath, in order that they may not be discouraged.
051	COL	003	022	Ye servants, obey your masters according to the flesh in all things; not with eye-service, pleasing men, but of purity of heart, fearing the Lord.
051	COL	003	023	Whatsoever you may do, work from your soul, as for the Lord, and not for men;
051	COL	003	024	knowing that you will receive the recompense of the inheritance from the Lord. Serve the Lord Christ;
051	COL	003	025	for the one doing wrong receives that for which he did the injustice: and there is no respect of persons.
051	COL	004	001	Masters, award unto the servants that which is right and equal; knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.
051	COL	004	002	Be constant in prayer, watching in the same with thanksgiving;
051	COL	004	003	at the same time also praying for us, in order that God may open to us the door of the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, on account of which I indeed am bound;
051	COL	004	004	in order that I may manifest the same, as it behooves me to speak.
051	COL	004	005	Walk about in wisdom toward the aliens, buying in the opportunity.
051	COL	004	006	Let your word be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how it behooves you to answer each one.
051	COL	004	007	Tychicus, my beloved brother, and faithful minister and fellow-laborer in the Lord, will make known to you all things which appertain to me:
051	COL	004	008	whom I sent unto you for this same thing, in order that you may know the things concerning us, and he may comfort your hearts;
051	COL	004	009	along with our faithful and beloved brother, Onesimus, who is from you; they will truly make known all things to you.
051	COL	004	010	Aristarchus my fellow-soldier salutes you, and Mark the cousin of Barnabas concerning whom you received commandments; if he may come to you, receive him;
051	COL	004	011	and Jesus, called Justus, who being of the circumcision: these are my only fellow-laborers in the kingdom of God, who have been made a comfort to me.
051	COL	004	012	Epaphras, who is from you, the servant of Jesus Christ, always agonizing in your behalf in his prayers, in order that you may stand perfect even having been fully carried away in all the will of God, salutes you.
051	COL	004	013	For I testify to him, that he always has much solicitude for you, and those who are in Laodicea, and those who are in Hierapolis.
051	COL	004	014	Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas salute you.
051	COL	004	015	Salute the brethren who are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in their house.
051	COL	004	016	And when the letter may be read by you, cause that it may also be read in the church of the Laodiceans; and that you may also read the letter from Laodicea.
051	COL	004	017	And say to Archippus; Take heed to the ministry which you received in the Lord, that you may fill it.
051	COL	004	018	Salutation of me Paul with my own hand. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you.

# BOOK	052	1TH	1 Thessalonians	1 Thessalonians
052	1TH	001	001	Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Grace to you and peace.
052	1TH	001	002	We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention in our prayers;
052	1TH	001	003	incessantly remembering your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope of our Lord Jesus Christ, before God even our Father;
052	1TH	001	004	knowing, brethren beloved of God, your election,
052	1TH	001	005	because our gospel came not unto you in word only, but in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as you know what sort we were among you for your sakes.
052	1TH	001	006	And you became imitators of us, and the Lord, having received the word in much tribulation, with the joy of the Holy Ghost;
052	1TH	001	007	so that you are an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia.
052	1TH	001	008	For from you the word of the Lord echoed out, not only in Macedonia and in Achaia, but in every place your faith which is towards God has gone forth; so that we have no need to say any thing:
052	1TH	001	009	for they proclaim concerning what kind of reception we had unto you; and how you turned to God from the idols, to serve the true and the living God,
052	1TH	001	010	and to await his Son out of the heavens, whom he raised from the dead, Jesus the one delivering us from the wrath to come.
052	1TH	002	001	For you know, brethren, our coming unto you, that it was not in vain:
052	1TH	002	002	but having suffered, and been abused, as you know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God in much conflict.
052	1TH	002	003	For our exhortation was not from delusion, nor from impurity, nor in guile:
052	1TH	002	004	but as we were approved of God that the gospel should be intrusted unto us, so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God who is proving our hearts,
052	1TH	002	005	For at that time we were not in word of flattery, as you know, nor in a pretext of covetousness, God is our witness;
052	1TH	002	006	nor seeking glory from men, nor from you, nor from others, being able to be burdensome, as the apostles of Christ;
052	1TH	002	007	but we were gentle in the midst of you, as if a nurse may cherish her children;
052	1TH	002	008	being so desirous of you, that we are anxious not only to give the gospel of God, but our own souls, because you are beloved unto us.
052	1TH	002	009	For you remember, brethren, our labor and toil: night and day working, that we should burden no one of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.
052	1TH	002	010	You are witnesses, and God, how sacredly and righteously and blamelessly we were unto you who believed:
052	1TH	002	011	as you know, exhorting each one of you, as a father of his own children, and comforting you,
052	1TH	002	012	and testifying, that you walk worthily of God, who calls you into his own kingdom and glory.
052	1TH	002	013	And on account of this we also give thanks to God incessantly, because, receiving the word of God from us by hearing, you received it not as the word of men, but, as it truly is, the word of God, who indeed works in you who believe.
052	1TH	002	014	For ye, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Jesus Christ: because you suffered the same things from your fellow tribes, as they also from the Jews;
052	1TH	002	015	who even killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and persecuted us, and are displeasing to God, and hostile to all men;
052	1TH	002	016	forbidding that we should speak to the Gentiles in order that they may be saved; that they may fill up their sins always: but the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.
052	1TH	002	017	But, brethren, we having been absent from you for the space of an hour, in presence, not in heart, we were the more exceedingly anxious to see your face with much desire.
052	1TH	002	018	Because we wish to come to you, I Paul indeed both once and twice; and Satan hindered me.
052	1TH	002	019	For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing, except you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?
052	1TH	002	020	For you are our glory and joy.
052	1TH	003	001	Therefore no longer containing, we delighted to be left alone at Athens;
052	1TH	003	002	and we sent Timothy, our brother and minister of God in the gospel of Christ, in order to establish you, and exhort you concerning your faith;
052	1TH	003	003	that no one should be shaken in these tribulations. For you know that for this we are appointed.
052	1TH	003	004	For indeed, when we were with you, we foretold you that we are about to suffer tribulation; as indeed took place, and you know it.
052	1TH	003	005	Therefore I indeed, no longer containing, sent that I might know your faith, lest perhaps the tempter tempted you, and our labor may be in vain.
052	1TH	003	006	But Timothy, having already come to us from you, and proclaimed to us the good news of your faith and your divine love, and that you always have a good mention of us, longing to see us, as we do to see you;
052	1TH	003	007	therefore we were comforted, brethren, over you in all our distress and tribulation on account of your faith;
052	1TH	003	008	because we now live, if you stand in the Lord.
052	1TH	003	009	For what thanks are we able to render unto God in your behalf, for all the joy with which we rejoice on account of you before our God;
052	1TH	003	010	night and day praying incessantly that we may see your face, and perfect the deficiencies of your faith?
052	1TH	003	011	But God himself, even our Father, and our Lord Jesus, direct our way unto you:
052	1TH	003	012	and the Lord fill you and cause you to superabound in divine love toward one another, and toward all, even as we also do towards you;
052	1TH	003	013	in order to establish your hearts blameless in holiness in the presence of God even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints: amen.
052	1TH	004	001	Finally therefore, brethren, we pray you and exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that as you received from us how it behooves you to walk about and to please God, as you do indeed walk about, in order that you may abound more and more.
052	1TH	004	002	For you know what promises we gave unto you through our Lord Jesus.
052	1TH	004	003	For this is the will of God, your sanctification, that you abstain from fornication;
052	1TH	004	004	that each one of you know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor,
052	1TH	004	005	not in the passion of lust, as indeed the Gentiles who do not know God;
052	1TH	004	006	that one should overreach and defraud his brother in a business transaction: because the Lord is the avenger concerning these things, as we indeed before told you and witnessed to you.
052	1TH	004	007	For God did not call us to uncleanness, but in sanctification.
052	1TH	004	008	Therefore the one rejecting (sanctification), does not reject man, but God, who indeed gives to you his Holy Spirit.
052	1TH	004	009	But concerning brotherly love you have no need that I write to you: for you yourselves are taught of God to love one another with divine love;
052	1TH	004	010	for you indeed are doing the same thing unto all the brethren in all Macedonia. And we exhort you, brethren, that you abound more and more;
052	1TH	004	011	and that you aspire to be quiet, and to prosecute your own employments, and work with your hands, as we proclaimed unto you;
052	1TH	004	012	in order that you may walk about circumspectly toward the aliens, and you may have need of nothing.
052	1TH	004	013	For we do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those who are asleep; in order that you may not sorrow, even as those having no hope.
052	1TH	004	014	For if we believe that Jesus died and is risen, so also will God bring with him those who sleep in Jesus.
052	1TH	004	015	For we speak this to you in the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left unto the coming of the Lord, can not anticipate those who are asleep,
052	1TH	004	016	because the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first;
052	1TH	004	017	then we who are alive, who are left, will at the same time along with them be caught up in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and so we will be always with the Lord.
052	1TH	004	018	So comfort one another with these words.
052	1TH	005	001	But concerning the times and seasons, brethren, you have no need that I write to you;
052	1TH	005	002	for you yourselves know well, that the day of the Lord is so coming like a thief in the night.
052	1TH	005	003	When they may say, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction comes on them, as travail upon a woman in gestation; and they can not escape.
052	1TH	005	004	But you, brethren, are not in darkness, that the day may overtake you like a thief:
052	1TH	005	005	for you are all the sons of light, and the sons of day: we are not of night, nor of darkness;
052	1TH	005	006	then therefore let us not sleep like the rest, but watch and be sober.
052	1TH	005	007	For those sleeping, sleep in the night; and those who are drunken, get drunk in the night:
052	1TH	005	008	but let us, who are of the day, be sober, having put on the breastplate of faith and divine love; and the helmet, the hope of salvation:
052	1TH	005	009	because God did not put us forth unto wrath, but unto the obtainment of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
052	1TH	005	010	the one having died for us, in order that, whether we are awake or asleep, we shall at the same time live with him.
052	1TH	005	011	Therefore exhort one another, and edify either the other, as you indeed are doing.
052	1TH	005	012	But we intreat you, brethren, to know those who are laboring among you, and standing before you in the Lord, and admonishing you;
052	1TH	005	013	and that you yourselves esteem them exceedingly in divine love for the sake of their work. Live in peace among yourselves.
052	1TH	005	014	And we, exhort you, brethren, admonish the unruly, comfort the small-souled people, support the weak, be longsuffering toward all.
052	1TH	005	015	See that no one may return evil for evil to any one; but always pursue good toward one another, and toward all.
052	1TH	005	016	Rejoice evermore;
052	1TH	005	017	pray without ceasing;
052	1TH	005	018	in every thing give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus towards you.
052	1TH	005	019	Quench not the Spirit;
052	1TH	005	020	despise not prophesying;
052	1TH	005	021	but prove all things; and hold fast to the beautiful;
052	1TH	005	022	abstain from every evil sight.
052	1TH	005	023	And the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly; and may your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless, in the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
052	1TH	005	024	Faithful is the one calling you, who indeed will do it.
052	1TH	005	025	Brethren, pray for us.
052	1TH	005	026	Salute all the brethren with a holy kiss.
052	1TH	005	027	I adjure you in the name of the Lord, that this epistle shall be read to all the brethren.
052	1TH	005	028	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

# BOOK	053	2TH	2 Thessalonians	2 Thessalonians
053	2TH	001	001	Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, unto the Church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
053	2TH	001	002	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.
053	2TH	001	003	We ought always to give thanks to God for you, brethren, as it is worthy, because your faith increases, and the divine love of each one of you all towards one another abounds more and more;
053	2TH	001	004	so that we ourselves rejoice over you in the churches of God, on account of your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations which you endure;
053	2TH	001	005	the manifestation of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you indeed suffer:
053	2TH	001	006	if indeed it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them who are troubling you,
053	2TH	001	007	and to you who are troubled, rest with us, in the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with the angels of his power
053	2TH	001	008	in the fire of flame, dispensing vengeance to those who know not God, and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus:
053	2TH	001	009	who shall suffer vengeance, eternal destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his might,
053	2TH	001	010	when he may come to be glorified among his saints, and among all those who believe, to be wondered at in that day, because our testimony was believed by you.
053	2TH	001	011	Unto which indeed we are praying incessantly for you, in order that our God may count you worthy of the calling, and may fulfill all the good pleasure of his goodness and work of faith, with power;
053	2TH	001	012	in order that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and our Lord Jesus Christ.
053	2TH	002	001	But we beseech you, brethren, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering unto him;
053	2TH	002	002	that you be not suddenly shaken from your mind, nor disturbed, whether by a spirit, or through word, or a letter as by us, as that the day of the Lord has come.
053	2TH	002	003	Let no one deceive you in any way: because unless there may first be an apostasy and the man of lawlessness may be revealed, the son of perdition,
053	2TH	002	004	the one opposing and exalting himself above everything that is called God or divinity; so that he sits in the temple of God, showing himself off that he is God.
053	2TH	002	005	Do you not remember that still being with you, I told you these things?
053	2TH	002	006	And now you know that which hinders, that he should be revealed in his time.
053	2TH	002	007	For already the mystery of lawlessness is working: only there is one now hindering, until he may be taken out of the midst;
053	2TH	002	008	then indeed will the lawless one be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will remove by the spirit of his mouth, and will exterminate by the brightness of his coming;
053	2TH	002	009	whose coming is according to the energy of Satan in all power and signs and wonders of falsehood,
053	2TH	002	010	and in all the deception of unrighteousness to those who perish; because they did not receive the divine love of the truth, that they might be saved.
053	2TH	002	011	And on this account God sends to them the working of delusion, that they should believe a lie:
053	2TH	002	012	in order that they may all be condemned who did not believe the truth, but took pleasure in unrighteousness.
053	2TH	002	013	But we ought to give thanks to God always for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning unto salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth;
053	2TH	002	014	unto which He also called you through our gospel, unto the possession of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
053	2TH	002	015	Then therefore, brethren, stand, and hold fast the traditions which you have been taught, whether by word, or by our epistle:
053	2TH	002	016	and our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, the one having loved us and given eternal consolation and good hope through grace,
053	2TH	002	017	comfort your hearts, and establish you in every good work and word.
053	2TH	003	001	Finally, brethren, pray for us in order that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified, as even unto you:
053	2TH	003	002	and in order that we may be delivered from the ungodly and wicked men; for faith does not belong to all.
053	2TH	003	003	But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you and keep you from the evil one.
053	2TH	003	004	And we have trusted in the Lord in your behalf, that you are doing, and will do whatsoever we command.
053	2TH	003	005	And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and the patience of Christ.
053	2TH	003	006	And we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw from every brother who walks about disorderly, and not according to the teaching they received from us.
053	2TH	003	007	For you yourselves know how it behooves you to imitate us; because we were not disorderly among you;
053	2TH	003	008	neither did we eat bread with any one gratuitously, but with labor and toil, night and day working, that we might not burden any one of you:
053	2TH	003	009	not because we have not the right, but in order that we may give ourselves an example to you, that you may imitate us.
053	2TH	003	010	For indeed when we were with you, we proclaimed this to you, that if any one does not wish to work, let him not eat.
053	2TH	003	011	For we hear that there are certain ones walking about among you disorderly, doing nothing, but they are busybodies:
053	2TH	003	012	but we command such and exhort them in the Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietude working, they must eat their own bread.
053	2TH	003	013	But you, brethren, be not weary doing well.
053	2TH	003	014	But if any one does not obey our word through the epistle, note him; do not keep company with him; in order that he may be ashamed;
053	2TH	003	015	consider him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.
053	2TH	003	016	The Lord of peace himself grant unto you peace always in every way. The Lord be with you all.
053	2TH	003	017	Salutation of me Paul with my own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write.
053	2TH	003	018	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.

# BOOK	054	1TI	1 Timothy	1 Timothy
054	1TI	001	001	Paul, the apostle of Jesus according to the commandment of God our Saviour, and Jesus Christ our hope;
054	1TI	001	002	to Timothy, my beloved son in the faith. Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.
054	1TI	001	003	As I exhorted you to remain in Ephesus, I going into Macedonia, in order that you may command certain ones not to teach heterodoxy,
054	1TI	001	004	nor to give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which present questions, rather than the economy of God which is in faith:
054	1TI	001	005	but the end of the commandment is divine love out of a clean heart and a good conscience and faith free from hypocrisy:
054	1TI	001	006	from which certain ones having deflected have gone out into empty talking,
054	1TI	001	007	wishing to be teachers of the law, not knowing either what they are saying, or concerning what things they do affirm.
054	1TI	001	008	But we know that the law is good, if any one may use it lawfully;
054	1TI	001	009	knowing this, that the law is not made for the righteous, but for the unrighteous and disorderly, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and the profane, for patricides, matricides and homocides,
054	1TI	001	010	for fornicators, for Sodomites, for kidnapers, for liars, for perjurers, and if any thing else is opposed to healthy teaching;
054	1TI	001	011	according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God, with which I am intrusted.
054	1TI	001	012	I give thanks to Jesus Christ our Lord, the one having filled me up with dynamite, because he considered me faithful, having put me in the ministry;
054	1TI	001	013	being antecedently a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and an insulter: but I obtained mercy, because I did it in unbelief being ignorant;
054	1TI	001	014	but the grace of our Lord with faith and the divine love which is in Christ Jesus superabounded.
054	1TI	001	015	It is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief:
054	1TI	001	016	but on this account I obtained mercy, in order that Jesus Christ might in me the chief show forth all longsuffering, for an example of those about to believe on him unto eternal life.
054	1TI	001	017	But to the King of the ages, the incorruptible, invisible, only God, be honor and glory unto the ages of the ages. Amen.
054	1TI	001	018	This charge I commit unto you, O child Timothy, according to the prophecies that went before on you, that you may war a beautiful warfare in the same;
054	1TI	001	019	having faith and a good conscience; which some having cast away have made shipwreck concerning the faith;
054	1TI	001	020	of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have delivered to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.
054	1TI	002	001	Moreover, first of all things, I exhort you, that prayers, supplications, intercessions, thanksgivings, be made in behalf of all men;
054	1TI	002	002	for kings and all who are in authority; in order that we may lead a peaceable and quiet life in all godliness and honesty.
054	1TI	002	003	This is beautiful and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;
054	1TI	002	004	who wishes all men to be saved, and to come to the perfect knowledge of the truth.
054	1TI	002	005	For there is one God, and there is also one mediator of God and men, the man, Christ Jesus,
054	1TI	002	006	the one having given himself a ransom for all, a testimony in due time;
054	1TI	002	007	in which I have been placed a herald and an apostle I speak the truth, I lie not, a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and in truth.
054	1TI	002	008	Therefore I wish that men in every place would all pray, holding up holy hands, without wrath and doubting:
054	1TI	002	009	likewise that the women adorn themselves in comely apparel, with modesty and prudence; not with braided hair, and gold or pearls or costly garments;
054	1TI	002	010	but whatsoever becomes women professing godliness, through good works.
054	1TI	002	011	Let a woman learn in silence in all submission;
054	1TI	002	012	but I do not permit a woman to dictate or usurp authority over her husband, but to be in silence.
054	1TI	002	013	For Adam was first created, then Eve.
054	1TI	002	014	And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression;
054	1TI	002	015	but she shall be saved through child-bearing, if they may abide in faith and in divine love and in sanctification with prudence.
054	1TI	003	001	It is a faithful saying, If any one desires the episcopacy, he covets a beautiful work.
054	1TI	003	002	Therefore it behooves the bishop to be blameless, the husband of one wife, modest, prudent, orderly, hospitable, competent to teach,
054	1TI	003	003	not given to wine, not a controvertist; but gentle, peaceable, not a money lover;
054	1TI	003	004	ruling his own house beautifully; having children in subordination with all gravity;
054	1TI	003	005	but if any one does not know how to rule his own house, how will he take care of the church of God?
054	1TI	003	006	not a novice, lest being puffed up he may fall into the condemnation of the devil.
054	1TI	003	007	But it also behooves him indeed to have a beautiful testimony from the aliens, in order that he may not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
054	1TI	003	008	Likewise let the deacons be grave, not double tongued, not given to much wine, not fond of filthy lucre;
054	1TI	003	009	having the testimony of faith in a pure conscience.
054	1TI	003	010	And let them also first be proven; then let them minister the office of deacon, being irreproachable.
054	1TI	003	011	Likewise let their wives be grave, not tattlers, modest, faithful in all things.
054	1TI	003	012	Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses beautifully.
054	1TI	003	013	For those having ministered the office of a deacon beautifully procure to themselves beautiful progress, and much boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.
054	1TI	003	014	I write these things to you, hoping to come to you more speedily;
054	1TI	003	015	but if I tarry, in order that you may know how it behooves you to deport yourself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.
054	1TI	003	016	And assuredly great is the mystery of godliness; Who is manifested in the flesh, was justified in the spirit, was seen of angels, was preached among the Gentiles, was believed on in the world, was taken up in glory.
054	1TI	004	001	But the Spirit says positively, that in the last times certain ones will depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and to the teachings of demons,
054	1TI	004	002	speaking lies in hypocrisy, having been cauterized as to their own conscience,
054	1TI	004	003	forbidding to marry, commanding to abstain from meats, which God created for reception with thanksgiving to the faithful and to those perfectly knowing the truth.
054	1TI	004	004	Because every creature of God is good, and nothing rejected, being received with thanksgiving:
054	1TI	004	005	for it is sanctified by the word of God and by prayer.
054	1TI	004	006	Submitting these things to the brethren, you will be a beautiful minister of Jesus Christ, being nourished by the words of faith, and the beautiful teaching which you have followed;
054	1TI	004	007	but reject the unsanctified and silly stories: but exercise yourself unto godliness.
054	1TI	004	008	For bodily exercise is profitable unto little; but godliness is profitable unto all things, having the promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.
054	1TI	004	009	This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation.
054	1TI	004	010	For unto this we toil and agonize, because we have hope in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, especially of the faithful.
054	1TI	004	011	Command and teach these things.
054	1TI	004	012	Let no one look with contempt upon your youth; but be you an example of the faithful, in word, in deportment, in divine love, in faith, in purity.
054	1TI	004	013	Until I come, give attention to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.
054	1TI	004	014	Do not neglect the gift which is in you, which was given unto you through prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.
054	1TI	004	015	Be diligent in these things; give yourself wholly unto them; in order that your progress may be manifest to all.
054	1TI	004	016	Take heed to yourself and the teaching: continue in these things; for doing this you will indeed save yourself and those who hear you.
054	1TI	005	001	Rebuke not an elder, but exhort him as a father; the younger men as brothers:
054	1TI	005	002	the elderly women as mothers; the younger women as sisters, in all purity.
054	1TI	005	003	Honor widows who are truly widows.
054	1TI	005	004	But if any widow has children, or grandchildren, let them first learn to show piety to their own house, and to give benefactions to their ancestors: for this is acceptable in the sight of God.
054	1TI	005	005	She who is truly a widow, and left alone, hopes in God, and abides in prayers and supplication night and day;
054	1TI	005	006	but she who is wanton is dead though living.
054	1TI	005	007	Indeed command these things, in order that they may be blameless.
054	1TI	005	008	But if any one provides not for his own, and especially those of his own house, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.
054	1TI	005	009	Let a widow not be taken into account under three score years, the wife of one husband,
054	1TI	005	010	being witness in beautiful works; if she has brought up children, if she has entertained strangers, if she has washed the feet of saints, if she has succored those in tribulation, if she has followed in every good work.
054	1TI	005	011	But reject the younger widows: for when they may wax wanton against Christ, they wish to marry;
054	1TI	005	012	having condemnation, because they have rejected their first faith:
054	1TI	005	013	and at the same time they learn to be idle, going about houses; and not only idle, but also loquacious even busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.
054	1TI	005	014	Therefore I wish the younger women to marry, to raise up children, to rule the house, to give no occasion to the adversary for the sake of reproach;
054	1TI	005	015	for already certain ones have turned away after Satan.
054	1TI	005	016	If any faithful woman has widows, let her support them, and let not the church be burdened; in order that she may give her attention to those who are truly widows.
054	1TI	005	017	Let the elders who stand before the people beautifully, be considered worthy of double remuneration, especially those laboring in the word and teaching.
054	1TI	005	018	For the scripture says, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn: and, The laborer is worthy of his hire.
054	1TI	005	019	Bring not an accusation against an elder, except before two or three witnesses.
054	1TI	005	020	Convict those who sin before all, in order that the rest may also have fear.
054	1TI	005	021	I testify before God, and Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that you must guard these things without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality.
054	1TI	005	022	Lay hands quickly on no one, and be not partaker of other men's sins.
054	1TI	005	023	Keep yourself pure. No longer drink water, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and on account of your frequent sickness.
054	1TI	005	024	The sins of some men are manifest beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they also follow after:
054	1TI	005	025	likewise truly are good works manifested beforehand; and those which are otherwise are not able to be hidden.
054	1TI	006	001	Let the servants so many as are under the yoke, esteem those who are their masters worthy of all honor, in order that the name and doctrine of God may not be blasphemed.
054	1TI	006	002	But let those that have faithful masters not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather let them serve them, because they are the faithful and beloved who are partaking of the benefaction. Command these things and exhort them.
054	1TI	006	003	If any one teaches another doctrine, and does not give heed to the sound words which belonged to our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;
054	1TI	006	004	he has been inflated, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and controversies, from which come envy, strife, blasphemies, evil surmisings,
054	1TI	006	005	wranglings of men having been corrupted as to their mind and turned away from the truth, considering that gain is godliness.
054	1TI	006	006	Godliness with contentment is great gain,
054	1TI	006	007	for because we have brought nothing into the world, we are not able to carry any thing out;
054	1TI	006	008	however having food and raiment we shall be contented with these.
054	1TI	006	009	But those wishing to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown the people in destruction and perdition.
054	1TI	006	010	For the love of money is a root of all evils: which some seeking after have wandered from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.
054	1TI	006	011	But you, O man of God, fly from these things; and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, divine love, patience, meekness.
054	1TI	006	012	Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, into which you have been called, and witnessed a beautiful testimony before many witnesses.
054	1TI	006	013	I charge you before God, who creates life in all things, and Jesus Christ, who witnessed a beautiful testimony before Pontius Pilate,
054	1TI	006	014	that you keep the commandment, spotless and pure, unto the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:
054	1TI	006	015	which the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of the kings, and Lord of the lords, will manifest in his own due times;
054	1TI	006	016	he alone having immortality, inhabiting light unapproachable; whom no one of men has seen, or is able to see: to whom be honor and power eternal. Amen.
054	1TI	006	017	Charge the rich in this world not to think high things, nor to hope in uncertain riches, but in God, who richly supplies us all things for our enjoyment;
054	1TI	006	018	that they do good, be rich in good works, be cheerful givers, ready communicators;
054	1TI	006	019	laying up for themselves a good foundation for the future, that they may lay hold on the life which is life indeed.
054	1TI	006	020	O Timothy, stand guard over that which has been committed to you, avoiding unsanctified, empty talks and oppositions of knowledge falsely so called,
054	1TI	006	021	which some proclaiming have made shipwreck concerning the faith. Grace be with you.

# BOOK	055	2TI	2 Timothy	2 Timothy
055	2TI	001	001	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, according to the commandment of life which is in Christ Jesus,
055	2TI	001	002	to Timothy, my beloved child. Grace, mercy, peace from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.
055	2TI	001	003	I give thanks to God, whom I serve from my ancestors with a clean conscience, as I have incessant mention of you in my prayers, night and day
055	2TI	001	004	longing to see you, remembering your tears, in order that I may be filled with joy;
055	2TI	001	005	having received the remembrance of the unhypocritical faith which is in you; which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice; and, I am persuaded that it is in you also.
055	2TI	001	006	On account of which cause I remind you to revive and refire the gift of God which is in you by the laying on of my hands.
055	2TI	001	007	For God has not given us the spirit of cowardice; but of power and divine love and prudence.
055	2TI	001	008	Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor me his prisoner: but suffer affliction for the sake of the gospel according to the power of God;
055	2TI	001	009	the one having saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the eternal times,
055	2TI	001	010	but now having been made manifest through the appearing of Jesus Christ our Saviour, the one having indeed destroyed death, and lighted up life and immortality through the gospel,
055	2TI	001	011	unto which I have been placed a herald, and an apostle, and teacher:
055	2TI	001	012	on account of which cause I indeed suffer these things: but I am not ashamed; for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to stand guard over that which is committed unto me unto that day.
055	2TI	001	013	Hold fast the form of sound words which you heard with me, in the faith and divine love which is in Christ Jesus:
055	2TI	001	014	stand guard over the beautiful deposit through the Holy Ghost who dwells in us.
055	2TI	001	015	You know this, that all who are in Asia, of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes have turned away from me.
055	2TI	001	016	May the Lord grant mercy to the family of Onesiphorus, because frequently he refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain,
055	2TI	001	017	and, being in Rome, he diligently sought me, and found me.
055	2TI	001	018	May the Lord grant unto him to find mercy with the Lord in that day. And so many things as he ministered in Ephesus, you know better.
055	2TI	002	001	Therefore, my child, be thou filled up with dynamite in the grace which is in Christ Jesus,
055	2TI	002	002	and whatsoever things thou hast heard with me through many witnesses, commit thou the same to faithful men, who will be able also to teach others.
055	2TI	002	003	Suffer affliction, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
055	2TI	002	004	No one operating as a soldier is entangled with the affairs of life; in order that he may please his commander.
055	2TI	002	005	But if indeed any one may fight, he is not crowned unless he may fight lawfully.
055	2TI	002	006	It behooves the toiling farmer first to partake of the fruits.
055	2TI	002	007	Know what I say; for the Lord will give you understanding in all things.
055	2TI	002	008	Remember Jesus Christ, who is risen from the dead, from the seed of David, according to my gospel:
055	2TI	002	009	in whom I suffer affliction as an evil-doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.
055	2TI	002	010	On account of this I endure all things for the sake of the elect, in order that they may also have the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
055	2TI	002	011	It is a faithful saying: For if we die along with him, we will also live with him:
055	2TI	002	012	if we endure, we will truly reign with him: if we shall deny him, he will also deny us:
055	2TI	002	013	if we are unfaithful, he remains faithful; for he is not able to deny himself.
055	2TI	002	014	Remember these things, testifying before God, that they shall not fight with words, profitable unto nothing, for the overturning of those who hear.
055	2TI	002	015	Study to present yourself to God approved, a workman not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.
055	2TI	002	016	But reject the unsanctified empty talks: for they will proceed unto more of ungodliness,
055	2TI	002	017	and their word like gangrene will have eating. Of whom are Hymenaeus and Phyletus;
055	2TI	002	018	who have made shipwreck concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection has already come, and they overturn the faith of some.
055	2TI	002	019	The foundation of God stands solid indeed, having this seal, The Lord knows them that are his: and; Let every one naming the name of the Lord depart from iniquity.
055	2TI	002	020	But in a great house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also wood and stone, the former truly indeed unto honor, but the latter unto dishonor.
055	2TI	002	021	Therefore if any one may cleanse himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honor, having been sanctified, well pleasing to the Lord, having been prepared unto every good work.
055	2TI	002	022	But fly from youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith, divine love, peace, with those who call upon the Lord out of a clean heart.
055	2TI	002	023	But reject foolish and undisciplinary questions, knowing that they gender strife.
055	2TI	002	024	But it does not behoove the servant of the Lord to strive, but to be gentle toward all, competent to teach, enduring evil,
055	2TI	002	025	in meekness correcting the adversaries; if peradventure God may grant unto them repentance into the perfect knowledge of the truth,
055	2TI	002	026	and they may escape from the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him (the Lord's servant) according to his will.
055	2TI	003	001	But know this, that in the last days perilous times shall come.
055	2TI	003	002	For men will be lovers of themselves, moneylovers, arrogant, proud, blasphemous, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy,
055	2TI	003	003	without natural affections, covenant breakers, devilish, intemperate, furious, opposed to good,
055	2TI	003	004	traitors, headstrong, puffed up, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;
055	2TI	003	005	having a form of godliness, but denying the power of the same: and from these turn away.
055	2TI	003	006	For of these are those creeping into houses, and leading captive little, silly women laden with sins, being led by divers lusts,
055	2TI	003	007	always learning, and never able to come into the perfect knowledge of the truth.
055	2TI	003	008	In the manner in which Jannes and Jambres also resisted Moses, so these indeed resist the truth; men who are corrupt as to their mind, reprobate concerning the faith.
055	2TI	003	009	But they shall proceed no further: for their insanity will be manifest to all, as theirs also was.
055	2TI	003	010	Burt you have followed my teaching, leadership, purpose, faith, long suffering, divine love, patience,
055	2TI	003	011	persecutions, sufferings; such as came to me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra; such persecutions as I endured: and the Lord delivered me out of them all.
055	2TI	003	012	But truly all wishing to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.
055	2TI	003	013	But wicked men and seducers will wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.
055	2TI	003	014	But abide thou in those things which thou hast learned and in which thou hast been instructed, knowing from whom thou hast learned;
055	2TI	003	015	and that from an infant thou hast known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
055	2TI	003	016	All scripture is God-breathed and profitable unto teaching, unto conviction, unto correction, unto instruction which is in righteousness:
055	2TI	003	017	in order that the man of God may be perfect, having been thoroughly perfected unto every good work.
055	2TI	004	001	In the presence of God, and Jesus Christ, the one about to judge the living and the dead, I testify to, both his appearing and his kingdom;
055	2TI	004	002	preach the word: be instant in season and out of season; convict, exhort, rebuke, with all longsuffering and teaching.
055	2TI	004	003	For the time will come when they will not endure healthy teaching; but according to their own lusts they will heap to themselves teachers itching as to their hearing;
055	2TI	004	004	and they will indeed turn their hearing from the truth, and be turned unto fables.
055	2TI	004	005	But be thou sober in all things, suffer affliction, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.
055	2TI	004	006	For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.
055	2TI	004	007	I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:
055	2TI	004	008	finally there is a crown of righteousness laid up for me, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give me in that day: not only to me, but to all those who with divine love, do love his appearing.
055	2TI	004	009	Hasten to come to me quickly.
055	2TI	004	010	For Demas has left me, having loved the present age, and is gone into Thessalonica; Crescents into Galatia, Titus into Dalmatia.
055	2TI	004	011	Luke alone is with me. Having taken Mark, bring him with you: for he is useful unto me for the ministry.
055	2TI	004	012	But I sent Tychicus into Ephesus.
055	2TI	004	013	Coming, bring the cloak, which I left in Troas with Carpus, and the books, especially the parchments.
055	2TI	004	014	Alexander the coppersmith showed to me much evil: the Lord will reward him according to his works.
055	2TI	004	015	Whom you also watch for he resisted our words exceedingly.
055	2TI	004	016	In my first defence no one stood by me, but all left me: may it not be charged against them:
055	2TI	004	017	but the Lord stood by me, and impowered me; in order that the preaching through me might be fulfilled, and all the Gentiles hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.
055	2TI	004	018	And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and save me into his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory unto the ages of the ages. Amen.
055	2TI	004	019	Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.
055	2TI	004	020	Erastus remained in Corinth: and I left Trophimus in Miletum sick.
055	2TI	004	021	Hasten to come before winter. Eubulus and Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brothers salute you.
055	2TI	004	022	The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.

# BOOK	056	TIT	Titus	Titus
056	TIT	001	001	Paul, the servant of God, and apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of the elect of God, and the perfect knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,
056	TIT	001	002	in the hope of eternal life, which God who cannot lie, promised before the eternal times,
056	TIT	001	003	and manifested in his own seasons his word by preaching, with which I am intrusted, according to the commandment of God our Saviour;
056	TIT	001	004	to Titus, my beloved son according to the common faith. Grace and peace from God the Father and Jesus Christ our Saviour.
056	TIT	001	005	Therefore I left you in Crete, in order that you may set in order remaining things, and establish elders in every city, as I commanded you;
056	TIT	001	006	if any one is irreproachable, the husband of one wife, having faithful children, not in accusation of riot or incorrigible.
056	TIT	001	007	For it behooves the bishop to be blameless, as the steward of God; not audacious, not irascible, not given to wine, not a controvertist, not fond of filthy lucre;
056	TIT	001	008	but hospitable, loving the good, prudent, righteous, holy, temperate;
056	TIT	001	009	holding that which is according to the teaching of the faithful word, in order that he may be able both to exhort with healthy teaching, and to convict the opposers.
056	TIT	001	010	For many are incorrigible, speaking vain things and egotistical, especially those from the circumcision,
056	TIT	001	011	whose mouths it is necessary to stop; who overturn whole families, teaching those things which it does not behoove, for the sake of disgraceful gain.
056	TIT	001	012	A certain one of them, their own prophet, said, The Cretans are all liars, evil beasts, slow stomachs.
056	TIT	001	013	This testimony is true: on account of which cause convict them sharply, in order that they may be sound in the faith,
056	TIT	001	014	not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men turning away from the truth.
056	TIT	001	015	To the pure all things are pure: but to the corrupted and unbelieving there is nothing pure; yea, their mind and their conscience are polluted.
056	TIT	001	016	They profess to know God, but deny him by their works, being abominable, and unbelieving, and reprobate unto every good work.
056	TIT	002	001	But speak you those things which become healthy teaching.
056	TIT	002	002	That the elderly men be sober, grave, prudent, sound in faith, in divine love, in patience:
056	TIT	002	003	likewise that the elderly women be reverent in demeanor, not tattlers, not given to much wine, teachers of that which is good;
056	TIT	002	004	in order that they instruct the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,
056	TIT	002	005	to be prudent, chaste, domestic, good, submissive to their own husbands, in order that the word of God may not be blasphemed.
056	TIT	002	006	Likewise exhort the young men to be prudent:
056	TIT	002	007	concerning all things exhibiting yourself an example of good works; in teaching; purity, gravity,
056	TIT	002	008	the sound word, irrefutable, in order that the adversary may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say concerning us.
056	TIT	002	009	That servants submit to their own masters, that they be obedient in all things; not speaking back;
056	TIT	002	010	not purloining, but exhibiting all good faith, that they may adorn the teaching of God our Saviour in all things.
056	TIT	002	011	For the grace of God, that brings salvation to all men, has appeared,
056	TIT	002	012	teaching us, that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we must live prudently and righteously and holily in this present age;
056	TIT	002	013	looking for the blessed hope even the appearing of the glory of our great God and our Saviour Christ Jesus;
056	TIT	002	014	who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.
056	TIT	002	015	Speak these things and exhort and convict with all authority; let no one despise thee.
056	TIT	003	001	Remind them to submit to the governments, authorities, to obey the rule over them, to be ready unto every good work,
056	TIT	003	002	to speak evil of no one, that they should be peaceable, gentle, showing all meekness to all men.
056	TIT	003	003	For when we also were without understanding, being disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in sin and envy, hateful, hating one another;
056	TIT	003	004	but when the goodness and philanthropy of God our Saviour appeared,
056	TIT	003	005	not from works which are in righteousness, which we did, but according to his own mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and the renewal of the Holy Ghost,
056	TIT	003	006	whom he poured out on us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour;
056	TIT	003	007	in order that, being justified by his faith, we may be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
056	TIT	003	008	The word is faithful, and I wish you to be established concerning these things, in order that those having believed in God may think to excel in good works. These things are beautiful and useful to the people:
056	TIT	003	009	but reject foolish questions, and genealogies, and strife, and controversies about law; for they are unprofitable and vain.
056	TIT	003	010	Reject a heretical man after the first and second admonition;
056	TIT	003	011	knowing that such an one is turned away, and is sinning, being self-condemned.
056	TIT	003	012	When I shall send Artemas or Tychicus to you, hasten to come to me at Nicopolis: for I have determined to spend the winter there.
056	TIT	003	013	Send on Zenas the lawyer and Apollos speedily, in order that nothing may be lacking to them.
056	TIT	003	014	And let our people indeed learn to excel in good works for necessary uses, in order that they may not be unfruitful.
056	TIT	003	015	All who are with me salute you. Salute those who love us with the love of friendship in the faith. Grace be with you all.

057	PHM	001	001	Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ, and brother Timothy, to Philemon the beloved also our fellow-laborer,
057	PHM	001	002	and to sister Apphia, and Archippus our fellow-soldier, and the church in your house.
057	PHM	001	003	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
057	PHM	001	004	I give thanks to my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,
057	PHM	001	005	hearing about your divine love, and the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and all the saints;
057	PHM	001	006	in order that the fellowship of your faith may be efficient in the perfect knowledge of every good thing which is in you toward Christ.
057	PHM	001	007	For I had much joy and consolation over your divine love, because the affections of the saints have been refreshed by you, O brother.
057	PHM	001	008	Therefore, having much boldness in Christ to command you to that which is appropriate,
057	PHM	001	009	on account of the divine love, I the more exhort you, being such as Paul the aged, and now also the prisoner of Jesus Christ.
057	PHM	001	010	I exhort you concerning my son, whom I begat in my bonds, Onesimus,
057	PHM	001	011	him at one time unprofitable to you, but now profitable both to you and to me: whom I have sent back to you,
057	PHM	001	012	him, that is my own heart.
057	PHM	001	013	Whom I did wish to have with me, in order that he might minister unto me in your stead in the bonds of the gospel:
057	PHM	001	014	but without your consent I did not wish to do anything; in order that your good might not be by constraint, but by the free will:
057	PHM	001	015	for on this account he suddenly departed from you for an hour, that you might have him back forever;
057	PHM	001	016	no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a brother beloved, especially to me, and much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord:
057	PHM	001	017	if then you have me a comrade, receive him as myself.
057	PHM	001	018	If he has wronged you as to anything, or owes you anything, charge this to me.
057	PHM	001	019	I Paul have written with my own hand, I will pay it: not that I may say to you that you even owe yourself to me.
057	PHM	001	020	Yea, brother, let me rejoice over you in the Lord: refresh my heart in Christ.
057	PHM	001	021	Having confidence in your obedience I have written to you, knowing that you will do even more than those things which I say.
057	PHM	001	022	And at the same time also prepare for me a lodging: for I hope that through your prayers I will be consigned unto you.

# BOOK	058	HEB	Hebrews	Hebrews
058	HEB	001	001	On many occasions and in many ways in the olden time, God having spoken to the fathers through the prophets, at the last of these days has spoken to us through his Son,
058	HEB	001	002	whom he put forth the heir of all things, and through whom he created the ages;
058	HEB	001	003	who being the brightness of his glory, and the character of his person, and holding up all things by the word of his power, having made purgation of the sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;
058	HEB	001	004	being so much greater than the angels, that he has inherited a name so much more excellent than they.
058	HEB	001	005	For to which one of the angels at any time did he say, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? and again, I will be unto him a Father, and he shall be unto me a Son?
058	HEB	001	006	And again when he may lead in the first begotten into the world, he says, Indeed let all the angels of God worship him.
058	HEB	001	007	And to the angels he says, he maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire: but to the Son he says,
058	HEB	001	008	Thy throne, O God, is unto the age of the age; and the scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom.
058	HEB	001	009	Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, thy God, has anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy comrades.
058	HEB	001	010	And thou, at the beginning, O Lord, didst lay the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the works of thy hands.
058	HEB	001	011	These shall perish; but thou dost remain: truly all these shall wax old like a garment;
058	HEB	001	012	and thou shalt roll them up like a mantle, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail thee.
058	HEB	001	013	And to which one of the angels has he at any time said, Sit thou on my right hand, until I may make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet?
058	HEB	001	014	Are not all these ministering spirits, having been sent forth unto ministration for the sake of those who are about to inherit salvation?
058	HEB	002	001	Therefore it behooves us the more earnestly to give heed to the things which we have heard, lest at some time we may leak out.
058	HEB	002	002	For if the word having been spoken by angels was stedfast, and every disobedience and transgression received a just recompense of reward;
058	HEB	002	003	how shall we escape, having neglected so great a salvation? which having received the beginning to be spoken by the Lord, was confirmed unto us by those who heard it;
058	HEB	002	004	God at the same time witnessing, by signs and indeed by wonders, and various dynamites, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his will.
058	HEB	002	005	For he did not submit the world to come, concerning which we speak, to angels.
058	HEB	002	006	But somewhere one testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? Or the Son of man, that thou visitest him?
058	HEB	002	007	Thou didst humiliate him somewhat comparatively with the angels; thou didst crown him with glory and honor;
058	HEB	002	008	thou didst subordinate all things beneath his feet. For in subordinating all things beneath him, he left nothing which is not subordinated beneath him.
058	HEB	002	009	But we see Jesus humiliated somewhat in comparison with the angels, having been crowned with glory and honor on account of the suffering of death, in order that by the grace of God he might taste death for every one.
058	HEB	002	010	For it became him, on account of whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in leading many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through suffering.
058	HEB	002	011	For both the one sanctifying and they who are sanctified are all of one: on account of which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,
058	HEB	002	012	saying, I will proclaim thy name to thy brethren, in the midst of the church will sing praises to thee.
058	HEB	002	013	And again, I will put my trust in him: and again; Behold, I and the children which God has given unto me.
058	HEB	002	014	Then since the children have inherited blood and flesh, he likewise also received the same, in order that through death he might set at nought him who has the power of death, that is, the devil;
058	HEB	002	015	and might reconcile them whosoever were subject to bondage all their life through the fear of death.
058	HEB	002	016	For not yet does he take upon himself the nature of angels, but he takes upon himself the seed of Abraham.
058	HEB	002	017	Therefore he ought in all things to be made like unto his brethren, in order that he might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things appertaining to God, to the end that he may atone for the sins of the people.
058	HEB	002	018	For in that he himself suffered being tempted, he is able to succor those who are tempted.
058	HEB	003	001	Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest of our profession;
058	HEB	003	002	being faithful to him who appointed him, as indeed Moses in all his house.
058	HEB	003	003	For he is esteemed worthy of more honor than Moses, inasmuch as the One having built it, has more honor than the house.
058	HEB	003	004	For every house is built by some one; and the one having built all things is God.
058	HEB	003	005	And Moses was indeed faithful in all his house as a servant, unto the testimony of those things which shall be spoken;
058	HEB	003	006	but Christ was as a son, over his own house; whose house we are, if we hold fast the boldness and rejoicing of hope firm unto the end.
058	HEB	003	007	Therefore as the Holy Spirit says, This day if you hear his voice,
058	HEB	003	008	harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness,
058	HEB	003	009	whom our fathers tempted in proving me, and saw my works forty years.
058	HEB	003	010	Therefore I was provoked with this generation, and I said, They do always err in their heart: and they have not known my way,
058	HEB	003	011	as I swore in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.
058	HEB	003	012	See, brethren, lest at some time there shall be in some one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in turning away from the living God:
058	HEB	003	013	but exhort one another each day, while it is called to-day; in order that no one of you may be hardened with the deceitfulness of sin:
058	HEB	003	014	for we have been made partakers of Christ, if indeed we may hold fast the beginning of confidence firm unto the end.
058	HEB	003	015	In that it is said, This day if you hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation:
058	HEB	003	016	for who were those, having heard, who were hardened? yea, were they not all those having come out of Egypt under Moses?
058	HEB	003	017	And with whom was he provoked forty years? was it not with those that sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?
058	HEB	003	018	And to whom did he swear that they should not enter into his rest, but to those who believed not?
058	HEB	003	019	And we see that they were not able to enter in on account of their unbelief.
058	HEB	004	001	Then let us fear, lest at some time, the promise to enter into his rest having been left, some of you may appear to have come short.
058	HEB	004	002	For we truly have had the gospel preached unto us, as they did also: but the word of hearing did not profit them, not being mixed with faith to those hearing.
058	HEB	004	003	For we who have believed, do enter into rest: as he has said, As I swore in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest: the works truly having been from the foundations of the world.
058	HEB	004	004	For he somewhere has spoken thus in reference to the seventh day, And God rested on the seventh day from all his works.
058	HEB	004	005	And in this again he has said, They shall not enter into my rest.
058	HEB	004	006	Then since it remains that some do enter into it, and those formerly having had the gospel preached unto them did not enter in on account of unbelief,
058	HEB	004	007	again he appoints a certain day, saying in David, as has previously been said, This day, after so long a time; If you may hear his voice this day, harden not your hearts.
058	HEB	004	008	For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not speak concerning another day after these things.
058	HEB	004	009	Therefore there is a sabbatism left for the people of God.
058	HEB	004	010	For the one having entered into his rest has ceased from his works, as God did from his own.
058	HEB	004	011	Therefore let us hasten to enter into that rest, lest some one may fall by the same example of unbelief.
058	HEB	004	012	For the word of God is living, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing unto the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and a quick discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
058	HEB	004	013	And no creature is hidden in his presence: but all things are naked and have been laid open to the eyes of him to whom the word is unto us.
058	HEB	004	014	Therefore having a great high priest, having entered into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast the testimony.
058	HEB	004	015	For we have not a high priest who is not able to be touched with our infirmities; but one having been tempted as to all things like unto us, apart from sin.
058	HEB	004	016	Therefore let us draw nigh with confidence to a throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and find grace in every opportune need.
058	HEB	005	001	For every high priest, being received from men, presides over men in the things appertaining to God, in order that he may offer gifts and sacrifices for sins:
058	HEB	005	002	being able to sympathize with the ignorant and erring, since himself is also compassed about with infirmity;
058	HEB	005	003	and on this account he has need, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer sacrifices for sins.
058	HEB	005	004	And no one takes this honor to himself, but the one called of God, as indeed Aaron was.
058	HEB	005	005	Likewise Christ also did not glorify himself to become a high priest, but the one having spoken to him, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee:
058	HEB	005	006	as also he says in another place, Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.
058	HEB	005	007	Who in the days of his flesh, having with strong crying and tears offered up both prayers and supplications unto him who is able to save him from death, and having been heard on account of his piety,
058	HEB	005	008	indeed being a Son, he learned obedience from those things which he suffered;
058	HEB	005	009	and having been made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation to all those who obey him;
058	HEB	005	010	having been ordained of God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.
058	HEB	005	011	Concerning whom there is much word to us, and difficult to speak, since you are dull of hearing.
058	HEB	005	012	For indeed you, who ought to be teachers so far as time is concerned, have need that some one again teach you what are the rudiments of the beginning of the oracles of God; and you have need of milk, not solid food.
058	HEB	005	013	For every one partaking of milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness; for he is a babe;
058	HEB	005	014	but solid food belongs to the perfect, those having their senses disciplined by use unto the discernment both of the good and the evil.
058	HEB	006	001	Therefore having left the word of the beginning of Christ, let us be carried to perfection; not again laying the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,
058	HEB	006	002	of the teaching of baptisms, and of the laying on of hands, and of the resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.
058	HEB	006	003	And we will do this, if God may permit.
058	HEB	006	004	For it is impossible that those having been once enlightened, and tasted the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of the Holy Ghost,
058	HEB	006	005	and having tasted the beautiful word of God, and the dynamites of the coming age,
058	HEB	006	006	indeed having fallen away, to renew them again unto repentance; having crucified to themselves again the Son of God, and put him to an open shame.
058	HEB	006	007	For the earth drinking the rain coming often upon her, and bringing forth the herb nutritious to those by whom it is also cultivated, receives blessings from God:
058	HEB	006	008	but that which produces thorns and thistles, is reprobate, and nigh unto the curse; whose end is unto burning.
058	HEB	006	009	But, beloved, we are persuaded better things concerning you, and things appertaining to salvation, if indeed we do thus speak.
058	HEB	006	010	For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and the divine love which you manifested in his name, having ministered to the saints, and ministering.
058	HEB	006	011	But we desire each one of you to exhibit the same diligence unto the full assurance of hope unto the end:
058	HEB	006	012	in order that you may not be dull, but imitators of those who through faith and longsufferings do inherit the promises.
058	HEB	006	013	For God having promised Abraham, since he had no greater one by whom to swear, swore by himself,
058	HEB	006	014	saying, If indeed blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee:
058	HEB	006	015	and thus having waited long, he received the promise.
058	HEB	006	016	For men swear by the greater: and an oath of confirmation is to them an end to all controversy:
058	HEB	006	017	but God, in this wishing more abundantly to show forth to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath:
058	HEB	006	018	that through two immutable things in which it was impossible that God should lie, we who have fled may have a strong consolation to lay hold of the hope set before us,
058	HEB	006	019	which we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast and entering into that which is in the veil,
058	HEB	006	020	whither Jesus the forerunner has entered in our behalf, having been made a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.
058	HEB	007	001	For this Melchizedek, the king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, the one having met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him,
058	HEB	007	002	to whom Abraham divided the tenth from all first, being interpreted, King of righteousness, and then King of Salem, which is, King of peace;
058	HEB	007	003	without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but being made like unto the Son of God, he abides a priest continually.
058	HEB	007	004	You see how great this man was, to whom the patriarch Abraham even gave the tenth part of the chief spoils.
058	HEB	007	005	And those indeed of the sons of Levi receiving the priesthood have a commandment to tithe the people according to the law, that is, their brethren, even though having come out from the loins of Abraham:
058	HEB	007	006	but he who did not derive his lineage from them has tithed Abraham, and blessed him having the promises.
058	HEB	007	007	For without contradiction the less is blessed by the better.
058	HEB	007	008	And here indeed men dying, receive tithes; however there, he is witnessed to that he lives.
058	HEB	007	009	And, so to speak a word, Levi, the one receiving tithes, has also been tithed through Abraham.
058	HEB	007	010	For he was still in the loins of his father, when Melchizedek met him.
058	HEB	007	011	Then indeed if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood, for unto it the people have been tithed, what need is there still that another priest shall rise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be called after the order of Aaron?
058	HEB	007	012	For the priesthood being changed, of necessity there is a change of the law.
058	HEB	007	013	For he unto whom these things were spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no one ministers at the altar:
058	HEB	007	014	for it is evident that our Lord sprang from Judah; in reference to which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priests.
058	HEB	007	015	And it is still more abundantly evident, if after the similitude of Melchizedek another priest rises,
058	HEB	007	016	who was not made after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.
058	HEB	007	017	For it is testified, Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.
058	HEB	007	018	For there is a disannulling of the preceding commandment, on account of its weakness and inadequacy
058	HEB	007	019	for the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope, by which we draw nigh unto God.
058	HEB	007	020	And in as much as it is without an oath, for the priests were made without an oath;
058	HEB	007	021	but He with an oath through the one saying to him, The Lord hath sworn, and will not regret it; thou art a priest forever;
058	HEB	007	022	insomuch that Jesus has also been made the mediator of a better covenant.
058	HEB	007	023	And indeed many have been made priests, because they were prohibited by death from continuing:
058	HEB	007	024	but he, because he abides forever, has an unchangeable priesthood:
058	HEB	007	025	wherefore he is also able to save to the uttermost those coming unto God through him, ever living to intercede for them.
058	HEB	007	026	For such a high priest was indeed appropriate unto us, holy, free from sin, undefiled, having been separated from the sinners, and being higher than the heavens;
058	HEB	007	027	who had not daily need, as the high priests, first to offer up sacrifices for their own sins, then those of the people: for he did this, having offered up himself once.
058	HEB	007	028	For the law institutes men high priests, having infirmity; but the word of the oath, which is after the law, the Son, having been made perfect forever.
058	HEB	008	001	But in addition to the things which having been spoken this is the principal thing: We have such a high priest, who sat on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven,
058	HEB	008	002	The minister of the holy things, and of the true tabernacle, which God pitched, and not man.
058	HEB	008	003	For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices: whence it is necessary to have something even that which he may offer.
058	HEB	008	004	If then indeed he was on the earth, he would not be a priest, there being those offering gifts according to law,
058	HEB	008	005	whosoever serve the pattern and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses about to complete the tabernacle was commanded: for, he says, See that you shall make all things after the pattern which was shown to you in the mount:
058	HEB	008	006	but now he has obtained a more excellent ministry, insomuch that he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which has been founded on better promises.
058	HEB	008	007	For if that first covenant had been faultless, a place would not have been sought for the second.
058	HEB	008	008	For finding fault with them, he says, Behold the days are coming, says the Lord, and I will perfect upon the house of Israel and upon the house of Judah, a new covenant:
058	HEB	008	009	not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they abode not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, says the Lord.
058	HEB	008	010	Because this is my covenant which I will establish with the house of Israel after these days, says the Lord; having given my laws in their mind, I will also write them on their heart; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be unto me a people.
058	HEB	008	011	And they shall no longer teach each one his neighbor, each one his brother, saying, Know ye the Lord: because all shall know me, from their small even unto the great.
058	HEB	008	012	Because I will be merciful unto their iniquities, and I will remember their sins no more.
058	HEB	008	013	In that he calls it new, he has made the first one old; but that which is old and antiquated is nigh unto vanishing.
058	HEB	009	001	Then indeed the first tabernacle also, had ordinances of service, and a sanctuary for this world.
058	HEB	009	002	For the first tabernacle was made; in which there were candlesticks, and the table, and shew-bread; which is called, Holy.
058	HEB	009	003	And after the second veil, was the tabernacle called Holy of holies;
058	HEB	009	004	having the golden altar, and the ark of the covenant overladen on all sides with gold, in which was the golden pot having the manna, and the rod of Aaron which budded, and the tables of the covenant;
058	HEB	009	005	and above this was the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat; concerning which things it is not pertinent to speak specifically.
058	HEB	009	006	And these having been thus adjusted, the priests come continually into the first tabernacle, performing the services:
058	HEB	009	007	and into the second comes the high priest alone once a year, not without blood, which he offers for himself, and the errors of the people;
058	HEB	009	008	the Holy Spirit showing this, the way of the holies has not yet been made manifest, the first tabernacle yet standing:
058	HEB	009	009	which is a figure unto the present time, in which gifts and sacrifices are offered, not being able to make the worshiper perfect, as to his conscience;
058	HEB	009	010	consisting only in meats and drinks, and divers baptisms, ordinances of the flesh, abiding until the time of restitution.
058	HEB	009	011	But Christ being a high priest of good things to come, through a greater and a more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is, not of this world;
058	HEB	009	012	neither through the blood of goats and bullocks, but through his own blood, came once into the holies, having found eternal redemption.
058	HEB	009	013	For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled, sanctifies unto the purification of the flesh;
058	HEB	009	014	how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered up himself without spot to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
058	HEB	009	015	And on this account he is mediator of the new covenant, since there being death, unto the redemption of the transgressions unto the first covenant, those having been called may receive the promise of eternal inheritance.
058	HEB	009	016	For where there is a covenant, it is necessary to bear the death of the covenanter;
058	HEB	009	017	for a covenant is valid in case of the dead: since it has no force while the covenanter lives.
058	HEB	009	018	Neither was the first covenant therefore dedicated without blood.
058	HEB	009	019	For every commandment having been spoken by Moses to all the people according to law, having taken the blood of bullocks and goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, he sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,
058	HEB	009	020	saying, This is the blood of the covenant which God established unto you.
058	HEB	009	021	And he likewise also sprinkled the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry, with blood.
058	HEB	009	022	And according to the law, almost all things are purified by blood; and without the shedding of blood there is no remission.
058	HEB	009	023	Therefore it is necessary that the pattern of the things in these heavens be purified; and the heavenly things themselves with greater sacrifices than these.
058	HEB	009	024	For Christ did not come into the sanctuaries made with hands, the pattern of the true; but into heaven itself, now to be made manifest unto the face of God in our behalf:
058	HEB	009	025	neither in order that he may frequently offer up himself, as the high priest goes into the holies once a year with the blood of another;
058	HEB	009	026	since it behooved him frequently to suffer from the foundation of the world: but now in the end of the ages he has been made manifest unto the removal of sin through the sacrifice of himself.
058	HEB	009	027	And inasmuch as it is appointed unto men once to die, and after this is the judgment:
058	HEB	009	028	so also Christ, having once been offered up to bear away the sins of many, will appear the second time apart from sin unto salvation to those expecting him.
058	HEB	010	001	For the law having the shadow of good things to come, not the real image of the things, annually with the same sacrifices which they offer continually, is by no means able to make perfect those coming to it:
058	HEB	010	002	since in that case would they not have ceased being offered, because the worshipers having once been purified would have had no more conscience of sins?
058	HEB	010	003	But in the same sacrifices there is a remembrance of sins annually;
058	HEB	010	004	for it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins.
058	HEB	010	005	Therefore, coming into the world, he says; Sacrifice an offering thou willest not, but thou hast perfected for me a body:
058	HEB	010	006	whole burnt offerings and offerings for sins thou wast not pleased with:
058	HEB	010	007	then I said, Lo, I come in the volume of the Book it has been written of me to do thy will, O God.
058	HEB	010	008	Saying above, that Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and offerings for sin thou didst not will, neither wast well pleased with; whatsoever are offered according to law;
058	HEB	010	009	then he has said, Lo, I come to do thy will. He takes away the first, that he may establish the second;
058	HEB	010	010	by which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
058	HEB	010	011	And every high priest indeed stands daily ministering, and frequently offering the same sacrifices, which are never able to take away sins:
058	HEB	010	012	and he, having offered up one sacrifice for sins, forever sat down on the right hand of God;
058	HEB	010	013	finally waiting until his enemies may be made the foot-stool of his feet.
058	HEB	010	014	For by one offering he has forever perfected the sanctified.
058	HEB	010	015	And the Holy Ghost truly does witness to us: for afterward he said,
058	HEB	010	016	This is the covenant that I will make unto them after these days, says the Lord; having given my laws on their hearts, and I will also write them in their mind;
058	HEB	010	017	and I will remember their sins and iniquities no more.
058	HEB	010	018	But where there is removal of these, there is no more offering for sin.
058	HEB	010	019	Then, brethren, having boldness unto the entering in of the holies through the blood of Jesus,
058	HEB	010	020	by which he has opened unto us a new and living way, through the veil, that is, of his flesh,
058	HEB	010	021	and having a great high priest over the house of God;
058	HEB	010	022	let us draw nigh with a true heart in a full assurance of faith, having been sprinkled as to our hearts from an evil conscience,
058	HEB	010	023	and washed as to our body with purifying water: let us hold fast the testimony of hope steadfast; for the one having promised is faithful;
058	HEB	010	024	and let us recognize one another in the provocation of divine love and good works:
058	HEB	010	025	not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as is the custom to some; but exhorting: and this the more, as you see the days drawing nigh.
058	HEB	010	026	For we sinning willingly after we have received the perfect knowledge of the truth, there is left no more sacrifice for sins,
058	HEB	010	027	but a certain fearful anticipation of judgment and violence of fire, about to devour the adversaries.
058	HEB	010	028	The one having rejected the law of Moses dies without mercy before two or three witnesses:
058	HEB	010	029	of how much more terrible punishment, do you think, the one having trodden under foot the Son of God, and counted the blood of the covenant, by which he was sanctified, common, and insulted the Spirit of grace; be counted worthy!
058	HEB	010	030	For we know him who said, Vengeance belongs to me, I will repay; and again, The Lord will judge his people.
058	HEB	010	031	It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
058	HEB	010	032	But remember the former days, in which, you being illuminated by the Spirit, endured a great fight of afflictions;
058	HEB	010	033	both indeed in reproaches and tribulations being exposed as a theater, and having become the companions of those being thus exercised.
058	HEB	010	034	For you suffered along with the prisoners, and received with joy the spoliation of your goods, knowing that you have a better and abiding possession.
058	HEB	010	035	Therefore cast not away your confidence, which has great reward.
058	HEB	010	036	For you have need of patience, in order that, having done the will of God, you will inherit the promise.
058	HEB	010	037	For yet a little while, the one coming will come, and will not tarry.
058	HEB	010	038	My righteous man shall live by faith: and if he may draw back, my soul has no pleasure in him.
058	HEB	010	039	But we are not of the drawing back unto perdition; but of faith unto the salvation of the soul.
058	HEB	011	001	But faith is the confidence of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.
058	HEB	011	002	For by it the elders receive the witness of the Spirit.
058	HEB	011	003	By faith we understand that the worlds were created by the word of God, and that which was seen was not made from things which are manifest.
058	HEB	011	004	By faith Abel offered up to God a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain, through which he received the witness that he was righteous, God witnessing to his gifts: and through it he having died is still speaking.
058	HEB	011	005	By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and he was not found because God translated him. For before he was translated he had the witness of the Spirit, that he pleased God:
058	HEB	011	006	but without faith it is impossible to please him: for it behooves the one coming unto God to believe that he is, and he is a rewarder unto them who seek him out.
058	HEB	011	007	By faith Noah, being warned concerning things not yet seen, being moved with fear, prepared an ark for the salvation of his family; by which he condemned the world, and became heir to the righteousness which is according to faith.
058	HEB	011	008	By faith Abraham, being called to go out into a place which he was about to receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and went out, not knowing whither he goes.
058	HEB	011	009	By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as a strange country, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow-heirs of the same promise:
058	HEB	011	010	for he anticipated a city having foundations, whose builder and maker is God.
058	HEB	011	011	And by faith Sarah herself received power unto the conception of seed, even past the time of age, since she considered him faithful who had promised.
058	HEB	011	012	Therefore indeed they were born of one, and those things of one having died, as the stars of heaven for multitude, and as the sands which are by the sea, which are innumerable.
058	HEB	011	013	These all died in the faith, not having received the promises, but seeing them afar off, and embracing them, and confessing that they are strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
058	HEB	011	014	For those speaking such things declare that they are seeking after a country of their own.
058	HEB	011	015	If indeed they remember that country from which they came out, they would have had an opportunity to return;
058	HEB	011	016	but now they seek a better country, that is, a heavenly. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he has prepared for them a city.
058	HEB	011	017	By faith Abraham, being tested, offered up Isaac: and the one having received the promises offered up his only begotten son,
058	HEB	011	018	in reference to whom it was said, In Isaac shall thy seed be called:
058	HEB	011	019	considering that God is able to raise him from the dead; whence he also received him in a figure.
058	HEB	011	020	By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.
058	HEB	011	021	By faith Jacob, when dying, blessed each one of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, on the hilt of his staff.
058	HEB	011	022	By faith Joseph, dying, made mention concerning the exodus of the children of Israel; and commanded concerning his own bones.
058	HEB	011	023	By faith Moses, having been born, was hidden three months by his parents, because they saw that he was a beautiful child; and did not fear the commandment of the king.
058	HEB	011	024	By faith Moses, having become an adult, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;
058	HEB	011	025	choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasure of sin for a season;
058	HEB	011	026	esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt: for he was looking unto the recompense of reward.
058	HEB	011	027	By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he went out, as seeing the invisible one.
058	HEB	011	028	By faith he instituted the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, in order that the one destroying the first-born might not touch them.
058	HEB	011	029	By faith they pass through the Red sea as through dry land: the undertaking of which the Egyptians having entered upon were drowned.
058	HEB	011	030	By faith the walls of Jericho fell, having been encompassed about seven days,
058	HEB	011	031	By faith Rahab the harlot perished not with the unbelievers, having received the spies with peace.
058	HEB	011	032	And what do I yet say? time will fail me relating concerning Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, and David, and Samuel, and the prophets:
058	HEB	011	033	who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness,
058	HEB	011	034	obtained promises, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness became filled up with dynamite, became mighty in war, put to flight the armies of the aliens:
058	HEB	011	035	women receive their dead from a resurrection: some were tortured, not accepting deliverance; in order that they might receive a better resurrection:
058	HEB	011	036	and others received the trial of scourgings and mockings, and still of bonds and imprisonment:
058	HEB	011	037	they were stoned, they were tempted, they were burnt, they died by the edge of the sword; they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins; being destitute, troubled, persecuted,
058	HEB	011	038	of whom the world was not worthy; wandering in deserts, and in mountains, and caves and dens of the earth.
058	HEB	011	039	And all these, having received the witness of the spirit through faith, did not obtain the promise:
058	HEB	011	040	God having reserved something better for us, that they might not be made perfect apart from us.
058	HEB	012	001	Therefore let us indeed, having around us so great a cloud of witnesses, having laid aside every weight, and the sin that doth so easily beset us, run with patience the race which is set before us,
058	HEB	012	002	looking unto Jesus the beginner and perfecter of our faith; who for the joy that was placed before him, endured the cross, looking with contempt at the shame, and has sat down on the right hand of the throne of God.
058	HEB	012	003	For consider him who has endured so great a contradiction of sinners against himself, in order that you may not become weary, fainting in your souls.
058	HEB	012	004	For you have not yet resisted unto blood, fighting against sin;
058	HEB	012	005	and you have forgotten the exhortation which reasoneth with you as with sons, My son regard not lightly the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art proven of him:
058	HEB	012	006	for whom the Lord loves he chastises, and scourges every son whom he receives.
058	HEB	012	007	Endure unto chastisement; God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom the father does not chastise?
058	HEB	012	008	And if you are without chastisement, of which all have been partakers, then are you bastards, and not sons.
058	HEB	012	009	Then indeed, we had fathers of our flesh who chastised us, and we endured: how much more then shall we submit to the Father of spirits, and live?
058	HEB	012	010	For they indeed for a few days were accustomed to chastise us according to that which seemed right to them; but he made unto our profit, in order that we might partake his holiness.
058	HEB	012	011	Indeed no chastisement for the present seems to be truly joyful, but sorrowful: but afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to them who have been disciplined by it.
058	HEB	012	012	Therefore hold up the hands which hang down, and the paralyzed knees,
058	HEB	012	013	and make straight paths for your feet, in order that whatsoever is lame may not be turned out of the way, but rather may it be healed.
058	HEB	012	014	Follow after peace with all men, and the sanctification, without which no one shall see the Lord:
058	HEB	012	015	looking diligently lest any one may fail from the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up may trouble you, and through it many may be defiled;
058	HEB	012	016	lest any one may be a fornicator, or a profane person, as was Esau, who for one morsel sold his birthright.
058	HEB	012	017	For you know that, wishing to inherit the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance even though having sought it diligently with tears.
058	HEB	012	018	For you have not come to the mountain that can be touched, and that is burnt with fire, and unto blackness and darkness, and tempest,
058	HEB	012	019	and to the sound of the trumpet, and the voice of words; which those having heard requested that the word should not be spoken unto them:
058	HEB	012	020	for they could not endure that which was spoken, If a wild beast should touch the mountain, it shall be pierced through with a dart:
058	HEB	012	021	and the sight was so fearful, Moses said, I exceedingly fear and tremble:
058	HEB	012	022	but you have come to mount Zion, and to the heavenly Jerusalem, to the city of the living God, and to myriads of angels,
058	HEB	012	023	to the whole company, and to the church of the first-born, who have been written in the heavens, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of justified people who have been made perfect,
058	HEB	012	024	and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, speaking something better than the blood of Abel.
058	HEB	012	025	See that you do not reject the one speaking: for if they escape not having rejected the one delivering them the divine oracles on earth, how much more shall we not escape, who turn away from the one speaking from the heavens:
058	HEB	012	026	whose voice then shook the earth; but now he has promised, saying, I will still once shake not only the earth, but also heaven.
058	HEB	012	027	But he would yet once show the removal of the things shaken, as having been created, in order that the things unshaken may remain.
058	HEB	012	028	Therefore receiving an unshaken kingdom, let us have grace, through which we may worship God acceptably with reverence and fear:
058	HEB	012	029	for our God is a consuming fire.
058	HEB	013	001	Let brotherly love continue.
058	HEB	013	002	Forget not hospitality: for by it some having entertained angels were incognizant.
058	HEB	013	003	Remember those bound, as having been bound along with them; those suffering persecutions, as you yourselves being also in the body.
058	HEB	013	004	Marriage is honorable among all, and the couch undefiled: for God will judge fornicators and adulterers.
058	HEB	013	005	Let your deportment be free from covetousness; being content with present things: for he said, I will not, I will not, leave you, neither do I ever forsake you;
058	HEB	013	006	so being confident we say, The Lord is my helper, I will not fear; what shall man do unto me?
058	HEB	013	007	Remember your leaders, who spoke to you the word of God: the outgoing of whose deportment seeing, imitate their faith.
058	HEB	013	008	Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to-day, and forever.
058	HEB	013	009	Be not carried away with fantastical and strange teachings: for it is good that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, in which those going round were not profited.
058	HEB	013	010	We have an altar, from which those ministering in the tabernacle have no right to eat.
058	HEB	013	011	For the bodies of those animals, whose blood is shed by the high priest in the sanctuary for sin, are utterly burnt up outside of the camp.
058	HEB	013	012	Therefore indeed Jesus, in order that he might sanctify the people by his own blood, suffered without the gate.
058	HEB	013	013	Therefore let us go forth to him without the camp, bearing his reproach;
058	HEB	013	014	for we have here no continuing city, but we are seeking unto one which is to come.
058	HEB	013	015	Therefore let us offer to God a sacrifice of praise continually, that is, the fruit of our lips, confessing to his name.
058	HEB	013	016	But do not forget benefaction and fellowship: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.
058	HEB	013	017	Obey your leaders, and be submissive: for they are watching for your souls, as they shall give an account that they may do this with joy and not with grief, for this is unprofitable to you.
058	HEB	013	018	Pray for us: for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience, wishing in all things to deport ourselves in harmony with the beauty of holiness.
058	HEB	013	019	But I the more exhort you to do this, that I may the more speedily be restored unto you.
058	HEB	013	020	And the God of peace, the one having raised up from the dead our Lord Jesus Christ, the great shepherd of the sheep, make you perfect, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,
058	HEB	013	021	in every good thing to do his will, doing that which is acceptable in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory unto the age of the ages. Amen.
058	HEB	013	022	But I exhort you, brethren, to receive the word of consolation: for I have indeed written unto you briefly.
058	HEB	013	023	Know our brother Timothy has departed; with whom, if he may come the more speedily, I shall see you.
058	HEB	013	024	Salute all your leaders, and all the saints. Those from Italy salute you.
058	HEB	013	025	Grace be with you all.

# BOOK	059	JAM	James	James
059	JAM	001	001	James, the servant of God and the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes who are in the Dispersion, greeting.
059	JAM	001	002	Count it all joy, my brethren, when you may fall into manifold temptations.
059	JAM	001	003	Knowing that the trial of your faith works out endurance.
059	JAM	001	004	But let endurance have its perfect work, in order that you may be perfect and whole in every part, lacking in nothing.
059	JAM	001	005	But if any of you lack wisdom, let him ask God, who gives to all cheerfully and upbraids none; and it will be given unto him.
059	JAM	001	006	But let him ask in faith, doubting as to nothing; for he that doubts is like unto a wave of the sea driven by the winds and tossed by the tempest.
059	JAM	001	007	For let not that man think that he will receive anything from the Lord,
059	JAM	001	008	the double-minded man, the most unstable in all his ways.
059	JAM	001	009	But let the humble brother boast in his exaltation:
059	JAM	001	010	and the rich man, in his humility: because as the flower of the grass he will pass away.
059	JAM	001	011	For the sun with a scorching wind has risen, and dried up the grass, and its flower fell off, and the beauty of its countenance perished: so indeed the rich man will pass away in his ways.
059	JAM	001	012	Happy is the man who endures temptation: because, being proved, he will receive a crown of life, which God has promised to those who love him with divine love.
059	JAM	001	013	Let no one being tempted say, I am tempted from God. For God can not be tempted with evils, and he tempts no one:
059	JAM	001	014	but each one is tempted by his own lusts, being drawn out, and enticed.
059	JAM	001	015	Then the lust, conceiving, brings forth sin; and sin, having been perfected, produces death.
059	JAM	001	016	Be not deceived, my beloved brethren.
059	JAM	001	017	Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of change.
059	JAM	001	018	Of his own will begat he us by the word of truth, that we should be some first fruit of his creations.
059	JAM	001	019	Know, my beloved brethren; but let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow toward wrath:
059	JAM	001	020	for the wrath of man works not the righteousness of God.
059	JAM	001	021	Therefore having laid aside all filthiness and excess of evil, receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.
059	JAM	001	022	But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.
059	JAM	001	023	For if any one is a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like a man beholding his natural face in a mirror:
059	JAM	001	024	for he recognized himself, and has gone away, and immediately forgot what kind he was.
059	JAM	001	025	But the one having looked into the perfect law which is the law of liberty, and having remained in it, not being a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, he shall be happy in his work.
059	JAM	001	026	But if any one seems to be religious, bridling not his own tongue, but deceiving his own heart, the religion of that man is vain.
059	JAM	001	027	Pure religion and undefiled with God even the Father is this, to relieve the orphans and widows in their affliction, and keep himself unspotted from the world.
059	JAM	002	001	My brethren, do not hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect to persons.
059	JAM	002	002	For if a gold-ringed man may come into your synagogue, in shining apparel, and a poor man may also come in with soiled clothing;
059	JAM	002	003	and you may look upon the one wearing the shining garment, and say, Sit thou here in a good place; and may say to the poor man, Stand thou there, or sit down beneath my footstool:
059	JAM	002	004	are you not condemned among yourselves, and have you not become the judges of evil reasonings?
059	JAM	002	005	Hear, my beloved brethren. Has not God chosen the poor in the world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to those who love him with divine love?
059	JAM	002	006	You have dishonored the poor. Do not the rich domineer over you, and drag you into courts?
059	JAM	002	007	Do they not blaspheme the good name which has been called upon you?
059	JAM	002	008	If indeed you keep the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbor with divine love as thyself, you do well.
059	JAM	002	009	But if you have respect of persons, you commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.
059	JAM	002	010	For whosoever may keep the whole law, and fail in one item, has become guilty of all.
059	JAM	002	011	For the one saying, Thou shalt not commit adultery also said, Thou shalt not murder; but if you do not commit adultery, but murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.
059	JAM	002	012	So you say, and so you do, as about to be condemned by the law of liberty.
059	JAM	002	013	For judgment is without mercy to him that shows no mercy; but mercy glorieth against judgment.
059	JAM	002	014	But what is it profitable, my brethren, if one may say he has faith, but has not works? whether is faith able to save him?
059	JAM	002	015	If a brother or sister may be naked, and may be destitute of daily food,
059	JAM	002	016	and one of you may say to them, Go in peace, be ye warmed, and be ye fed; and give them not the necessaries of the body; what profit is it?
059	JAM	002	017	So indeed faith, if it may not have works, is dead, as to itself.
059	JAM	002	018	But one will say, You have faith, and I have works: Show me your faith apart from works, and I will show you my faith by my works.
059	JAM	002	019	Do you believe that there is one God? you do well: the demons also believe and tremble.
059	JAM	002	020	Do you wish to know, O vain man, that faith apart from works is inefficient?
059	JAM	002	021	Was not Abraham our father justified by works, having offered up his son Isaac on the altar?
059	JAM	002	022	You see that faith wrought with his works, and by works the faith was made perfect;
059	JAM	002	023	and the scripture was fulfilled, saying, And Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the friend of God.
059	JAM	002	024	You see that a man is justified by works, and not only by faith.
059	JAM	002	025	And likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, having received the spies, and sent them out by another way?
059	JAM	002	026	For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so faith also apart from works is dead.
059	JAM	003	001	Be ye not many teachers, my brethren, knowing that we shall receive the greater judgment.
059	JAM	003	002	For we all fail in many things; if any one fails not in word, the same is a perfect man, able even to bridle the whole body.
059	JAM	003	003	But if we put bridles into the mouths of the horses, that they may obey us; and we manage their whole body;
059	JAM	003	004	behold also the ships, being so great, and driven by fierce winds, are managed by the smallest rudder, whithersoever the will of the steersman prefers;
059	JAM	003	005	so also the tongue is a little member, and it boasts great things. Behold, how great a wood a little fire kindles!
059	JAM	003	006	The tongue, a fire, the world of iniquity: the tongue sits down in the midst of our members, and corrupting the whole body, and setting on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire from hell.
059	JAM	003	007	For every nature both of wild beasts, and of birds, and of creeping things, and of oceanic animals, is subdued, and has been subjugated to human nature:
059	JAM	003	008	but no one of men is able to tame the tongue; an incorrigible evil, full of deadly poison.
059	JAM	003	009	With it we bless the Lord, even the Father; and with it we scold the people, who have been made after the image of God:
059	JAM	003	010	out of the same mouth come forth blessing and scolding. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.
059	JAM	003	011	Whether does the fountain out of the same chink send forth sweet water and bitter?
059	JAM	003	012	My brethren, whether is the fig-tree able to produce olives, or the vine figs? Neither is the bitter fountain able to produce sweet water.
059	JAM	003	013	Who is wise and instructed among you? Let him show forth out of beautiful conduct his works in meekness of wisdom.
059	JAM	003	014	But if you have bitter envy and strife in your heart, do not boast, and lie against the truth.
059	JAM	003	015	This is not the wisdom that comes down from above, but it is earthly, intellectual, and demoniacal.
059	JAM	003	016	For where there are envy and strife, there are contention and every evil work.
059	JAM	003	017	But the wisdom which is from above is indeed first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easily persuaded, full of mercy and of good works, free from partiality and hypocrisy.
059	JAM	003	018	But the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace to those who are making peace.
059	JAM	004	001	Whence come wars and whence come battles within you? are they not from thence, from your pleasures warring in your members?
059	JAM	004	002	You lust, and you have not: you murder, and you strive, and you are not able to obtain: you fight and you war; and have not, because you do not ask:
059	JAM	004	003	you ask, and you receive not, because you ask wickedly, that you may expend it in your pleasures.
059	JAM	004	004	O adulteresses, do you not know that the friendship of the world is enmity to God? Whosoever therefore may wish to be the friend of the world renders himself the enemy of God.
059	JAM	004	005	Whether do you think that the scripture says in vain, The spirit who dwells in us fights against envy?
059	JAM	004	006	and he gives more grace. Therefore he says, God resists the proud, and gives grace to the humble.
059	JAM	004	007	Therefore draw nigh unto God; and resist the devil, and he will flee from you:
059	JAM	004	008	draw nigh unto God, and he draws nigh unto you. Purify your hands, ye sinners; and cleanse your hearts, ye double-minded.
059	JAM	004	009	Weep, and mourn, lament: let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy into sorrow.
059	JAM	004	010	Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will raise you up.
059	JAM	004	011	Do not calumniate one another, brethren: the one speaking against his brother, and judging his brother, speaks against the law, and judges the law: if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge.
059	JAM	004	012	There is one lawgiver and judge, who is able to save and to destroy: but who are you, the one judging your neighbor.
059	JAM	004	013	Come now, ye who are saying, To-day or to-morrow we will go into that city, and abide there a year, and trade and accumulate:
059	JAM	004	014	whosoever do not know that which belongs to the morrow: for what is your life? For you are a vapor, appearing for a moment, and then vanishing away;
059	JAM	004	015	on the contrary you should say, If the Lord will, and we live, we will indeed do this, or that.
059	JAM	004	016	But you are now boasting in your arrogances: all such boasting is wicked.
059	JAM	004	017	Therefore to him that knows to do good, and does it not, to him it is sin.
059	JAM	005	001	Come now, ye rich, weep mourning over your calamities which are coming on you.
059	JAM	005	002	Your riches are corrupted, and your garments have become moth-eaten:
059	JAM	005	003	your gold and your silver are cankered; and their rust shall be for a witness against you, and eat your flesh like fire. You laid up treasures in the last days.
059	JAM	005	004	Behold, the wages of the laborers having reaped your fields, which is fraudulently kept back by you, is crying out: and the voices of the reapers have come into the ears of the Lord of hosts.
059	JAM	005	005	Ye flourished upon the earth, and were wanton; you nourished your hearts in the day of slaughter.
059	JAM	005	006	You condemned, you murdered the righteous; nothing antagonizes you.
059	JAM	005	007	Therefore, O brethren, suffer long, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer receives the precious fruit of the earth, waiting for it, until he may receive the former and latter rain:
059	JAM	005	008	you also suffer long; establish your hearts; because the coming of the Lord is nigh.
059	JAM	005	009	Do not complain against one another, brethren, in order that you may not be judged: behold, the judge stands before the doors.
059	JAM	005	010	Brethren, receive the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord as an example of suffering evil and longsuffering.
059	JAM	005	011	Behold, we pronounce them happy who have endured: you have heard the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord, because the Lord is very merciful, and sympathetic.
059	JAM	005	012	But, my brethren, before all, swear not, neither by heaven, or by earth, or any other oath: but let your conversation be yes yes; and no no; lest you may fall under condemnation.
059	JAM	005	013	Who is afflicted among you? let him pray. Who is merry? let him sing psalms.
059	JAM	005	014	Is any one sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.
059	JAM	005	015	Truly the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up; if he may have committed sins, they shall be forgiven unto him.
059	JAM	005	016	Therefore confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another, in order that you may be healed: the inward working prayer of a righteous man avails much.
059	JAM	005	017	Elijah was a man of like suffering to us, and he prayed with prayer that it might not rain, and it rained not upon the earth during three years and six months;
059	JAM	005	018	and again he prayed, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.
059	JAM	005	019	My brethren, if any one among you may err from the truth, and one may turn him back;
059	JAM	005	020	let him know, that the one having turned a sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and hide a multitude of sins.

# BOOK	060	1PE	1 Peter	1 Peter
060	1PE	001	001	Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the elect sojourners of the Dispersion of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
060	1PE	001	002	according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ. Grace to you, and peace, be multiplied.
060	1PE	001	003	Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the one having according to his great mercy begotten us again into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
060	1PE	001	004	unto an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and never fading, having been kept in the heavens unto you,
060	1PE	001	005	who are preserved by the power of God through faith unto the salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
060	1PE	001	006	In whom you rejoice, if however it is needful, being grieved a little while among manifold temptations: in order
060	1PE	001	007	that the trial of your faith, which is more precious than gold that perishes, however being tried by the fire, may be found unto praise and glory and honor in the revelation of Jesus Christ:
060	1PE	001	008	whom you not seeing, love with divine love; on whom, not looking, but believing, you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:
060	1PE	001	009	receiving the end of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
060	1PE	001	010	Concerning which salvation the prophets, who prophesied concerning the grace towards you, sought out and investigated,
060	1PE	001	011	searching into what, or what kind of time the Spirit of Christ who was in them, witnessing the sufferings towards Christ, and the glories after these, did show:
060	1PE	001	012	to whom it was revealed, because they were ministering not these things for themselves, but for you, which are now proclaimed unto you by those who preach to you the gospel with the Holy Ghost having been sent from heaven; into which things the angels desire to look down.
060	1PE	001	013	Therefore having girded up the loins of your minds, being perfectly sober, hope unto the grace which is conferred on you in the revelation of Jesus Christ.
060	1PE	001	014	As children of obedience, not being fashioned after your former lusts in ignorance:
060	1PE	001	015	but according to the Holy One who has called you. Be ye also holy in all your deportment;
060	1PE	001	016	because it has been written, Ye shall be holy; because I am holy.
060	1PE	001	017	And if you call upon the Father, the One judging without respect of persons according to the work of each, pass the time of your sojourn with fear,
060	1PE	001	018	knowing that you have been redeemed from your depraved character transmitted from your ancestors, not by corruptible things, silver or gold,
060	1PE	001	019	but by the precious blood of Christ, as a lamb without blemish and spotless:
060	1PE	001	020	foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world, but having been made manifest at the last of the times for the sake of you,
060	1PE	001	021	who through him are faithful toward God, who raised him from the dead, and gave him glory; so that your faith and hope are toward God.
060	1PE	001	022	Having purified your souls through obedience of the truth unto unhypocritical, brotherly love, fervently from the heart love one another with divine love:
060	1PE	001	023	having been begotten again, not of corruptible seed, but incorruptible, through the word of God, who lives and abides.
060	1PE	001	024	Therefore all flesh is as grass, and all its glory as the flower of grass: the grass is withered, and the flower fell off;
060	1PE	001	025	but the word of the Lord abides forever. And this is the word which has been preached unto you.
060	1PE	002	001	Therefore having laid aside all evil, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envyings, and all calumniations;
060	1PE	002	002	like newly born babes, desire the pure milk of the word, in order that you may grow thereby unto salvation:
060	1PE	002	003	if you have tasted that the Lord is good.
060	1PE	002	004	Unto whom going forth, to a living stone, indeed rejected by men, but elect with God, precious,
060	1PE	002	005	and you, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house, into a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices, acceptable unto God through Jesus Christ.
060	1PE	002	006	Because it runs thus in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone, elect, precious: and the one believing on him can not be ashamed.
060	1PE	002	007	Therefore to you who believe he is precious: but to the unbelievers, the stone which the builders rejected, the same has become the head of the corner, and the stone of stumbling, and the rock of offence,
060	1PE	002	008	who stumble over the word, disbelieving: unto which they indeed were appointed.
060	1PE	002	009	But you are an elect race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people unto conquest; in order that you may proclaim the virtues of the one having called you out of darkness unto his own marvelous light:
060	1PE	002	010	who at one time were no people, but now you are the people of God: who had not obtained mercy, lint just now having received mercy.
060	1PE	002	011	Beloved, I exhort you as pilgrims and strangers, to abstain from the carnal desire which wars against the soul;
060	1PE	002	012	having your deportment beautiful among the Gentiles: in order that in whatsoever they calumniate you as evil doers, seeing from your beautiful works, they may glorify God in the day of his visitation.
060	1PE	002	013	Submit to every human creature for the sake of the Lord: whether to the king as supereminent,
060	1PE	002	014	or to governors, as those having been sent out by him unto the condemnation of evil doers, and the praise of those doing good;
060	1PE	002	015	because thus it is the will of God, that doing good you should put to shame the ignorance of the ignorant people:
060	1PE	002	016	as free, and not as having the freedom as a cover of evil, but as servants of God.
060	1PE	002	017	Honor all people; love the brotherhood with divine love; fear God; honor the king.
060	1PE	002	018	Servants, be submissive to your masters with all reverence; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the wicked.
060	1PE	002	019	For this is grace, if, through the conscience of God, one bears sorrows and suffering unjustly.
060	1PE	002	020	For what glory is there, if, committing sin and being buffeted, you endure it? But if, doing good and suffering you endure it, this is grace with God.
060	1PE	002	021	For unto this you have been called: because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you may follow in his steps:
060	1PE	002	022	who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth,
060	1PE	002	023	who, being reviled, reviled not again; suffering, he threatened not, but gave up to the one judging righteously:
060	1PE	002	024	who himself has borne our sins in his own body on the wood, in order that we, being made free from sins, may live unto righteousness: by whose stripe you are healed.
060	1PE	002	025	For you have wandered away like sheep; but you have now turned to the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.
060	1PE	003	001	Likewise, ye wives, be submissive to your own husbands; in order that, if any do not believe the word, they shall be gained through the deportment of their wives, without the word;
060	1PE	003	002	beholding your chaste deportment which is with reverence:
060	1PE	003	003	whose beauty, let it not be the external beauty of braiding the hairs, and wearing golds, or putting on of outer garments;
060	1PE	003	004	but let their beauty be the hidden man of the heart, in the purity of the meek and quiet spirit, which in the sight of God is perfection complete.
060	1PE	003	005	For in this way in olden times the holy wives, the ones having hope toward God, were indeed accustomed to beautify themselves, submissive to their own husbands:
060	1PE	003	006	as Sarah submitted to Abraham, calling him Lord: whose children you have become, doing good, and not fearing any calamity.
060	1PE	003	007	Likewise, ye husbands, dwelling with the wife according to knowledge, as the weaker vessel, extending to them honor, as indeed the equal heirs of the grace of life; that your prayers should not be hindered.
060	1PE	003	008	And finally, all being like-minded, sympathetic, loving the brethren, merciful, humble:
060	1PE	003	009	not giving evil for evil, or railing for railing: but on the contrary blessing; because unto this you have been called, that you may inherit the blessing.
060	1PE	003	010	For let the one wishing to love life, and to see good days, cease his tongue from evil, and his lips from speaking guile:
060	1PE	003	011	let him depart from evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and pursue it:
060	1PE	003	012	because the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open to their cry: but the face of the Lord is against those doing evil.
060	1PE	003	013	Who is the one about to harm you, if you may be zealots of the good?
060	1PE	003	014	But if indeed you suffer for righteousness' sake, you are happy. Fear not their fear, neither be troubled;
060	1PE	003	015	but sanctify the Lord Christ in your hearts: being always ready for an answer to every one asking you a reason for the hope which is in you, but with meekness and fear:
060	1PE	003	016	having a good conscience, in order that, in whatsoever you are calumniated, those traducing your good deportment in Christ may be ashamed.
060	1PE	003	017	For it is better, doing good, if the will of the Lord should will it, to suffer, rather than doing evil.
060	1PE	003	018	Because Christ indeed once died for our sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, indeed being put to death in the flesh, but quickened in spirit:
060	1PE	003	019	by which also having gone he proclaimed to the spirits in prison;
060	1PE	003	020	who at one time were disobedient, when the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, the ark being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight souls were saved through the water.
060	1PE	003	021	Which antitype baptism does even now save you, not the removal of the filth of the flesh, but the seeking after a good conscience toward God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ:
060	1PE	003	022	who is on the right hand of God, having gone up into heaven; angels and authorities and powers being subordinated unto him.
060	1PE	004	001	Therefore Christ having suffered in the flesh, you also arm yourselves with the same mind: because the one having suffered in carnality has ceased from sin;
060	1PE	004	002	that he may no longer live the remaining time in carnality according to the lusts of men, but in the will of God.
060	1PE	004	003	For the past time is sufficient to have wrought the will of the heathens, walking in impurities, in lusts, in wine-drinkings, in revelries, in intemperance, and in unlawful idolatries:
060	1PE	004	004	in which they are astonished you not running to the same excess of wrath, blaspheming;
060	1PE	004	005	who shall give an account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
060	1PE	004	006	For, unto this the gospel was also preached to the dead, in order that they may indeed be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.
060	1PE	004	007	But the end of all things is at hand. Therefore be prudent, and sober unto prayers:
060	1PE	004	008	before all things having divine love stedfast toward one another; because divine love covers a multitude of sins:
060	1PE	004	009	being hospitable to one another without grudging;
060	1PE	004	010	as each one received the gift of grace, ministering the same to one another, as the good stewards of the manifold grace of God:
060	1PE	004	011	if any one speaks, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any one ministers, as from the strength which God supplies; in order that God may be glorified in all things through Jesus Christ; to whom there is glory and power unto the ages of the ages. Amen.
060	1PE	004	012	Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial among you, coming upon you unto your testing: as some strange thing happening to you:
060	1PE	004	013	but as you participate in the sufferings of Christ, rejoice; in order that you may also rejoice in the revelation of his glory, being glad.
060	1PE	004	014	If you suffer reproach in the name of Christ, happy are you, because the spirit of the glory and the spirit of God rest on you.
060	1PE	004	015	But let no one of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evil-doer, or as a meddler in other people's business:
060	1PE	004	016	but if as a Christian, be not ashamed, but glorify God in this name.
060	1PE	004	017	Because it is time that judgment should begin from the house of God: and if it is first from us, what shall be the end of those who obey not the gospel of God?
060	1PE	004	018	And if the righteous is scarcely saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?
060	1PE	004	019	So let those indeed suffering according to the will of God submit their souls to the faithful Creator, in good work.
060	1PE	005	001	Therefore I, being a fellow-elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, also a communicant of the glory which is about to be revealed, exhort the elders who are among you:
060	1PE	005	002	shepherdize the flock of God which is among you, not coercively, but willingly, for the sake of God; not for filthy lucre, but cheerfully.
060	1PE	005	003	Not as domineering over the heritages, but having become examples of the flock:
060	1PE	005	004	and chief Shepherd having appeared, you shall receive a crown of glory which will never fade away.
060	1PE	005	005	Likewise, you younger men, submit to the elders: and all put on humility toward one another; because God resists the proud, and gives grace to the humble.
060	1PE	005	006	Therefore humble yourselves beneath the mighty hand of God, that he may lift you up in due time:
060	1PE	005	007	having cast all your care upon him; because there is a care to him concerning you.
060	1PE	005	008	Be sober, watch. The devil is walking round like a roaring lion, seeking some one to devour:
060	1PE	005	009	whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that it is for you to complete the same sufferings in this world along with your brotherhood.
060	1PE	005	010	But the God of all grace, the one having called you into his own eternal glory in Christ, will himself make you perfect, having suffered a little while, will establish you, will strengthen you, will settle you.
060	1PE	005	011	To him is the power unto the age of the ages. Amen.
060	1PE	005	012	Through Silvanus, the faithful brother, as I consider, I have written unto you briefly, exhorting, and witnessing that this same grace of God is true in which you may stand.
060	1PE	005	013	The elect sister who is in Babylon, and my son Mark, salute you.
060	1PE	005	014	Salute one another with a holy kiss. Peace be unto you all who are in Christ.

# BOOK	061	2PE	2 Peter	2 Peter
061	2PE	001	001	Simon Peter, the servant of God and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those receiving like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.
061	2PE	001	002	Grace to you and peace be multiplied in the perfect knowledge of Jesus Christ, our Lord.
061	2PE	001	003	As His divine power having given unto us all things which appertain to life and godliness, through the perfect knowledge of the one having called us to his own glory and virtue:
061	2PE	001	004	through which precious and greatest promises have been given unto us; that through these you may be partakers of the divine nature, escaping the corruption that is in the world through lust.
061	2PE	001	005	And in harmony with this same thing also, add to your faith heroism; and to heroism, knowledge;
061	2PE	001	006	and to knowledge holiness; and to holiness patience; and patience, godliness;
061	2PE	001	007	and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness divine love.
061	2PE	001	008	For these things, being in you and overflowing, render you neither barren nor unfruitful in the perfect knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ;
061	2PE	001	009	for he unto whom these things are not present is blind, not seeing afar off, having received the forgetfulness of his purgation from his old sins.
061	2PE	001	010	Therefore, brethren, be the more diligent to make your calling and election sure: for doing these things you can never fall.
061	2PE	001	011	For in this way an entrance will be administered unto you abundantly into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
061	2PE	001	012	Therefore I will be about to always remind you concerning these things, even though knowing them, and being established in the present truth.
061	2PE	001	013	But I consider it righteous, so long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by remembrance;
061	2PE	001	014	knowing that the laying aside of my tabernacle is swift, as our Lord Jesus Christ also showed to me.
061	2PE	001	015	And I will endeavor to have each one of you after my departure make mention of these things.
061	2PE	001	016	For not having followed cunningly devised fables, have we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but having been eyewitnesses of his majesty.
061	2PE	001	017	For having received from God the Father the honor and glory of such a voice having been borne to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
061	2PE	001	018	We, being with him in the holy mount, heard this voice borne from heaven.
061	2PE	001	019	And we have the more certain word of prophecy; to which you do well giving heed, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day may dawn, and the morning-star may rise in your hearts:
061	2PE	001	020	know this in the first place, that no prophecy of scripture is of private interpretation.
061	2PE	001	021	For in the olden time prophecy did not come by the will of man: but men moved by the Holy Ghost spoke from God.
061	2PE	002	001	However there were indeed false prophets among the people, as there will also be false teachers among you, whosoever shall bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Lord who bought them, bringing on themselves swift destruction.
061	2PE	002	002	And many will follow their impurities; through whom the way of truth will be slandered:
061	2PE	002	003	and in their covetousness they will sell you with their soft speeches: unto whom judgment from olden time tarries not, and their destruction does not slumber.
061	2PE	002	004	For if God spared not the angels who sinned, but having sent them down to hell, committed them to chains of darkness to be kept unto judgment;
061	2PE	002	005	and spared not the old world, but delivered Noah the eighth person, the preacher of righteousness, brings the flood upon the world of the ungodly;
061	2PE	002	006	and having destroyed the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, with a catastrophe he condemned them, having put them forth as an example to those about to be ungodly:
061	2PE	002	007	and he delivered righteous Lot, being grieved by the deportment of the ungodly in their debauchery:
061	2PE	002	008	(for the righteous man dwelling among them, by seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds: )
061	2PE	002	009	for the Lord knows how to rescue the godly out of temptations, and to keep the unrighteous unto the day of judgment enduring punishment:
061	2PE	002	010	and especially those going after the flesh in the lust of pollution, and despising lordship. Audacious darers, blaspheming, they do not tremble at glories;
061	2PE	002	011	where the angels, being greater in strength and power, do not bring a blasphemous judgment against them before the Lord.
061	2PE	002	012	But these, like irrational animals having been born naturally for capture and destruction, blaspheming those things in which they are ignorant; in their own corruption they will indeed corrupt themselves;
061	2PE	002	013	receiving the reward of unrighteousness, esteeming pleasure which is in the daytime; luxury; spots and blemishes, swelling in their deceits, feasting along with you,
061	2PE	002	014	having eyes full of an adulteress, and unable to cease from sin; beguiling unestablished souls: having a heart which has been made fat with covetousness; children of the curse:
061	2PE	002	015	leaving the straight way, they have wandered off, following in the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the reward of iniquity; and had the conviction of his own conscience:
061	2PE	002	016	the dumb workbeast having spoken with the voice of a man, rebuked the madness of the prophet.
061	2PE	002	017	These are fountains without water, and mists driven away by the storm, for which the blackness of darkness has been reserved.
061	2PE	002	018	For speaking swelling words of vanity, in the lusts of the flesh they beguile with their impurities, those that have but partially escaped, who are still moving about in their delusion;
061	2PE	002	019	promising them liberty, they themselves being the slaves of corruption: for to whatsoever any one has been subordinated, to this he has become enslaved.
061	2PE	002	020	For if having escaped the pollutions of the world through the perfect knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and having again become entangled in these things, they are overcome, the last state has to them become worse than the first.
061	2PE	002	021	For it was better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, having known it, to turn away from the holy commandment which has been delivered unto them.
061	2PE	002	022	It has happened unto them according to the old proverb, The dog having returned to his own vomit; and the sow that had washed to wallowing in the mire.
061	2PE	003	001	I indeed, beloved, write unto you this second epistle; in which I stir up your pure mind by remembrance:
061	2PE	003	002	to remember the words which have been spoken hitherto by the holy prophets, and the commandment of the Lord and Saviour by your apostles:
061	2PE	003	003	knowing this first, that at the last days mockers will come forth in scoffing, walking according to their own lusts,
061	2PE	003	004	and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for from the day when the fathers fell asleep, all things remain as from the beginning of creation.
061	2PE	003	005	For they willingly forget this, that the heavens were in the olden time, and the earth standing out of the water and through the water, by the word of God;
061	2PE	003	006	by which the world at that time, being flooded with water, perished:
061	2PE	003	007	but now the heavens and the earth have been kept according to the same word, being reserved for fire in the day of judgment and the destruction of the ungodly people.
061	2PE	003	008	But let not this one thing be forgotten, beloved, that one day with the Lord is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
061	2PE	003	009	The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some people count slackness; but is long-suffering for your sakes, not wishing that any should perish, but all come to repentance.
061	2PE	003	010	But the day of the Lord will come like a thief; in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements being scorched up will be dissolved, and the earth and the works in it will be burnt up.
061	2PE	003	011	Then all these things being dissolved, what kind of people does it behoove you to be in holy deportment and godliness,
061	2PE	003	012	looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, in which the heavens being on fire will be dissolved, and the elements being scorched up are melted?
061	2PE	003	013	But, according to his promises, we are looking for new heavens and a new earth, wherein righteousness dwells.
061	2PE	003	014	Therefore, beloved, looking for these things, be diligent to be found spotless and blameless unto him in peace:
061	2PE	003	015	and consider the longsuffering of the Lord's salvation; as our beloved brother Paul according to the wisdom which was given unto him has written unto you;
061	2PE	003	016	as also in all his epistles, speaking in the same concerning these things; in which there are some things hard to understand, which the unlearned and unestablished wrest, as they also do the other scriptures, to their own destruction.
061	2PE	003	017	Then you, beloved, foreknowing watch, lest, having been led away by the delusion of the ungodly, you may fall from your own stedfastness:
061	2PE	003	018	but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and unto the day of the age.

# BOOK	062	1JO	1 John	1 John
062	1JO	001	001	That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have beheld, and our hands have handled, concerning the Word of the life;
062	1JO	001	002	and the life was made manifest, and we have seen, and we testify, and we proclaim to you the life which is eternal, which was with the Father, and has been made manifest unto us;
062	1JO	001	003	that which we have seen and heard we also proclaim to you, in order that you may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is indeed with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.
062	1JO	001	004	And we write the same things to you, in order that our joy may be full.
062	1JO	001	005	And the same message which we have heard from him, we also proclaim to you, that God is light and in him there is no darkness.
062	1JO	001	006	If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:
062	1JO	001	007	but if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.
062	1JO	001	008	But if we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
062	1JO	001	009	If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous that he may forgive us our sins, and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
062	1JO	001	010	If we may say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.
062	1JO	002	001	My little children, I write these things to you, in order that you may not sin. And if any one may sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:
062	1JO	002	002	he is the expiator for our sins: and not ours only, but indeed for the whole world.
062	1JO	002	003	And in this we know that we have known him, if we are keeping his commandments.
062	1JO	002	004	The one saying, I have known him, and keeping not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him;
062	1JO	002	005	but whosoever shall keep his word, truly the divine love of God has been made perfect in him. In this we know that we are in him.
062	1JO	002	006	The one saying that he abides in him ought himself so to walk about, as he also did walk about.
062	1JO	002	007	Beloved, I write no new commandment to you, but the old one which you had from the beginning; the old commandment is the word which you have heard.
062	1JO	002	008	Again I do write a new commandment to you, which is true in him and in you: because the darkness is passing away, and the true light is already shining.
062	1JO	002	009	The one saying that he is in the light, and hating his brother, is in the darkness until now.
062	1JO	002	010	The one loving his brother with divine love abides in the light, and there is no stumbling in him.
062	1JO	002	011	But the one hating his brother is in darkness, and walks about in darkness, and does not know whither he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.
062	1JO	002	012	I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven through his name.
062	1JO	002	013	I write unto you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because you have conquered the wicked one. I have written unto you, little children, because you have known the Father.
062	1JO	002	014	I have written unto you, fathers, because you have known him from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one.
062	1JO	002	015	Love not the world, nor the things that are in the world. If any one loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him:
062	1JO	002	016	because this is all that is in the world; the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, which is not of the Father, but is of the world.
062	1JO	002	017	The world and its lust are indeed passing away; but the one doing the will of God abides forever.
062	1JO	002	018	Little children, it is the last hour: and as you have heard that antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come, from which we know that it is the last hour.
062	1JO	002	019	They came out from us, but they were not of us; for if they were of us, they would have remained with us: but in order that they might be made manifest that they are not all of us.
062	1JO	002	020	You have an unction from the Holy One, and you all know.
062	1JO	002	021	I have not written unto you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it, and that no lie is of the truth.
062	1JO	002	022	Who is a liar except the one denying that Jesus is the Christ? This one is the antichrist, the one denying the Father and the Son.
062	1JO	002	023	No one denying the Son has the Father: the one confessing the Son has also the Father.
062	1JO	002	024	Let that which you heard from the beginning abide in you. If that which you heard from the beginning may abide in you, you also are abiding in the Son, and in the Father.
062	1JO	002	025	This is the message which he proclaimed unto you, eternal life.
062	1JO	002	026	I have written these things unto you concerning those deceiving you.
062	1JO	002	027	And the unction which you received from him abides in you, and you have no need that any one may teach you: but as his unction teaches you concerning all things, and it is true, and it is no lie, and as he has taught you, abide in him.
062	1JO	002	028	And now, little children, abide in him; in order that, if he may appear, we may have boldness, and not shrink with embarrassment from him in his presence.
062	1JO	002	029	If you may know that he is righteous, know that every one doing righteousness has been born of him.
062	1JO	003	001	Behold, what manner of love the Father has bestowed upon us, that we should be called the children of God; and we are. And on this account the world does not know us, because it did not know him.
062	1JO	003	002	Beloved, now are we the children of God, and it is not yet manifest what we shall be. We know that, if he may be made manifest, we shall be like him; because we shall see him as he is.
062	1JO	003	003	Indeed every one having this hope on him purifies himself, even as he is pure.
062	1JO	003	004	Every one doing sin does also a transgression of the law: and sin is the transgression of the law.
062	1JO	003	005	And you know that he was manifested that he might take away sins; and in him there is no sin.
062	1JO	003	006	No one abiding in him is sinning: every one sinning does not see him, nor know him.
062	1JO	003	007	Little children, let no one deceive you. The one doing righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous.
062	1JO	003	008	The one doing sin is of the devil; because the devil sins from the beginning. Unto this the Son of God was made manifest, that he might destroy the works of the devil.
062	1JO	003	009	Every one having been born of God does not sin; because his seed remains in him: and he is not able to sin, because he has been born of God.
062	1JO	003	010	In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: every one not doing righteousness is not of God, and the one not loving his brother with divine love.
062	1JO	003	011	Because this is the message which you heard from the beginning, that we must love one another,
062	1JO	003	012	not as Cain was of the evil one, and slew his brother; and on account of what did he slay him? Because his own works were evil, and those of his brother righteous.
062	1JO	003	013	And be not astonished, brother, if the world hates you.
062	1JO	003	014	We know that we have passed out of the death into the life, because we love the brethren with divine love; the one loving not with divine love, abides in the death.
062	1JO	003	015	Every one hating his brother is a murderer: and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in himself.
062	1JO	003	016	In this we know the divine love, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.
062	1JO	003	017	Whosoever may have the sustenance of the world, and see his brother having need, and shut up his sympathies from him, how dwells the divine love of God in him?
062	1JO	003	018	Little children, let us love with divine love not in word, nor in tongue; but in deed and in truth.
062	1JO	003	019	And in this we shall know that we are of the truth, and we shall assure our hearts before him;
062	1JO	003	020	because if our heart may condemn us, it is because God is greater than our heart, and he knows all things.
062	1JO	003	021	Beloved, if our heart may not condemn us, we have boldness toward God:
062	1JO	003	022	and whatsoever we may ask, we receive from him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things pleasing before him.
062	1JO	003	023	And this is his commandment, that we may believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and we may love one another with divine love, as he has given to us commandment.
062	1JO	003	024	And the one keeping his commandments abides in him, and he in him; and in this we know that he abides in us, he has given us of his Spirit.
062	1JO	004	001	Beloved, believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits if they are of God: because many false prophets have gone out into the world.
062	1JO	004	002	In this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit which confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God:
062	1JO	004	003	and every spirit which does not confess Jesus is not of God: and this is the spirit of antichrist, which you have heard that he is coming; and now he is already in the world.
062	1JO	004	004	You are of God, little children, and you have conquered them; because he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.
062	1JO	004	005	They are of the world: on this account they speak of the world, and the world hears them.
062	1JO	004	006	We are of God: the one knowing God hears us; he who is not of God does not hear us. From this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.
062	1JO	004	007	Beloved, let us love one another with divine love: because divine love is of God; and the one loving with divine love has been born of God, and knows God.
062	1JO	004	008	The one not loving with divine love does not know God; because God is divine love.
062	1JO	004	009	In this the divine love of God has been made manifest in us, because God has sent his only begotten Son into the world that we may live through him.
062	1JO	004	010	In him is divine love, not because we loved God with divine love, but because he loved us with divine love, and sent his Son an expiation for our sins.
062	1JO	004	011	Beloved, if God so loved us with divine love, we ought also to love one another with divine love.
062	1JO	004	012	No one has seen God at any time; if we love one another with divine love, God abides in us, and his divine love has been made perfect in us.
062	1JO	004	013	In this we know that we abide in him, and he in us, because he has given us of his spirit.
062	1JO	004	014	And we have seen and we testify that the Father has sent forth his Son the Saviour of the world.
062	1JO	004	015	Whosoever may confess that Jesus is the Son of God, in him God abides, and he in God.
062	1JO	004	016	And we have known and we have believed the divine love which God has in us. God is divine love; and the one abiding in divine love abides in God, and God abides in him.
062	1JO	004	017	In this the divine love has been made perfect in us, that we may have boldness in the day of the judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.
062	1JO	004	018	There is no fear in divine love; but perfect divine love casts out the fear: because the fear has torment; and the one fearing has not been made perfect in the divine love.
062	1JO	004	019	Let us love with divine love, because he himself first loved us with divine love.
062	1JO	004	020	If any one may say, I love God with divine love, and may hate his brother, he is a liar: for the one not loving his brother whom he has seen, with divine love, is not able to love God, whom he has not seen, with divine love.
062	1JO	004	021	And we have this precept from him, that the one loving God with divine love also loves his brother with divine love.
062	1JO	005	001	Every one believing that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God: and every one loving with divine love him who begat, also loves him who has been begotten of him, with divine love.
062	1JO	005	002	In this we know that we love the children of God with divine love, when we love God with divine love and keep his commandments.
062	1JO	005	003	For this is the divine love of God, that we may keep his commandments: and his commandments are not heavy:
062	1JO	005	004	because everything which has been born of God conquers the world: and this is the victory which has conquered the world, our faith.
062	1JO	005	005	Who is the one conquering the world, except the one believing that Jesus is the Son of God?
062	1JO	005	006	He is the one having come through water and blood, Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood; the Spirit is the one who bears witness, because the Spirit is the truth.
062	1JO	005	007	Because there are three who are bearing witness,
062	1JO	005	008	the Spirit and the water, and blood: and these three are one.
062	1JO	005	009	If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: because this is the witness of God that he has testified concerning his Son.
062	1JO	005	010	The one believing on the Son of God has the witness in himself: the one not believing God has made him a liar; because he has not believed in the testimony which God has testified concerning his Son.
062	1JO	005	011	And this is the testimony, that God has given unto us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
062	1JO	005	012	The one having the Son has the life; the one not having the Son of God has not the life.
062	1JO	005	013	I have written these things unto you, in order that you may know that you have eternal life; to those who believe on the name of the Son of God.
062	1JO	005	014	And this is the assurance which we have toward him, that, if we may ask anything according to his will, he hears us.
062	1JO	005	015	And if we know that he hears us as to whatsoever we may ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked from him.
062	1JO	005	016	If any one may see his brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask, and he will give him life to those sinning not unto death. There is a sin unto death; concerning this I do not say that you may ask.
062	1JO	005	017	All unrighteousness is sin: and there is sin not unto death.
062	1JO	005	018	We know that every one who has been born of God, sins not; but the one having been born of God keeps himself, and the evil one does not touch him.
062	1JO	005	019	We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the evil one.
062	1JO	005	020	But we know that the Son of God has come and has given unto us intelligence, that we know the truth. And we are in the true one, in his Son Jesus Christ; he is the true God, and eternal life.
062	1JO	005	021	Little children, keep yourselves from the idols.

063	2JO	001	002	on account of the truth which abides in us, and shall be with us forever.
063	2JO	001	003	Grace, mercy, peace, shall be with us from God our Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and in divine love.
063	2JO	001	004	I rejoice exceedingly because I have found some of thy children walking about in truth, as we received commandment from the Father.
063	2JO	001	005	And now I entreat thee, O Cyria, not as writing to thee a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another with divine love.
063	2JO	001	006	And this is the divine love, that we may walk about according to his commandments; this is the commandment, That, as you heard from the beginning, that you may walk about in it.
063	2JO	001	007	Because many deceivers have gone out into the world, who do not confess that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh; the same is the deceiver and the antichrist.
063	2JO	001	008	Take heed to yourselves, that you may not destroy those things which you have wrought, but may receive a full reward.
063	2JO	001	009	Every one going forth, and not abiding in the teaching of Christ, has not God; the one abiding in the teaching, the same has both the Father and the Son.
063	2JO	001	010	If any one comes to you, and does not bring this doctrine; do not receive him into your house, and do not bid him God speed:
063	2JO	001	011	for the one bidding him God speed partakes of his evil deeds.
063	2JO	001	012	Having many things to write to you, I would not write them with paper and ink: but I hope to come to you, and mouth to mouth to speak to you, in order that our joy may be full.

064	3JO	001	003	I rejoice exceedingly, the brethren coming and witnessing to thy truth, as thou art walking about in truth.
064	3JO	001	004	I have no greater joy than this, that I may hear of my children walking about in truth.
064	3JO	001	005	Beloved, whatsoever faithful deed thou mayest do to the brethren, thou art also dispensing to the strangers,
064	3JO	001	006	who have witnessed to thy divine love before the church: whom you will do well, having sent forth worthily of God.
064	3JO	001	007	For the sake of his name they went out, receiving nothing from the Gentiles.
064	3JO	001	008	Therefore we ought to receive such, in order that we may be fellow-workers with the truth.
064	3JO	001	009	I wrote something to the church, but Diotrephes, loving the preeminence over them, does not receive us.
064	3JO	001	010	On account of this, if I may come, I will remember his works which he is doing, berating us with wicked speeches: and not content with these, he does not receive the brethren, and he prohibits them wishing to receive them, and casts them out of the church.
064	3JO	001	011	Beloved, imitate not the evil, but the good. The one doing good is of God: the one doing evil has not seen God.
064	3JO	001	012	To Demetrius it has been testified by all, and by the truth itself: and we also testify: and you know that our testimony is true.
064	3JO	001	013	Having many things to write to you, but I do not wish to write them to you with ink and paper:

065	JUD	001	001	Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to the called beloved in God the Father, and kept in Jesus Christ.
065	JUD	001	002	Mercy to you, and peace, and divine love be multiplied.
065	JUD	001	003	Beloved, making all haste to write to you concerning our common salvation, I had need to write to you, exhorting you to agonize for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.
065	JUD	001	004	For certain men have crept in, who long ago were written down to this judgment, ungodly, transforming the grace of God into impurity, even denying Jesus Christ, our only Sovereign and Lord.
065	JUD	001	005	But I wish you to remember, once having known all these things, that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, destroyed them that believed riot, the second time:
065	JUD	001	006	and the angels who kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, has he kept in eternal chains unto darkness unto the judgment of the great day:
065	JUD	001	007	as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities about them, in a manner like unto them committing fornication, and going after other flesh, present an example receiving the vengeance of eternal fire.
065	JUD	001	008	Likewise indeed these dreamers also pollute the flesh, and reject lordship, and blaspheme glories.
065	JUD	001	009	But Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed over the body of Moses, did not dare to bring against him a judgment of blasphemy, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.
065	JUD	001	010	But these blaspheme so many things as they know not: and so many things as they understand naturally, like irrational animals, in these they are corrupted.
065	JUD	001	011	Woe unto them! because they have gone off in the way of Cain, and in the delusion of Balaam they have been seduced by reward, and they perished in the gainsaying of Korah.
065	JUD	001	012	These are rocks in your love-feasts, feasting along with you without fear shepherdizing themselves, clouds without water, driven away by the winds; withered trees, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;
065	JUD	001	013	wild waves of the sea, foaming out their own disgraces; wandering stars, for which the blackness of darkness has been reserved forever.
065	JUD	001	014	And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied against these, saying, Behold, the Lord came with his myriads of saints,
065	JUD	001	015	to execute judgment against all, and to convict all the ungodly of them for all the works of their ungodliness which they have impiously done, and for all their hard speeches which they have spoken against him, being ungodly sinners.
065	JUD	001	016	These are querulous grumblers, going forth according to their own lusts; and their mouth speaking swelling words, admiring persons for the sake of gain.
065	JUD	001	017	But you, beloved, remember the words which have hitherto been spoken by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;
065	JUD	001	018	that they said to you, At the last time there will be mockers, walking according to their own lusts after ungodly things.
065	JUD	001	019	These are they who are sidetracking [the people], intellectual, not having the Spirit.
065	JUD	001	020	But you, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,
065	JUD	001	021	keep yourselves in the divine love of God, receiving the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.
065	JUD	001	022	And some of whom indeed convict, being judged:
065	JUD	001	023	and some save, seizing them out of the fire; and some pity in their fear, you indeed hating the garment having been spotted by carnality.
065	JUD	001	024	But to him who is able to keep you from falling, and to establish you blameless in the presence of his glory with rejoicing.
065	JUD	001	025	to God our only Saviour, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion and power, before every age, both now, and unto all the ages. Amen.

066	REV	001	001	The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to show unto his servants the thing which it behooves speedily to come to pass; and he signified having sent by his angel to his servant John;
066	REV	001	002	who witnessed the word of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ, as to so many things as he saw.
066	REV	001	003	Blessed is the one reading, and those hearing the word of the prophecy, and keeping the things which have been written in it: for the time is at hand.
066	REV	001	004	John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace to you, and peace, from the one who is, and who was, and who is coming; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;
066	REV	001	005	and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the firstbegotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. To the one loving us with divine love, and having washed us from our sins in His own blood,
066	REV	001	006	and He made us a kingdom, priests unto God even his Father; to him be glory and dominion unto the ages of the ages; amen.
066	REV	001	007	Behold, he is coming with clouds; and every eye shall behold him, even those who pierced him, and all the tribes of the earth will wail at him; yes, Amen.
066	REV	001	008	I am Alpha and Omega, says the Lord God, who is and who was, and who is coming, the Almighty.
066	REV	001	009	I John, your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and in patience in Jesus, was in the island which is called Patmos, on account of the word of God, and on account of the testimony of Jesus.
066	REV	001	010	I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet
066	REV	001	011	saying, Write what you are seeing in a book, and send it to the seven churches; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamum, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.
066	REV	001	012	And I turned to see the voice which was speaking with me; and having turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;
066	REV	001	013	and in the midst of the candlesticks one like the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to his feet, and girded about the breast with a golden girdle.
066	REV	001	014	And his head and his hairs were as wool, white as snow; and his eyes were like a flame of fire;
066	REV	001	015	and his feet were like brass, as having been burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters,
066	REV	001	016	and having in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth is going forth a sharp two-edged sword: and his countenance like the sun shines in his strength.
066	REV	001	017	And when I saw him, I fell at his feet like a dead man; and he laid his right hand on me, saying, Fear not; I am the first and the last:
066	REV	001	018	the living one, and I was dead; and, behold, I am alive unto the ages of the ages, and I have the keys of death and of Hades.
066	REV	001	019	Therefore write the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which are about to take place after these;
066	REV	001	020	and the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven golden candlesticks are the seven churches.
066	REV	002	001	To the angel who is in the church at Ephesus write; The one holding the seven stars in his right hand, the one walking about in the midst of the golden candlesticks, says these things;
066	REV	002	002	I know your works, and your labor, and your patience, and that you are not able to bear the wicked; and you have tried those who say they are apostles, and are not, and have found them to be liars:
066	REV	002	003	and you have patience and have borne with them for my name's sake, and have not fainted.
066	REV	002	004	But I have something against you, because you have left your first love.
066	REV	002	005	Remember therefore whence you have fallen, and repent, and do your first works; lest I come to you, and shall move your candlestick out of its place, if you do not repent.
066	REV	002	006	But you have this, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
066	REV	002	007	Let the one having ears, hear what the Spirit says to the churches; to him who conquers I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God.
066	REV	002	008	And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write; The first and the last, who was dead, and is alive, says these things:
066	REV	002	009	I know your tribulations, and your poverty, but you are rich; and I know the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews, and they are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.
066	REV	002	010	Fear not those things which you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison, that you may be tested; and you shall have tribulation ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will give you a crown of life.
066	REV	002	011	Let the one having ears, hear what the Spirit says to the churches; The one conquering can never be hurt by the second death.
066	REV	002	012	To the angel of the church in Pergamum write; The one having the sharp, two-edged sword says these things;
066	REV	002	013	I know where you dwell, where the throne of Satan is: and you are holding fast my name, and did not deny my faith, in the days when Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwells.
066	REV	002	014	But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there those holding the teachings of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumblingblock before the sons of Israel, and to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication.
066	REV	002	015	So you also have those in a similar manner holding the teaching of the Nicolaitans.
066	REV	002	016	Repent; otherwise I am coming to you quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.
066	REV	002	017	Let the one having ears hear what the Spirit says to the churches; unto the one conquering will I give to him of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and on the stone my new name having been written, which no one knows but the one receiving it.
066	REV	002	018	And to the angel of the church among the Thyatireans write; The Son of God, the one having eyes like a flame of fire, and his feet like burnished brass, says these things;
066	REV	002	019	I know your works, and your divine love, and faith, and ministry, and patience, and your works: the last more than the first.
066	REV	002	020	But I have it against you, that you suffer the woman Jezebel, who says herself to be a prophet, and teaches and deceives my servants to commit fornication, and to cat things sacrificed to idols.
066	REV	002	021	And I gave her time that she might repent, and she does not wish to repent of her fornication.
066	REV	002	022	Behold, I cast her on a bed, and those who commit fornication along with her into great tribulation, until they shall repent of her works.
066	REV	002	023	And I will slay her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am the one searching the reins and the hearts: and I will give to you each according to your works.
066	REV	002	024	But I say to you, the rest who are among the Thyatireans, so many as have not this teaching, whosoever have not known the depth of Satan, as they say; I cast upon you no other burden.
066	REV	002	025	Moreover hold fast that which you have, until I shall come.
066	REV	002	026	And the one conquering and holding my works until the end, I will give unto him authority over the nations:
066	REV	002	027	and he will shepherdize them with an iron rod: as the potter's vessels are broken to pieces; as I have received of my Father:
066	REV	002	028	and I will give unto him the morning star.
066	REV	002	029	Let the one having ears, hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
066	REV	003	001	And to the angel of the church in Sardis write; The one having the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars, says these things; I know your works, that you have a name that you are living, and are dead.
066	REV	003	002	Be you watchful, and strengthen the remaining things, which are about to die. For I have not found your works perfect before my God.
066	REV	003	003	Remember therefore how you have received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If you do not watch, I will come as a thief, and you shall not know what hour I will come upon you.
066	REV	003	004	But you have a few names in Sardis who have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: because they are worthy.
066	REV	003	005	The one conquering shall thus be clothed in white garments; and I will not blot out his name from the book of life, and I will confess his name before my Father, and in the presence of his angels.
066	REV	003	006	Let the one having ears hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
066	REV	003	007	And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; The holy, true one, the one having the key of David, the one opening, and no one shall shut; and the one shutting, and no one shall open; says these things.
066	REV	003	008	I know your works; behold, I have given before you an open door, which no one is able to shut: and you have a little power, and you have kept my word, and not denied my name.
066	REV	003	009	Behold, I give of the synagogue of Satan, those who say they are Jews, and are not, but are lying; behold, I will make them that they shall come and worship before thy feet, and may know that I have loved thee with divine love.
066	REV	003	010	Because you have kept the word of my patience, and I will keep you from the hour of temptation, which is about to come upon the whole world, to try those dwelling upon the earth.
066	REV	003	011	I am coming quickly: hold fast that which you have, that no one may take your crown.
066	REV	003	012	The one conquering, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go out no more: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which is coming down out of heaven from my God: and my new name.
066	REV	003	013	Let the one having ears, hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
066	REV	003	014	And to the angel of the church in Laodicea write; The Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God, says these things;
066	REV	003	015	I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. I would that you were either cold or hot.
066	REV	003	016	Thus because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I am about to spew you out of my mouth.
066	REV	003	017	Because you are saying, That I am rich, and have increased in riches, and have need as to nothing, and do you not know that you are miserable, and pitiful, and poor, and blind, and naked?
066	REV	003	018	I counsel you to buy from me gold which has been purified by the fire, in order that you may be rich; and white garments, in order that you may be clothed, and the shame of your nakedness may not be exposed; and eye salve to anoint your eyes, that you may see.
066	REV	003	019	So many as I love, I rebuke and chastise; be zealous, and repent.
066	REV	003	020	Behold, I stand at the door, and am knocking: if any one may hear my voice, and may open the door, I will come in unto him, and will sup with him, and he with me.
066	REV	003	021	The one conquering, I will give unto him to sit with me on my throne, as I indeed have conquered, and sat down with my Father on his throne.
066	REV	003	022	Let the one having ears hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
066	REV	004	001	After these things I saw, and behold, a door was opened in the heaven: and the first voice I heard was as of a trumpet speaking with me; saying; Come up hither, and I will show thee the things which it behooves to come to pass after these.
066	REV	004	002	Immediately I was in the Spirit: and behold, a throne was set in the heaven, and on the throne one sitting,
066	REV	004	003	and the one sitting was in appearance like unto a jasper and a sardius stone: and a rainbow was around about the throne, in appearance like unto an emerald.
066	REV	004	004	And around about the throne were twenty-four thrones: and on the thrones twenty-four elders are sitting, clothed in white garments; and upon their heads golden crowns.
066	REV	004	005	And from the throne lightnings and voices and thunders are going out; and seven lamps of fire are burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God:
066	REV	004	006	and before the throne a glassy sea like crystal; and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, are four living creatures filled with eyes in front and in the rear.
066	REV	004	007	And the first living creature was like unto a lion, and the second living creature was like unto a bullock, and the third living creature having the face as of a man, and the fourth living creature was like unto a flying eagle.
066	REV	004	008	And the four living creatures having six wings, one opposite one of them; filled with eyes without and within; and they cease not day and night, saying; Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Omnipotent, who was, and who is, and who is the one coming.
066	REV	004	009	And when the living creatures shall give glory and honor and thanksgiving to the one sitting upon the throne, who lives unto the ages of the ages,
066	REV	004	010	the twenty-four elders will fall down before the one sitting upon the throne, and will worship Him who lives unto the ages of the ages, and will cast their crowns before the throne,
066	REV	004	011	saying, Thou art worthy, O Lord truly our God, to receive glory and honor and power: because thou hast created all things, and through thy will they were, and were created.
066	REV	005	001	And I saw upon the right hand of the one sitting upon the throne a book having been written within and without, having been sealed with seven seals.
066	REV	005	002	And I saw a mighty angel crying with a great voice, Who is able to open the book, and to loose its seals?
066	REV	005	003	And no one in the heaven, nor upon the earth, nor beneath the earth, was able to open the book, and to look into it.
066	REV	005	004	And I was weeping much, because no one was found worthy to open the book, or to look into it.
066	REV	005	005	And one of the elders says to me; Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered to open the book, and the seven seals.
066	REV	005	006	And I saw, in the midst of the throne and the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, the Lamb standing as having been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God having been sent into all the earth.
066	REV	005	007	And he came and took the book out of the right hand of the one sitting upon the throne.
066	REV	005	008	And when he took the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, having each a harp, and golden bowls filled with incense, which are the prayers of the saints.
066	REV	005	009	And they sing a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to receive the book, and to open its seals: because thou wast slain, and didst with thy blood redeem unto God out of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation;
066	REV	005	010	and didst make them a kingdom and priests unto our God: and they shall reign on the earth.
066	REV	005	011	And I saw, and I heard as it were a voice of many angels round about the throne, and the living creatures, and the elders: and their number was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands;
066	REV	005	012	saying with a great voice; Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and might, and honor, and glory, and blessing.
066	REV	005	013	And I heard all creation, which is in the heaven, and upon the earth, and beneath the earth, and in the sea, and all things which are in them, indeed saying, to the one sitting upon the throne, and to the Lamb, blessing, and honor, and glory, and dominion, unto the ages of the ages.
066	REV	005	014	And the four living creatures continued to say, Amen. And the elders fell and worshiped.
066	REV	006	001	And I saw when the Lamb opened the first of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures speaking, like a voice of thunder, Come.
066	REV	006	002	And I saw, and behold, a white horse: and the one sitting on him having a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and that he might conquer.
066	REV	006	003	And when he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, Come.
066	REV	006	004	And there went out a red horse: and to him sitting on him it was given to take peace from the earth, and that they shall slay one another: and a great sword was given him.
066	REV	006	005	And when he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, Come. And I saw; and behold a black horse; and the one sitting on him having a balance in his hand.
066	REV	006	006	And I heard as it were a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, A measure of wheat for a denarion, and three measures of barley for a denarion; and hurt not the oil and the wine.
066	REV	006	007	And when he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, Come.
066	REV	006	008	And I saw, and behold a livid horse: and the one sitting on him, to him the name was Death, and Hades followed along with him: and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to slay with the sword, and with famine, and with death, and with the wild beasts of the earth.
066	REV	006	009	And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw beneath the altar the souls of those who had been slain on account of the word of God, and the testimony which they had.
066	REV	006	010	And they cried with a great voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, do you not judge and avenge our blood from those who dwell upon the earth?
066	REV	006	011	And a white robe was given to each of them; and it was said to them, that they should wait a little while, until their fellow-servants and brethren, who are about to be slain as they were should be fulfilled.
066	REV	006	012	And I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the full moon became like blood;
066	REV	006	013	and the stars of the heaven fell upon the earth, as a fig-tree casting her unripe figs, when shaken by a mighty wind;
066	REV	006	014	and the heaven rolled away as a book is rolled up; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.
066	REV	006	015	And the kings of the earth, and the mighty men, and the chiliarchs, and the rich men, and the mighty men, and every slave, and every free man, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains,
066	REV	006	016	and they say to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of the one sitting upon the throne, and the wrath of the Lamb:
066	REV	006	017	because the great day of their wrath has come; and who is able to stand?
066	REV	007	001	And after this I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow upon the earth, nor the sea, nor upon any tree.
066	REV	007	002	And I saw another angel coming up from the rising of the sun, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a great voice to the four angels, to whom it was given unto them to hurt the earth and the sea,
066	REV	007	003	saying, Hurt not the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, until we may seal the servants of our God in their foreheads.
066	REV	007	004	And I heard the number of the sealed ones: a hundred and forty-four thousand were sealed out of every tribe of the sons of Israel?
066	REV	007	005	Out of the tribe of Judah twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand;
066	REV	007	006	of the tribe of Asher, twelve thousand; of the tribe of Napthali, twelve thousand; of the tribe of Manasseh, twelve thousand;
066	REV	007	007	of the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand; of the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand; of the tribe of Issachar, twelve thousand;
066	REV	007	008	of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve thousand; of the tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand; of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand.
066	REV	007	009	After these things I saw, and behold a great multitude, which no one was able to number, out of every nation, and tribes, and peoples, and tongues, standing before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, and palms in their hands;
066	REV	007	010	and they are crying with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God, the one sitting on the throne, and to the Lamb.
066	REV	007	011	And all the angels stood round about the throne, and the elders, and the four living creatures, and fell down before the throne on their faces, and worshiped God,
066	REV	007	012	saying, Amen: blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and strength, to our God unto the ages of the ages: Amen.
066	REV	007	013	And one of the elders responded, to me saying, Who are these who are clothed in white robes, and whence came they?
066	REV	007	014	And I said unto him, My lord, thou knowest. And he said to me; These are those coming up out of great tribulation, who have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
066	REV	007	015	On account of this they are before the throne of God, and they worship him day and night in his temple, and the one sitting upon the throne will spread his tabernacle over them.
066	REV	007	016	And they will never hunger or thirst any more; neither will the sun, or any heat, fall on them:
066	REV	007	017	because the Lamb in the midst of the throne will shepherdize them, and guide them to the fountains of the waters of life; and God will wipe every tear out of their eyes.
066	REV	008	001	And when he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about half an hour.
066	REV	008	002	And I saw the seven angels who stood before God; and seven trumpets were given unto them.
066	REV	008	003	And another angel came and stood before the altar, having a golden censer; and much incense was given to him, that he shall offer with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which is before the throne.
066	REV	008	004	And the smoke of the incense went up out of the hand of the angel, with the prayers of the saints, before God.
066	REV	008	005	And the angel took the censer, and filled it with the fire of the altar, and cast it to the earth: and there were thunders, and voices, and lightnings, and an earthquake.
066	REV	008	006	And the seven angels, those having the seven trumpets, prepared themselves that they should sound.
066	REV	008	007	And the first sounded, and there were hail and fire mingled with blood, and cast to the earth: and the third of the earth was burnt up, and the third of the trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.
066	REV	008	008	And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood;
066	REV	008	009	and the third of the creatures which were in the sea, those having life, died; and the third part of the ships was destroyed.
066	REV	008	010	And the third angel sounded; and a great star, burning like a lamp, fell from the heaven, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of the waters.
066	REV	008	011	And the name of the star is called Apsinth. And the third part of the waters became apsinth; and many of the men died from the waters, because they were bitter.
066	REV	008	012	And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars, were smitten; and the third part of them was darkened, and the day did not shine the third part of it, and likewise the night.
066	REV	008	013	And I saw, and I heard one eagle flying in the midst of heaven, saying with a great voice; Woe, woe, woe, to those dwelling upon the earth, on account of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, who are about to sound.
066	REV	009	001	And the fifth angel sounded; and I saw a star having fallen from the heaven to the earth; and the key of the pit of the abyss was given to him.
066	REV	009	002	And he opened the pit of the abyss, and smoke came out of the pit, like the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened from the smoke of the pit.
066	REV	009	003	And locusts came out of the smoke into the earth: and power was given unto them, as the scorpions of the earth have power.
066	REV	009	004	And it was said to them that they shall not hurt the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree; only the men who have not the seal of God upon their foreheads.
066	REV	009	005	And it was given to them that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when he may strike a man.
066	REV	009	006	And in those days men will seek death, and will not find it; and they will desire to die, and death flies from them.
066	REV	009	007	And the shapes of the locusts are like horses having been made ready for war; and upon their heads as it were crowns like gold, and their faces are like the faces of men.
066	REV	009	008	And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions.
066	REV	009	009	And they had breastplates as breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses rushing to war.
066	REV	009	010	And they have tails like scorpions, and stings: and their power is in their tails, to hurt men five months:
066	REV	009	011	and they have over them a king, the angel of the bottomless pit, to him the name is Abaddon in Hebrew, and in Greek he has the name Apollyon.
066	REV	009	012	One Woe is past; behold two Woes come yet after these things.
066	REV	009	013	And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard one voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,
066	REV	009	014	saying to the sixth angel the one having the trumpet, Loose the four angels which have been bound at the great river Euphrates.
066	REV	009	015	And the four angels were loosed, who were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, that they should slay the third part of the men.
066	REV	009	016	And the number of the armies of the cavalry was two myriads of myriads: I heard the number of them.
066	REV	009	017	And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those sitting on them, having breastplates as of fire, and of hyacinth, and of brimstone: and the heads of the horses were as of the heads of lions; and out of their mouths proceeds fire and smoke and brimstone.
066	REV	009	018	And from these three plagues the third of the men were slain, from the fire, and from the smoke, and from the brimstone, coming out of their mouth.
066	REV	009	019	For the power of the horses is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails are like serpents, having heads, and with them they do hurt.
066	REV	009	020	And the rest of the men who were not slain by these plagues did not repent of the works of their hands, that they should not worship demons, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and wood; which are neither able to see, nor to hear, nor to walk:
066	REV	009	021	and they did not repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.
066	REV	010	001	And I saw another mighty angel coming down out of the heaven, encircled with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire:
066	REV	010	002	and having in his hand a little open book. And he placed his right foot upon the sea, and his left upon the earth,
066	REV	010	003	and he cried with a loud voice, as a lion roars. And when he cried the seven thunders uttered their voices.
066	REV	010	004	And when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write: and I heard a voice speaking from the heaven, Seal those things which the seven thunders spoke, and write them not.
066	REV	010	005	And the angel, which I saw standing upon the sea and upon the land lifted up his right hand to the heaven,
066	REV	010	006	and he swore by him that liveth unto the ages of the ages, who created the heaven, and the things in it, and the earth, and the things in it, and the sea, and the things in it, that there shall be time no longer:
066	REV	010	007	but in the day of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, and the mystery of God may be finished, when he has preached the gospel to his servants the prophets.
066	REV	010	008	And the voice which I heard from the heaven again speaking with me, and saying, Go, take the little book which is open in the hands of the angel who stands upon the sea and upon the land.
066	REV	010	009	And I went away to the angel, saying to him, to give me the little book. He says to me, Take it, and eat it up; and it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey.
066	REV	010	010	And I took the little book out of the hand of the angel, and I ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and when I ate it, my stomach was bitter.
066	REV	010	011	And they say to me, It behooves you again to prophesy before the many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.
066	REV	011	001	And a reed like a rod was given unto me: saying, Arise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and those worshiping in it.
066	REV	011	002	And the outer court of the temple leave out, and measure it not; because it is given to the Gentiles: and they will tread down the holy city forty-two months.
066	REV	011	003	And I will give to my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.
066	REV	011	004	These are the two olive-trees, and the two candlesticks which are standing before the Lord of the earth.
066	REV	011	005	And if any one wishes to hurt them, fire goes forth out of their mouth, and devours their enemies: and if any one wishes to hurt them, thus it behooves him to be killed.
066	REV	011	006	They have power to shut up the heaven, that the rain may not fall during the days of their prophecy: and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to smite the earth with every plague, so often as they may wish.
066	REV	011	007	And when they may finish their testimony, the beast which ascends up out of the bottomless pit will make war against them, and conquer them, and slay them.
066	REV	011	008	And their dead body will lie in the street of the great city, which is spiritually called Sodom and Egypt, where the Lord also was crucified.
066	REV	011	009	And those of the peoples and of tribes and of the tongues and of the nations see their dead body three days and a half, and do not suffer their bodies to be put in a sepulchre.
066	REV	011	010	And those dwelling on the earth rejoice over them, and make merry, and send gifts to one another; because these prophets tormented those dwelling upon the earth.
066	REV	011	011	And after three and a half days the spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell on those seeing them.
066	REV	011	012	And they heard a great voice out of the heaven saying to them, Come up hither; and they ascended up into the heaven in a cloud; and their enemies saw them.
066	REV	011	013	And at that hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth of the city fell, and there were killed by the earthquake seven thousand persons: and the rest were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of the heaven.
066	REV	011	014	The second Woe is passed; behold, the third woe comes quickly.
066	REV	011	015	And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in the heaven, saying, The kingdom of this world has become the kingdom of our Lord, and his Christ; and he will reign until the ages of the ages.
066	REV	011	016	And the twenty-four elders, who are before God, who sit upon their thrones, fell upon their faces, and worshiped God,
066	REV	011	017	saying, We praise thee, O Lord God Omnipotent who is, and who was; and that thou hast received thy great power, and reigned.
066	REV	011	018	And the nations were wroth, and thy wrath has come, and the time of the dead to be judged, and to give reward to thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and to those who fear thy name, to the small and to the great; and to destroy them that destroy the earth.
066	REV	011	019	And the temple of God was opened in the heaven and the ark of His covenant was seen in his temple, and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and earthquakes, and a great hail.
066	REV	012	001	And there was a great sign in the heaven, a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars;
066	REV	012	002	and being in gestation, she also cries, travailing in pain, and suffering to bring forth.
066	REV	012	003	And there appeared another sign in the heaven; and behold the great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his heads seven diadems:
066	REV	012	004	and his tail draws the third of the stars of the heaven, and casts them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman about to bring forth, in order that he may eat up her child when she may bring it forth.
066	REV	012	005	And she brought forth a male son, who is about to shepherdize all the nations with an iron rod: and her child was caught up to God, and to his throne.
066	REV	012	006	And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has there a place prepared of God, that they may there nourish her a thousand and two hundred and sixty days.
066	REV	012	007	And there was war in the heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon.
066	REV	012	008	And the dragon and his angels fought, and they did not prevail; neither was their place found any more in the heaven.
066	REV	012	009	And the great dragon, the old serpent, the one called the devil, and Satan, the one deceiving the whole world, was cast out: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.
066	REV	012	010	And I heard a great voice in the heaven saying, Now has come salvation, and power, and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ: because the accuser of our brethren, the one accusing them before our God day and night, is cast out.
066	REV	012	011	And they conquered him through the blood of the Lamb, and the word of their testimony; and with divine love they love not their life unto death.
066	REV	012	012	Therefore rejoice, O ye heavens, and those dwelling in them; woe unto the earth and the sea! because the devil has come down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has little time.
066	REV	012	013	And when the dragon saw that he was cast out into the earth, he persecuted the woman, who brought forth the male child.
066	REV	012	014	And the two wings of a great eagle were given to the woman, that she might fly away into the wilderness, into her own place, where she is there nourished a time, and times, and a half time, from the face of the serpent.
066	REV	012	015	And the serpent cast out of his mouth after the woman water like a river, that he might cause her to be carried away by the river.
066	REV	012	016	And the earth helped the woman; and the earth opened her mouth, and drank up the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth.
066	REV	012	017	And the dragon was enraged at the woman, and went away to make war with the remnant of her seed, who keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus.
066	REV	013	001	And I stood upon the sand of the sea. And I saw a beast rising up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads; and upon his horns ten diadems, and upon his heads names of blasphemy.
066	REV	013	002	And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of lions: and the dragon gave him his power, and his throne, and great authority.
066	REV	013	003	And I saw one of his heads as it had been smitten unto death; and the wound of his death was healed. And the whole earth wondered after the beast:
066	REV	013	004	and they worshiped the dragon, because he gave authority to the beast; and they worshiped the beast, saying; Who is like the beast? and who is able to make war with him?
066	REV	013	005	and a mouth was given to him speaking great things and blasphemies; and authority was given unto him to prevail forty-two months.
066	REV	013	006	And he opened his mouth in blasphemies against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, those dwelling in the heaven.
066	REV	013	007	And it was given to him to make war with the saints and to conquer them: and authority was given unto him over every tribe, and people, and tongue, and nation.
066	REV	013	008	And all those who dwell upon the earth, whose name has not been written in the book of life of the Lamb that was slain from the foundation of the world, will worship him.
066	REV	013	009	if any one has ears, let him hear.
066	REV	013	010	If any one leads into captivity he goes into captivity: if any one kills with a sword, it behooves him to be killed with a sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.
066	REV	013	011	And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he continued to speak as the dragon.
066	REV	013	012	And he exercises all the authority of the first beast before him. And he makes the earth and those dwelling in it, that they shall worship the first beast, whose wound of his death was healed.
066	REV	013	013	And he performs great signs, so that he can indeed make fire descend out of the heaven to the earth in presence of the people.
066	REV	013	014	And he deceives those dwelling upon the earth through the signs which it was given unto him to perform in the presence of the beast, saying to those dwelling on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, who had the wound of the sword, and did live.
066	REV	013	015	And it was given unto him to give spirit to the image of the beast, in order that the image of the beast may indeed speak, and he may cause so many as will not worship the image of the beast that they should be killed.
066	REV	013	016	And he causes all, small and great, both rich and poor, both free and bond, that they may give them a mark on their right hand, or on their forehead:
066	REV	013	017	that no one may be able to buy or sell, except the one having the mark, the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
066	REV	013	018	Here is wisdom. Let the one having understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man. And his is, Six hundred and sixty-six.
066	REV	014	001	And I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on the mount Zion, and with him a hundred and forty-four thousand, having his name, and the name of his Father written on their foreheads.
066	REV	014	002	And I heard a voice from heaven, as the sound of many waters, and as the sound of a great thunder: and the sound which I heard was as the sound of harpers harping with their harps:
066	REV	014	003	and they are singing a new song before the throne, and in presence of the four living creatures, and the elders. And no one was able to learn the song except the hundred and forty-four thousand, who have been redeemed from the earth.
066	REV	014	004	These are they who have not been defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they who follow the Lamb whithersoever he may go. They have been redeemed from men, the first fruit unto God and the Lamb.
066	REV	014	005	And in their mouth no lie is found: for they are blameless.
066	REV	014	006	And I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven having the eternal gospel to preach to those dwelling upon the earth, and to every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people,
066	REV	014	007	saying with a great voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; because the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him who made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and the fountains of the waters.
066	REV	014	008	And another second angel followed, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, who has made all the nation to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.
066	REV	014	009	And another, the third angel followed these, saying with a great voice, If any one worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark upon his forehead, or upon his hand,
066	REV	014	010	and he shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, having been poured out without mixture in the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.
066	REV	014	011	And the smoke of their torment, ascends up into ages of ages: and they have no rest day and night, who worship the beast and his image, and if any one receives the mark of his name.
066	REV	014	012	Here is the faith of the saints: who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.
066	REV	014	013	And I heard a voice from the heaven saying, Write; Blessed are the dead immediately, who die in the Lord. Yea, says the Spirit, that they shall rest from their labors; for their works do follow along with them.
066	REV	014	014	And I saw, and behold a white cloud, and on the cloud one sitting like the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.
066	REV	014	015	And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a great voice to the one sitting on the cloud, Send forth your sickle, and reap: because the hour of reaping has come; because the harvest of the earth is fully ripe.
066	REV	014	016	And the one sitting on the cloud thrust in his sickle to the earth; and the earth was reaped.
066	REV	014	017	And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, himself also having a sharp sickle:
066	REV	014	018	and another angel came out from the altar, having power over the fire; and he called with a great voice to the one having the sharp sickle, Send in thy sharp sickle, and reap the clusters of the vintage of the earth; because her grapes are fully ripe.
066	REV	014	019	And the angel cast his sickle into the earth, and reaped the vintage of the earth, and cast it into the great wine-press of the wrath of God.
066	REV	014	020	And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out from the winepress, unto the trappings of the horses, one thousand and six hundred furlongs.
066	REV	015	001	And I saw another sign in the heaven, great and wonderful, seven angels having the seven last plagues; that in them the wrath of God is finished.
066	REV	015	002	And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and those who conquer from the beast, and from his image, and from the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.
066	REV	015	003	And they are singing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and wonderful are thy works, O Lord God Omnipotent; true and righteous are thy ways, thou King of the nations:
066	REV	015	004	Who may not fear, O Lord, and will not glorify thy name? because thou alone art holy; because all the nations shall come and worship before thee; because thy righteous acts have been made manifest.
066	REV	015	005	And after these things I saw, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in the heaven was open:
066	REV	015	006	and the seven angels, having the seven plagues, came out from the temple, clothed in clean, bright linen, and encircled about the breast with golden girdles.
066	REV	015	007	And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God who liveth unto the ages of the ages.
066	REV	015	008	And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no one was able to enter into the temple, until the seven plagues of the seven angels may be finished.
066	REV	016	001	And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of God upon the earth.
066	REV	016	002	and the first went away, and poured out his bowl upon the earth. And a destructive and grievous sore came on the men having the mark of the beast, and those worshiping his image.
066	REV	016	003	And the second poured out his bowl upon the sea; and it became as it were the blood of a dead man: and every soul of life died, whatsoever were in the sea.
066	REV	016	004	And the third poured out his bowl upon the rivers and fountains of the waters; and they became blood.
066	REV	016	005	And I heard the angel of the waters saying, Thou art worthy, who is, and who was, the Holy One, because thou hast judged these things;
066	REV	016	006	because they shed the blood of saints and of prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; they are worthy.
066	REV	016	007	And I heard one speaking from the altar, Yes, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments.
066	REV	016	008	And the fourth poured out his bowl upon the sun; and it was given unto him to scorch the people with fire.
066	REV	016	009	And the people were scorched with a great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, Who has power over these plagues: and they did not repent to give him glory.
066	REV	016	010	And the fifth poured out his bowl upon the throne of the beast; and his kingdom was filled with darkness; and they gnawed their tongues from the pain,
066	REV	016	011	and they blasphemed the God of the heavens on account of their pains and on account of their sores, and did not repent of their works.
066	REV	016	012	And the sixth poured out his bowl upon the great river Euphrates; and his water was dried up, that the way of the kings who are from the rising of the sun may be prepared.
066	REV	016	013	And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet;
066	REV	016	014	for these are the spirits of demons, working miracles, which go forth to the kings of the whole earth, to lead them together into the war of the great day of God Almighty.
066	REV	016	015	Behold, I am coming as a thief; blessed is the one watching and keeping his garments, in order that he may not walk about naked, and they may see his shame.
066	REV	016	016	And he led them into the place called Har-Mageden in the Hebrew.
066	REV	016	017	And the seventh poured out his bowl upon the air; and a great voice came out of the temple from the throne, saying, It is done.
066	REV	016	018	And there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not from the time man was upon the earth, such was so great an earthquake.
066	REV	016	019	And the great city was divided into three parts, and cities of the Gentiles fell. And great Babylon came into remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the wrath of his indignation.
066	REV	016	020	And every island fled, and the mountains were not found.
066	REV	016	021	And great hail like a talent comes down from the heaven upon the people; and the people blasphemed God, on account of the plague of the hail; because the plague of it was exceedingly great.
066	REV	017	001	And one of the seven angels having the seven bowls, came and spoke with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee the judgment of the great harlot, the one sitting upon many waters:
066	REV	017	002	with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication, and those dwelling upon the earth were made drunk from the wine of her fornication.
066	REV	017	003	And he carried me away in the Spirit into the wilderness. And I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast, having the names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.
066	REV	017	004	And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and gilded with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and the impurities of her fornication:
066	REV	017	005	and upon her forehead her name was written; Mystery, Babylon The Great, The Mother of Harlots And The Abominations of The Earth.
066	REV	017	006	And I saw the woman drunken from the blood of the saints, and from the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and seeing her, I was astonished with great astonishment.
066	REV	017	007	And the angel said to me, Wherefore wast thou astonished? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman and of the beast which carries her, having the seven heads and ten horns.
066	REV	017	008	The beast which you saw was, and is not; and is about to come up out of the abyss, and go into perdition: and those dwelling upon the earth, whose name has not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, will be astonished, seeing the beast, because he was, and is not, and will be.
066	REV	017	009	Here is a mind having wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, where the woman sits upon them,
066	REV	017	010	and there are seven kings; five have fallen, one is, and another is not yet come; and when he may come it behooves him to remain a little while.
066	REV	017	011	The beast which was, and is not, and the same is the eighth, and is of the seven, and is going into perdition.
066	REV	017	012	And the ten horns which you saw, are ten kings, who live not yet received a kingdom; but they receive authority as kings one hour with the beast.
066	REV	017	013	These have one mind, and they give their power and authority to the beast.
066	REV	017	014	These will make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall conquer them, because he is the Lord of lords, and King of kings: and with him are the called, and the elect, and the faithful.
066	REV	017	015	And he says to me, The waters which you saw, where the harlot sits, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.
066	REV	017	016	And the ten horns which you saw and the beast, these will hate the harlot, and will make her desolate and naked, and eat her flesh, and burn her up with fire;
066	REV	017	017	for God has given it into their hearts to do his mind, and to have one mind, and to give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.
066	REV	017	018	And the woman whom you saw is the great city, the one having dominion over the kings of the earth.
066	REV	018	001	After these things I saw another angel coming down out of the heaven, having great authority; and the earth was lighted with his glory.
066	REV	018	002	And he cried with a strong voice, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, and has become the habitation of demons, and the hold of every unclean spirit, and the den of every unclean and hateful bird;
066	REV	018	003	because all nations have fallen of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth have become rich from the costliness of her delicacy.
066	REV	018	004	And I heard another voice out of the heaven, saying, Come out from her, my people, in order that you may not partake of her sins, and in order that you may not receive of her plagues;
066	REV	018	005	because her sins have mounted up to heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities.
066	REV	018	006	Give unto her as indeed she has given, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she mixed, mix unto her double:
066	REV	018	007	as to so many things as she has glorified herself, and lived wantonly, give unto her so much torment and sorrow. Because she says in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow; and I see no sorrow;
066	REV	018	008	therefore in one day shall her plagues come, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burnt up with fire: because God, the one judging her, is a mighty Lord.
066	REV	018	009	And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication with her, and lived wantonly, will weep and wail over her, when they may see the smoke of her burning,
066	REV	018	010	and standing afar off on account of the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, the great city, the strong city, Babylon! because in one hour thy judgment came.
066	REV	018	011	And the merchants of the earth are weeping and mourning over her; because no one any longer buys their merchandise:
066	REV	018	012	their merchandise of gold, and of silver, and of precious stones, and of pearls, and of fine linen; and of purple, and of silk, and of scarlet, and all thyine wood, and every vessel of ivory, and every vessel of most valuable wood, and of brass, and of iron, and of marble;
066	REV	018	013	and cinnamon, and amomum, and incense, and myrrh, and libation, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and cattle, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and bodies and souls of men;
066	REV	018	014	and the fruit of thy soul's inordinate desire has departed from thee; and all things bright and shining have perished from thee, and they will no longer find them.
066	REV	018	015	The merchants of these things, who have grown rich from her, will stand a long way off on account of the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning;
066	REV	018	016	saying, Alas, alas, the great city, clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and gilded with gold, and precious stone, and pearl! because in one hour so great riches have come to desolation.
066	REV	018	017	And every pilot, and every one sailing to the place, both the sailors and so many as traverse the sea, stood a long way off,
066	REV	018	018	and they continued to cry seeing the smoke of her burning, saying, Who is like unto the great city?
066	REV	018	019	And they continued to cast dust upon their heads, and cry, weeping and mourning, saying, Alas, alas, the great city, in which all those having ships in the sea became rich from her costliness! that in one hour she is made desolate.
066	REV	018	020	Rejoice over her, O heaven, and the saints, and the apostles, and the prophets; because God has judged your judgment from her.
066	REV	018	021	And one strong angel lifted up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with a mighty fall shall Babylon the great city, be cast down, and can be found no more.
066	REV	018	022	And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and flute-players, and trumpeters, shall no more be heard in thee; and every artificer of every art shall no more be found in thee; and the sound of the mill shall no longer be heard in thee;
066	REV	018	023	and the light of a candle shall no more shine in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and the bride shall no longer be heard in thee: because thy merchants were the great men of the earth; because by thy sorcery all nations were deceived,
066	REV	018	024	truly in her is found the blood of prophets, and saints, and all those who have been slain upon the earth.
066	REV	019	001	After these things I heard as it were a great voice of a vast multitude in the heaven, saying, Hallelujah! Salvation, and glary, and power, belong to our God:
066	REV	019	002	because his judgments are true and righteous; because he has judged the great harlot, who corrupted the earth by her fornication, and he has avenged the blood of his servants from her hand.
066	REV	019	003	And a second time they said, Hallelujah! and her smoke is going up unto the ages of the ages.
066	REV	019	004	And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who sitteth upon the throne, saying Amen; Hallelujah!
066	REV	019	005	And a voice came out from the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, ye who fear him, small and great.
066	REV	019	006	And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the sound of many waters, and as the sound of mighty thunders, saying, Hallelujah! because the Lord our God Omnipotent reigned.
066	REV	019	007	Let us rejoice and be glad, and give glory to him! because the marriage of the Lamb has come, and his wife has made herself ready.
066	REV	019	008	And it was given unto her that she should be clothed in linen, bright and clean. For the linen is the righteous acts of the saints.
066	REV	019	009	And he says to me, Write, Blessed are they who have been called to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And He says to me, These are the true words of God.
066	REV	019	010	And I fell down before his feet to worship him. And he says to me; See that you do it not: I am your fellow-servant, and one of your brethren who have the testimony of Jesus; worship God. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.
066	REV	019	011	And I saw the heaven open, and behold a white horse; and one sitting on him called, Faithful and True, in righteousness he both judges and wages war.
066	REV	019	012	And his eyes are a flame of fire, and upon his head are many diadems; having a name written, which no one knows, but himself,
066	REV	019	013	and being clothed with a garment sprinkled with blood: and his name has been called, The Word of God.
066	REV	019	014	Armies in the heaven follow him on white horses, clothed in linen, white and clean.
066	REV	019	015	And out of his mouth goes forth a sharp sword, that with it he may smite the nations; and he will shepherdize them with an iron rod: and he treads the winepress of the wrath of the indignation of God Almighty.
066	REV	019	016	And he has on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, King of kings, and Lord of lords.
066	REV	019	017	And I saw one angel standing on the sun; and he cried with a great voice, saying to all the birds which fly in the midst of heaven, Come, gather yourselves to the great banquet of God;
066	REV	019	018	in order that you may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of chiliarchs, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and of those sitting on them, and the flesh of all free men and slaves also, both small and great.
066	REV	019	019	And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, assembled to make war with the one sitting on the horse, and with his army.
066	REV	019	020	And the beast, and the false prophet along with him, who wrought miracles in his presence, by which he deceived those having received the mark of the beast, and those worshiping his image; and the two were cast alive into the lake of fire which burns with brimstone.
066	REV	019	021	And the rest were slain with the sword proceeding out from the mouth of him, the one sitting on the horse: and all the birds were filled with their flesh.
066	REV	020	001	And I saw an angel coming down out of the heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit, and a great chain on his hand.
066	REV	020	002	And he laid hold on the dragon, who is the old serpent, who is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,
066	REV	020	003	and cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and put his seal on him, that he should deceive the nations no more, until the thousand years may be fulfilled: after these it behooves him to be loosed a little season.
066	REV	020	004	And I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded on account of the testimony of Jesus, and on account of the word of God, who did not worship the beast, nor his image, and they did not receive his mark on their forehead, and on their hand; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.
066	REV	020	005	The rest of the dead lived not until the thousand years were fulfilled. This is the first resurrection.
066	REV	020	006	Blessed and holy is the one having part in the first resurrection: over these the second death has no authority, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.
066	REV	020	007	And when the thousand years may be fulfilled, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,
066	REV	020	008	and he will go forth to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to the war: the number of them being as the sand of the sea.
066	REV	020	009	And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed about the camp of the saints, even the city which is beloved: and fire came down out of the heaven, and devoured them;
066	REV	020	010	and the devil, the one deceiving them, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also, and they shall be tormented day and night unto the ages of the ages.
066	REV	020	011	And I saw a great white throne, and him sitting on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.
066	REV	020	012	And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne; and the books were opened, and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of the things which were written in the books, according to their works.
066	REV	020	013	And the sea gave up the dead who are in it; and death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them; and they were judged each according to their works.
066	REV	020	014	And death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire.
066	REV	020	015	And if any one was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire.
066	REV	021	001	And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth passed away; and the sea is no more.
066	REV	021	002	And I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God, prepared as a bride is adorned for her husband.
066	REV	021	003	And I heard a great voice speaking from the throne, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with the people, and he will tabernacle with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them:
066	REV	021	004	and he will wipe every tear out of their eyes; and there will be no more death, neither will there be any more sorrow, nor crying, nor pain: because the former things have passed away.
066	REV	021	005	And the one sitting on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he says, Write: that these words are faithful and true.
066	REV	021	006	And he said to me, They are done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. To him who thirsts I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely.
066	REV	021	007	The one conquering shall inherit all things; and I will be to him God, and he shall be to me a son.
066	REV	021	008	But to the cowardly, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and the murderers, and the fornicators, and the sorcerers, and the idolaters, and all liars, shall be their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.
066	REV	021	009	And one of the seven angels having the seven bowls filled with the seven last plagues, came and spoke with me, saying, Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.
066	REV	021	010	And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God,
066	REV	021	011	having the glory of God: and her light was like a stone most precious, as a crystalline, jasper stone;
066	REV	021	012	having a wall great and high, having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written upon them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel.
066	REV	021	013	From the east, three gates; and from the north, three gates; and from the south, three gates; and from the west, three gates.
066	REV	021	014	And the wall of the city having twelve foundations, and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
066	REV	021	015	And the one speaking with me, had a measure, a golden reed, that he might measure the city, and its gates, and its wall.
066	REV	021	016	And the city lies foursquare, and its length is as great as the breadth. And he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs; and the length, and the breadth, and the height of it are equal.
066	REV	021	017	And he measured the wall of it, a hundred and forty-four cubits, the measure of the man, that is of the angel.
066	REV	021	018	And the building of the wall was jasper: and the city pure gold, like transparent glass.

066	REV	021	020	the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, hyacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.
066	REV	021	021	The twelve gates are twelve pearls; each one of the gates was of one pearl. And the street of the city is pure gold, like transparent glass.
066	REV	021	022	And I saw no temple in it: for the Lord God Almighty, and the Lamb, is its temple.
066	REV	021	023	And the city has no need of the sun, nor of the moon, that they may light it:
066	REV	021	024	and the nations will walk about through its light: and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it.
066	REV	021	025	And the gates of it shall in no wise be shut in the day, for there will be no night there;
066	REV	021	026	and they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it.
066	REV	021	027	And nothing unclean, and the one doing abomination, and falsehood, can at all enter into it: none except those who are written in the Lamb's book of life.

066	REV	022	002	In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, is the tree of life, producing twelve manner of fruits, yielding its fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.

066	REV	022	004	and they shall see his face; and his name shall be on their foreheads.
066	REV	022	005	And there shall be no more night; and they have no need of the light of a candle, nor the light of the sun; because the Lord God shines on them: and they shall reign until the ages of the ages.
066	REV	022	006	And he said to me, These words are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the spirits of the prophets has sent his angel to show to his servants the things which it behooves quickly to come to pass.
066	REV	022	007	Behold, I indeed am coming quickly. Blessed is the one keeping the words of the prophecy of this book.
066	REV	022	008	And I John am the one seeing and hearing these things; and when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel, the one showing me these things.
066	REV	022	009	And he says to me, See that you do it not: I am your fellow-servant, and one of your brethren the prophets, and of those keeping the words of this book: worship God.
066	REV	022	010	And he says to me; Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the season is nigh.
066	REV	022	011	Let the unrighteous one still continue to do injustice; and let the filthy one still be filthy; and let the righteous one still do righteousness; and let the holy one still be sanctified.
066	REV	022	012	Behold, I am coming quickly; and my reward is with me, to give unto each one as his work is.
066	REV	022	013	I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.
066	REV	022	014	Happy are those who wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life, and enter in through the gates into the city.
066	REV	022	015	For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and harlots, and murderers, and idolaters, and every one doing and loving falsehood.
066	REV	022	016	I Jesus sent my angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning-star.
066	REV	022	017	Both the Spirit and the bride are saying, Come. And let the one hearing say, Come. And let the one thirsting come; let the one who is willing receive the water of life freely.
066	REV	022	018	I testify to every one hearing the words of the prophecy of this book. If any one may add to these things, God will add unto him the plagues which are written in this book:
066	REV	022	019	and if any one may take from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take his part from the tree of life, and from the holy city, from the things which are written in this book.
066	REV	022	020	The one testifying these things says, Yes, I am coming quickly. Amen, come Lord Jesus.
066	REV	022	021	The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you all.
